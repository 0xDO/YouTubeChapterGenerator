Jeff goam have a stutter no not in the conventional sense but I do fumer a lot fumer is kind of a like that okay so uh if you're like me uh either as a writer or a Naros spicy person or a systems thinker whatever you might be fascinated by words and uh thesauruses and the English language in general so the word here is fumer Fu m f r and it is a very very rare word so I looked it up on Power Thesaurus and it says like Dole dilly dally loer so that's like that's not really even close to the definition so it's wrong there and then I asked GPT I said define fumer and it said the word fumer does not have a specific definition in English it could be a typo or madeup word and then I said Jeff Goldblum is the context and GPT said said yeah yes Jeff gold blo often uses the term fumer to describe his unique style of speech delivery so there's a couple things that are possibly happening here because it's able to like it it was either it whether e excuse me I'm fering now either it is being sycophantic which it's just trying to please me or it's confabulating uh where wherein it is just saying like oh yeah I know what you're talking about and just make some stuff up or um because basically when I said Jeff gold Blum so it can describe Jeff Goldblum and says okay let me just connect the dots and implicitly know that fumer means what Jeff Goldblum does now um I didn't say anything about speech or acting so the fact that it it says describe his unique uh style of speech delivery um means that okay the word fumer is in here somewhere it's embedded in GPT somewhere but even on its own that term doesn't get activated it has to be connected to something else some kind of context and so this is what I've talked about before where uh GPT is associative so the term fumer is semantically associated with Jeff Goldblum but it is not a strong enough uh semantic activation on its own to just say Define fumer um so let's try again real quick just to be a little bit more scientific um what does the word uh Thumper or fering [Music] mean so in this case it says like you know blah blah blah uh it's if it's intended to mean mumbling or Stam stammering in speech the correct term would be bumbling or fumbling um so that is again it's it's telling me like no this is not um but let me just say Jeff gold Blum this could be described as fering in a colloquial or playful sense although it is not Standard English term so in this case it is it it's kind of making the excuse or saying that this is a colloquialism um but here's the thing if you go to wiary the the informal us definition that it has is to speak awkwardly or evasively to dither or waffle so the information is out there and and in this case the the atmology says that it is derived from Yiddish so I don't know if Jeff gold Blum has Yiddish family and he just heard it cuz like having been married into a Yiddish family and having Yiddish family it's like we use all kinds of words like Schmutz and you know whatever um anyways so but here's the thing is it's a tested from 1954 it is definitely in the training data so what is the issue why is it that that GPT says I don't know anything about this but then if you say like if you connected to Jeff Goldblum it does know about it so my hypothesis here is that this has to do with lat and space activation but it also has to do with semantic distance so what I mean by semantic distance is if you were to map all the words and all their associations um and and spell it out with you know embeddings and and calculate the cosine distance there's probably it's probably in there somewhere but without the correct context because the thing is is many words they change their definition based on the context around them and that will that almost certainly affects the way that they're embedded so my hypothesis was what if we can have GPT prompt itself so this is not my first attempt at this kind of thing so I've used wordnet so this is a tool that I built three years ago um I'm an author I write fiction I write non-fiction and as someone who really likes to have the exact right word I've been looking for a tool to help me find the exact right word so like I own emotional an emotional thesaurus which is like a writing Aid um you know you can go to Power Thesaurus you can go to wiary um but like you can't just search like you know how does Jeff gold Bloom uh talk um on wiary it's going to say what are you talking about so my idea was to use like some kind of reverse you know thesaurus or a reverse dictionary so if you're not familiar the concept of a reverse dictionary or reverse thorus is where you describe the word and then it matches it and so that's what I tried to do here I downloaded this the englishword dictionary from this guy um which is good it's comprehensive and it's open source but even this didn't have the word fumer so I go over here search fumer doesn't have it so it's like okay in a list of literally almost 200,000 words this word is missing so like come on like it's it it's there it's not there and I understand that this is this is a a colloquialism it is uh off you know it's not technically a formal English word but it's there it's on wiary so after a bunch of fiddling around I am pleased to say that it still didn't work but in the process of trying to get GPT to tell me I came up with this really interesting prompting style that is based on that latent space activation idea as well as another concept that I call uh sequential Activation so as I was just talking about GPT seems to need some context in order to figure out you know to to get the right activations to activate the right semantic patterns or igen values or whatever uh the right associations in in the simplest term is Association so you might say like semantic distance it just means Association how closely associated is a word or term um or concept or idea or event how closely is it Associated within the embedded space of the neural net the network The Matrix math and multiplication that happens inside the thing hey Dave here with a real quick request uh I know a lot of you get a lot of uh benefit from watching my tutorials and my videos so in return I'm hoping that I can entice you to sign up for my patreon uh it really helps me so basically I'm asking help me help you um the more help that I get the more I can just do this full-time and keep cranking out useful tutorials uh my patreon has two tiers there's a $5 a month uh which gets you basic access to Discord we've got a huge and growing Community with lots of people I'll show you in just a second then I've also got a premium Discord tier which basically gives you access to a few private channels which ensures that I will see your message and I will make sure to respond to any uh queries within reason in the uh exclusive Discord we also do uh occasional live chats and and other uh private QA sessions on Discord but yeah so here's here's the private Discord um you can see here's the here's the the premium channels down here I'm not going to show you what what's in them um because I respect people's privacy but you know we have intros we've got special interest so if you're talking about AI from a scientific legal artistic medical perspective whatever we've also got some very specific artificial intelligence channels um so I've got a help wanted channel for anyone who has specific things we've also got a prompt engineering Channel um for people that need help with specific prompts I've also got the humanities channel so like we talk about metamodernism and post nihilism and neuros spicy stuff and posthumanism um so yeah uh Jump On In hope to see you here uh it really helps me out and uh yeah the community is Super Active um obviously not right this moment because it's pretty early in the morning I wake up before everyone else but yeah so Jump On In and uh thanks for your support because when you think about it like just take a step back and realize all these are doing is it's mathematical associations right now it's not a one-dimensional Association it's not even a two-dimensional Association it is a very High dimensional level of associations because as far as I know and maybe I'm wrong but I think gp4 is still densely connected and so what densely connected means is that each layer of the network um every node is connected to every other node at the layer above or below um which means that you can have very distal connections so a distal connection means that there's only a very thin tangential relationship between two terms but it can still be activated which is why I suspect um this this connection between fumer and Jeff gold Blum is there because until I mention Jeff goldl the connection is not strong enough so even though it's a very distal thin connection once I say like literally all I just said like here let's try this again in another way F gold Blum is the context so it's part of a conversation so now it it recognizes the connection and this is kind of like what happens in a human too cuz imagine like you know or remember a time that you're talking through something and like you can tell that there's a connection there but like that that edge of your knowledge of your mental Knowledge Graph isn't connecting but then you find that one tiny little link so what I'm trying to do is figure out how to get it to do it so let me just show you what I've done so here's here's the system prompt and what I did was rather than do it as a conversation I basically said this is this is your mission I gave it enough context to understand what its mission is because obviously like uh you know GPT models when properly prompted can be somewhat agentic um and so I gave it a mission because that's that's the necessary component for an agent is it has to have a purpose or some tasks that it's trying to do but then I also gave it a method so this is this is the this is kind of the primary thing that I wanted to show you and this will generalize Beyond just you know being a thesaurus or whatever um if you give GPT particularly GPT 4 is the first model that I have used that is really good at following longer processes um gpt3 absolutely absolutely wasn't and even in the early days gp4 uh would often get confused so I think there's some ongoing fine-tuning or training in the background that open AI is doing that's making it better at following multi-art steps or multi-step procedures uh which that implies all kinds of stuff about intelligence as well uh anyway so I gave it a methodology step one unpack the user query so discuss or otherwise explore the user's query take this opportunity to explore the semantic space from numerous angles and perspective Ives including lexical context cultural and soci sociological context and so on the idea here is to expand the scope of the discussion as much as possible um and then step two enumerate formal definitions given the description or query of the user restate the query in the form of of several formal definitions that may match the word or terms you're looking for so if you watched my video yesterday uh about the Basher Loops so Basher Loop is uh it stands for um brainstorm search hypothesize refine so this Basher Loop is what you do when you're trying to find information on the internet it is a procedure um likewise it's the same kind of procedure that uh that a librarian would engage with with you if you go to the library and you say hey I have I have an information need they'll brainstorm like okay is this the information need in a in a library setting it's called a reference interview um but it brainstorming is is the is the cognitive behavior that's happening there um and so that's one procedure and this is another procedure this is a procedure that you might use or that I might use or that someone might use in order to identify the correct word and so I've given it this procedure okay so enumerate formal definitions given the description uh you know do not include words just write the definition as though in a vacuum you should do at least three variations of the user request also your formal definition should be increasingly eccentric or esoteric in other words the user may not have described the word or term correctly use whatever context you can to explore the lexical space so what this is doing is it's this is an attempt by me to get it to say okay let's you know kind of use the throw some elbows and expand that that mathematical space those representations those associations so that we can get better results because again in this example here we can see that on its own it doesn't know what fumer is um but when I add the Jeff gold Blum context that creates enough you know neural activity inside the G pt4 Matrix that it's like oh I see the connection you know like ah I get it the light bulb goes on so we're trying to get those light bulb moments we're trying to get GPT to prompt itself in such a way that we'll get those light bulb moments but as you'll see we get close but no cigar so then finally after I provide it some context and it does uh two steps of self- prompting I say okay now go ahead and enumerate the common terms as most of you have noticed uh particularly some of my clients have noticed this to many people in the comments and many people on the forums is that GPT goes towards the average it favors the most common terminology just because mathematically speaking it's at the top of the bell curve that's all there is to it so I say let's go ahead and get that out of the way I know that's what you want to do you want to spam that you know the common words button so let's do that and that's why I did this here and I said okay now let's do the rare terms I said now that you've zeroed in on some common terms think of rare obscured or grandiloquent terms that may match the query for instance if the query is something like words that mean brusk or irritating go for eent eccentric words like vituperative one of my fellow creators I'm not going to name names but uh had some really nasty comments and uh and he said like if you're going to be so vituperative like go somewhere else and I said that is a great word I love that word um anyways you should enumerate at least 10 such rare definitions these terms should be related to the user's query as well as the formal definition you articulated so again keeping it in context the reason that I added this is because um left to its own devices GPT started just like wandering off into the Horizon just saying like oh you it's rare word times and it would give me a whole bunch of rare words that were not remotely relevant to the query then finally we do want it to be more tangential and so again this is where we want to try and Trigger those distal connections and so a distal connection is like imagine that you've got something on one side of your brain and you want it to connect to something on the opposite side of your brain that's what I mean by a distal Connection in this case the evidence of distal Connections in GPT is this fumer and then it's like I have no idea what you're talking about then I add Jeff gold it's like oh I know what you're talking about it's like okay we made the connection the Sparks are happening um okay so uh then we enumerate the tangential terms and finally I just tell it the formatting so let me show you what it did so here's here's what I put in what is the thing that some actors or whatever do where they kind of murmur or stammer there's a particular word for it it's some kind of verbal tick or something Jeff gold Blum is famous for it so I gave it all the context this is the search that I went for when I went and found this video so said unpack user query whoops come back come on the user is referring to a specific verbal Behavior or mannerism that is often associated with certain actors such as get Jeff Goldblum this Behavior involves a kind of murmuring or stammering which uh the user describes as a verbal tick it's important to note that this isn't necessarily speech disorder or impediment but rather a stylistic choice or habit that can contribute to an actor's unique person or character portrayal so in this case it very clearly understands the context it it is basically defining fumer without defining fper so it's like cool we've we've clearly got some activation the Sparks are going so my hopes were high uh only to be dashed on the rocks of reality and limitations of the technology I'm limited by the technology of my time it reminds me of uh the professor dude from uh iroot where he's like my my responses are limited you have to ask the right questions and it's really frustrating when you have to do that with GPT it's like anyways sorry I'm fering again um step two enumerate formal definitions a distinctive speech pattern characterized yada yada yada a stylistic device used in acting etc etc you get the idea a habitual mannerism in speech often used by actors okay great and it even characterizes it intermittent use of disfluencies such as murmuring stammering or pausing then it says in enumerate common terms stammering mum mumbling hesitation faltering stuttering halting drawing slurring Laing and babbling so those are all good terms which if if I was in the middle of writing a book and I needed to say and I wanted to find a thesaurus and it's like okay this character is what are they doing and I might say oh faltering that's the word I was looking for so this tool is already useful but we want to go deeper so then we move to step four enumerate rare terms this is where it gets really cool because I learned a whole bunch of words here dysarthia dysarthria I think that's how you say it a condition in which the muscles that generate speech are damaged weak or non-functional so this is I actually knew what this was I didn't know the word for it but basically like if you've had throat surgery or other injuries to your throat you might be like really HSE or unable to form certain terms because of like yeah so that's dysarthria probably not saying that right Aphasia so Aphasia is actually a brain disorder um the reason that this is in public Consciousness right now is because Bruce Willis has actually you famous actor has recently lost the ability to speak because he has Aphasia which is an awful awful deterior uh uh um uh condition um like I think it's a form of dementia anyways uh anarthria the dysphasia echolalia so echolalia if you're neuros spicy you probably know what this is um but it's basically where you impulsively or habitually uh imitate the people around you which is why a lot of us neuros spicy people are really good at accents so like every now and then I'll break break out a Southern accent or a Russian accent and people are like wow you're really good at that um yeah I'm not going to do it right now cuz I'm embarrassed anyways so we get all kinds of really cool like rare terms but none of them are quite what I'm looking for still these are really useful terms especially as I'm exploring this space so then finally enumerate tangential terms so this I was holding out hope to see if maybe it would figure out exactly what I was looking for uh monotone to vo uh Soliloquy aside so an aside is a good thing a remark or passage that is intended to be heard by the audience but unheard by the characters uh dramatic irony voice over narration dialogue monologue and voice acting so in this case what it did was it said okay we're we're obviously talking about acting so let's expand the the scope to talk about all the ways that that acting or you know maybe even film might be used um in terms of in terms of this vocal ization it still didn't make the connection so ultimately the the the very high bar that I set is a failure but this is a super useful tool and I've got it out here now um the video is already running a little long but the idea that I have is what if we combine this this self- prompting this sequential activation with retrieval augmented generation and so my my idea was you know obviously GPT can write definitions it knew the context if we were to plug in some of these contexts or definitions they're very similar to the wiary definition whoops a fumer so I'm wondering if uh if I can figure out how to down I I did download this but if I can figure out how to download it and unpack it because it's all like useless XML um we could probably use semantic search like vector embeddings in order to match those definitions to this term so anyways if you want to help me out with that that would be great um you know we can we can uh expand on this cu the idea is like let's come up with the perfect way to to accurately find any word or term that you want in the entire English language and I suspect that this that solving this search problem will Aid in in any other kind of search problems out there um whether you're looking for a corporate document or you know a chat log cuz like think of it this way this is a really this is basically the same size is a chat log so if we can figure out the best way to to triangulate very specific memories or records cuz from the from the computer's perspective it's all just numbers and words right it doesn't matter if it's a word definition or a chat log or an email um it's going to have a vector associated with it so anyways that's uh that's where I'm at today um yeah thanks for watching uh like subscribe ETA Etc you know the drill have a good one
