the White House and President Joe Biden just issued a sweeping executive order yesterday morning and it is uh quite a beast so we're not going to go through all of the details but I did want to show you the the original which is 20,000 words long um but I did take some Cliff's Notes so we'll go over that in just a second so you can look at the entire executive order here um but then there's also the White House published kind of a a high level overview but here's my not here's the key takeaways so first what you need to know is that there are 19 federal agencies that have received uh directives uh because of this executive order including the Department of Commerce nist which we already knew the Department of Defense Department of energy uh Homeland Security Department of Justice and uh the Department of Treasury were the ones that really stood out to me um and so one this is very comprehensive you rarely see executive orders that are this sweeping that basically involve I'm not going to say most cuz I don't know how many federal agencies there are I think there's over 60 um you know like the Department of Agriculture for instance was not included in this but some of the big ones namely the Department of Defense AKA The Pentagon the entire US military Homeland Security energy all kinds of uh of of agencies were involved in this so what were they told to do so the general themes that I saw were first and foremost uh safe secure and responsible development of of a across all sectors um including risk management education Transportation governance oversight etc etc it's that is pretty boilerplate that's nothing to write home about uh protecting civil rights privacy consumer and workers this is where it starts to get interesting obviously protecting civil rights this is America we love freedom yes go on uh go forth and and be prosperous privacy consumers this again is nothing uh to write home about the EU is actually a head of America as far as I can tell with respect to technology um and privacy and consumer protection but worker protection is one of the things that is kind of like hm so I was talking to a lot of people about this and basically you know me I am 100% in the in the camp of post labor economics let's get people out of the workforce so that we can do other stuff let's get off of the Rat Race let's get off of the the workaholic treadmill but uh most people are not there yet so my reading of this is that uh basically uh the president doesn't want to hurt his chances of reelection so he's not going to lean into post- labor economics instead he's going to make some perfunctory uh you know stuff saying like let's protect workers and in America if so for for my audience that's not in America um one thing that happens every presidential election cycle is that they go into coal country and steel country and the Rust Belt and they're like we're going to bring jobs back and it's never happens why cuz cold jobs are going away why because car jobs are going away and steel jobs are going away but they always make the noises to say we're going to bring jobs back now I will say that in some cases we are on Shoring jobs but usually those are jobs that don't go to bluecollar laborers like coal workers it's going to high-tech workers like chip Fabs and and solar and that sort of thing so anyways still the fact that the tone is being set at the highest level saying we're going to protect all of these things is really interesting uh now where it gets even even more interesting this is where it starts to uh be something really worth writing home about um incre uh increasing AI Innovation and competitiveness so Investments public private Partnerships standards uh updating uh intellectual property policy this is all stuff that I touched on with my gate framework and the gate community helped me brainstorm a few months ago so we're basically seeing like getting our entire wish list our entire Christmas list answered with this one uh executive order because the thing is uh you know let's just pick this apart Investments obviously the investment in AI is there but H having AI being invested in at the federal level is a good thing so you know there's already been some evidence that like you know the IRS and other federal agencies are starting to use AI I just did a video yesterday about NASA which is still a federal agency um that is using chat GPT which is great so what we want to see is we want to see this adoption curve accelerate now obviously you don't want to go at a break neck Pace you don't want to overly rely on novel Technologies uh that could make mistakes and harm people and so on and so forth but at the highest level the the highest office in the land is saying yes we you know this is this is permission to invest in these Technologies which is good so that's the first thing to to really that's really worth writing home about next is increasing AI expertise and capacity in the federal Workforce so this is very explicitly saying we want AI experts to be working for the the US government not just saying that we're going to you know increase AI competency out in the workforce it's saying we want to bring it inh housee which to me this is one of the best pieces of information because you know one of the one of the key things that that often happens with uh new technologies is that the federal government just says okay well we'll create an expert Advisory Board and then mostly ignore them but in this case it's saying no we want the we want in-house expertise um which is a pretty signicant investment I'm not going to apply because I never ever want to be a federal employee but for for those in my audience who are good prompt engineers and and know this stuff and are looking for jobs I encourage you to apply um if you're in America uh to be a federal employee because the benefits are good it's stable and uh I will vouch for a lot of you like a lot of you in the audience come up with really great ideas I'll make sure to include a link to how to apply the window for applying is going to close really fast it's I think it's November 17th so you got like 16 days or or whatever from from the publishing of this video to apply so get in the door quick uh now the other thing is coordinating AI efforts across federal agencies via new councils and I'll enumerate some of these new councils and and working groups in a second but when 19 plus federal agencies are ordered you're working together on this um that is a level of coordination that we have not seen um outside of Crisis right that is this is the level of coordination that we haven't seen since like World War II and uh you know the Red Scare and that sort of thing um so this is this is what proactive government looks like and I know that many of you in my audience are anti-government and I hear you and and I do agree that power always needs to be scrutinized which is why I'm making this video so that you are more aware of what the government is doing uh and then finally advancing International collaboration so this was this was layer six of uh of the gateau framework which is international cooperation so it's still focused on AI standards and risk management they're still not doing International research I still this is the one thing on my wish list that I have not seen anyone talking about and that is I want to see International if not Global cooperation on AI research not just guard rails not just uh not just regulation not just Watchdogs I want to see research positive research that is open source and Global now obviously I understand that there are reasons not to do that um because AI can be weaponized so you don't necessarily want to just you know open Pandora's Box there but still I think that it would behoove us to explicitly say this is a transformative technology that is on the scale of nuclear fusion and everything else that like we need to invest in this on an international level now uh last bit is I want to talk about some of those new entities that are created so notably missing from this um and this is what some people asked for was to create a cabinet level agency or a new agency this executive order does not create a new agency but instead it it basically orders all agencies to create new groups and new positions um within within those agencies in order to uh basically tackle AI so first and foremost the White House artificial intelligence Council so this is a uh this uh represent uh sorry reports directly to the president and the Deputy Chief of Staff so this is this is basically a highlevel expert group that Works directly with uh the highest office in the land so this is good I don't know who it's going to be in there um obviously if it gets contaminated with you know corporate interests and and uh and lobbyists that could be bad but I get the sense that they're not going to do that um so the other one is the chief Artificial Intelligence Officers to be designated within each Federal agency so basically they're creating a new sea level position for each uh agency listed which is basically creating some someone who is at the top of the of the food chain who is responsible for artificial intelligence so this is alongside what you might think of as a chief technology officer or a chief information security officer so now there's going to be a caio Chief AI officer which honestly um I would for all of you business people out there all of you entrepreneurs and CEOs I would recommend that all companies do this too uh when I was still doing consulting uh basically I recommended that some of my clients uh at least appoint a senior VP levels person who is head of AI um so but having a c-level person who is head of AI definitely uh on board with that so uh next up is uh internal AI governance boards um so this is basically like uh a governance board is like a board of advisers um but they often have a little bit more teeth and so these are the people who uh often select the officers um if I understand it correctly but they're the ones who who basically say okay this is the person that we need on this Council this is the person that we need as the chief AI officer so you have like The Watcher who watches the Watchers basically yeah anyways creating new boards HHS um AI task force so this is um this is a task force specifically for uh augmenting uh Health and Human Services so this is going to be uh this is going to fall under uh Department of Health Veterans Affairs that sorts of thing so this is actually really interesting to me that that they're specifically calling out Health and Human Services to create a new AI task force and I think the reason is because Healthcare is so expensive in America and so this gives me a lot of Hope if you watched uh one of my recent videos about my uh medical intake thing we have a tremendous opportunity before us to drastically reduce the cost of Healthcare in America because a huge part of it is just ingesting huge amounts of data making decisions allocating scarce resources and an ounce is worth of prevention of uh an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and so if we can use AI to to just do cost avoidance we could we could greatly lower the cost of of healthc care in America and honestly one thing that I think is that AI is the death nail for uh for insurance here in America most civilized Nations don't have a at least don't have the Reliance on Private health insurance that we um and so we basically have this entire apparatus in America where you have a management Bureau that is middlemen that all they do is they want their cut and the perverse incentives are insane for health insurance because they're incentivized to collect premiums but not pay them out uh which having worked for an insurance company I used to work for a workers comp insurance company I will say that insurance is uh in some respects it's almost like a sham because it's like you collect money on the promise that you'll pay out money when someone needs it but then you're incentivized to not pay it out or pay out as little as possible it seems kind of evil uh so anyways that's my uh getting off my Soap Box uh an AI Safety and Security Board so this is an advisory committee to the uh Homeland Security so this is really interesting and it's also not surprising because the DHS here in America uh is responsible for like monitoring the terrorists or whatever and so this is going to basically focus on the biological chemical nuclear and other high-risk uses that AI can have in terms of weaponizing it uh I suspect that all of these groups will be uh cooperating very closely with uh other entities such as the CIA FBA FBI and NSA um now again I I can hear some of you in the audience that are like oh great even more police force even more erosion of uh privacy and individual liberty and I agree we need to we need to scrutinize this but at the same time uh AI is a force multiplier it is a big Force multiplier uh and then finally Ai and Technology Talent task force that's a mouthful uh basically this is just preparing for you know developing AI talent because until we have AGI that can replace all human labors human labor and human cognitive uh labor is going to be the biggest bottleneck which is one reason that I make this YouTube channel is to help teach people Ai and then finally research coordination Network to enhance privacy or on privacy enhancing technologies that sounds very euphemistic um that's almost like uh you know a privacy enhancing technology is probably code for privacy degrading Technologies anyways that's that so you now are aware at a very high level all of the things that this executive order covers um so moving right along Andrew Ang uh came out yesterday or earlier this week and he said that big and this is something that I have talked about so the reason that I'm that I'm saying this is because this all goes directly into the narrative so he said that big Tech is using Scare Tactics to blow up the threat of AI in order to call for strictor regulation now he's kind of uh he's more of a minority V voice out there uh now that being said there are plenty of other people who are more in the like hey this has catastrophic potential um and I'm not going to say that I disagree um but one of the biggest things and if you're a fan of my channel you will know that I am I I I am very skeptical of Doomer narratives because again if it bleeds it leads right if it's scary if it's existential you get attention you get more social status and then you get your way so uh while I don't fully agree with his position I am glad that someone more prominent than myself is saying hey guys like let's be a little bit more reasonable about this and not uh not throw the baby out with the bath water so uh Elon Musk uh immediately fired back at Andrew Ang saying like no like this is bigger than you think um you know and the jury is still out like every time I run a poll about like where are we going to end up you know some people think like we are doomed um some people think it's going to be good most people kind of fall in the middle that that poll generally follows a bell curve where people are like eh you know a little bit better a little bit worse whatever so that's that um so now I wanted to move on to some of my own projects and give you some updates on the ace framework uh the Basher Loop and open Murphy so first is uh the framework um we as I mentioned in a recent video we did unfortunately lose our uh main team lead but we have had uh quite a few people step up we just welcomed our new architect and we're going to have a meeting uh first team meeting with our new architect uh later this week as well as hopefully uh a few other new team members but the reason for this uh for this video or uh this this thing is a call for participation so we need a couple more team members here let me zoom in a little bit so you can see this so we have an architect we have some lead developers stepping up um and and some other some other uh infrastructure Architects uh stepping in so now what I realize that we need is we need a product owner or program manager so this is someone who can basically take over for me someone who really understands the vision of this project um and can and can uh participate in all the meetings that I'm not able to participate in to uh basically help steer the whole project to steer the the everything towards the end goal working with the architect working with the team leaders and so on to make sure that the that the vision stays coherent another thing that we need and we might already have I've got a few people in the pipeline but we need a project manager so someone who's more familiar with agile and scrum um and this is going to be someone who works more closely with the developers to ensure that everyone knows what they're doing um and then finally we could use um some more roboticist electrical engineers uh people familiar with fabricating and mag megatronics particularly with humanoid robots um whether it's a hobby level you know the one of the first robots that we want to build is going to be you know 10 15 20 inches tall um and this is going to be for the open Murphy project which I'll go over in just a second um but yeah so uh anyone in those categories uh again it's volunteer only um and we do coordinate on Discord so you know if you've got 5 to 10 hours a week to uh dedicate to this project and you're on Discord um hit me up either on LinkedIn or on the discussion board here on the ace framework team um but yeah we're going to we're going to get it going again and we're going to keep it sustainable um our previous uh team leader was was a bit of a Taskmaster and almost burned the team out so we're going to slow down and make sure that we can uh we can sustain it um okay so that's the update on the ace framework let me go back a little bit all right and then next we've got the um Basher Loop so the Basher Loop is uh the brainstorm search hypothesize refine Loop and we've had I've had a few people do some really good contributions we had a member of the ace team um help out and then we had another person submit their own demo so I just wanted to to round out the video by kind of sharing a little bit of updates where we're at with this so first I'll show you demo O2 so demo O2 is a series of uh Jupiter notebooks uh python uh notebooks that you can run in collab um and basically this is not a full implementation of the Basher Loop but this this contributor did a really great job job of of showing you the whole process of preparing uh the data one one uh step at a time so in this first one he scrapes all of my YouTube videos uh and shows you the code so this is really great if you want to learn how to do that and in step two um he does all the speech to text and he uses whisper to uh render it all in speech to text so it's really good and you can see the whisper chunks here um that that were transcribed so that is good and of course Whisper is is right now state-of-the-art in terms of speech to text so this is a higher level of transcription than what I had done just pulling from YouTube uh step three is creating a vector database so this is the uh data store that we're going to be pulling from and then finally uh step four is just an example of searching that that Vector database um I think he uses pine cone here yeah Vector stor is pine cone uh you could use chrom ADB which is local um and pretty much all of these Vector stores run on the same underpinning technology the F AIS SS the the Facebook AI semantic search uh Library so pine cone uses that in the background chrom ADB uses that in the background as far as I know correct me if I'm wrong uh my info might might be out of date anyways so point is uh this is a great set of of collab notebooks that you can take a look at to get a better understanding of how to scrape and prepare this data and then what I the last thing I wanted to share was I updated my demo my basic demo that I'm working on all I did was get the pseudo code but I think it's still worth sharing so this is a little bit um here let's close this so this is this is a little bit clear because what I realized in looking at the at the contributions is that people didn't realize that it's actually like a fully nested Loop and so what I did was I I went ahead and wrote the pseudo code and uh added a little bit of todos but so the bash for Loop is brainstorm search hypothesize refine so the way that I set it up here is I've got a dedicated function for the Basher Loop and all you do is you pass it a query uh you'll probably also need to pass it a data source uh but again this is the point of this is just pseudo code so then you you instantiate an all search results list and an all hypotheses list so what this does is this approximates what spools up in your head when you're doing a Google search or when you're searching for information at the library because basically you need to keep track of everything that you have thought and everything that you have learned along the way and so then what you do is first you do a brainstorm so you brainstorm a bunch of search queries based on the main query and then any search results and hypotheses you already have so this is where the loop when you start off you don't have any prior search results and you don't have any prior hypotheses so this is what I call a naive search query so you just say okay cool let's just do a wild search uh out into the wild blue yonder and see what we get and so then what you do is you you do the brainstorm so this is a process where it's like okay let's look at the main query let's look at all the information we have and come up with some new search queries then you go insert you execute those search queries against your your data source whether that's a chroma DB or pine cone or SQL or whatever um so then you get all of that back oh and by the way I wanted to share a technology that one of my patreon supporters just told me about which is cohere rerank so cohere rerank is really cool because it uses these semantic Technologies to rerank the uh search results that you've gotten um and it's really powerful he created a demo uh pointed at some of my um some of my YouTube videos and it answers really well so um there'll be a link to that down in the description I think um if I remember uh so and if I don't remind me and I'll add it uh next up is so that's the search so basically you first is you say okay what am I looking for let me take a look at my notes and generate some new search queries then you accumulate those new search queries oops go away um and then you uh hypothesize so you say Okay based on the main query all the data that we've recovered and all of our previous hypotheses let's generate a new hypothesis let's say Okay Bas let's integrate all this new information and see if we have uh see if we have a new idea and then finally the refine step so the refine step is you could also say like recurse um or or restart or whatever uh but there's two checks so there's two tests first is satisfied um so satisficing is a port phanto of of satisfying and sufficing so basically uh this is going to be a semantic function you know call the llm um and you say uh let's pass it the main query the search results and the hypotheses and if you have satisficed the the query if you say yes we have arrived at the at the stage of good enough so then we can just return the results and the hypotheses and you will know that the search results and then the final hypothesis is the most accurate one um and then finally uh the last test is exhausted and so in this case you might have done as much searching as you can and there's just no more information to be foraged and so if you have exhausted your foraging grounds then you don't want to just keep uh looping forever so either one of these tests will exit the Basher Loop and then finally it goes back to the main Loop where you you return the evidence and hypothesis and you render a final answer now this is all pseudo code so if anyone wants to jump in and help me flesh this out please do so cuz I am Ultra busy I have four books that I'm working on plus a bunch of teams that I'm running and research that I'm doing on the side so I don't have time to finish this all right thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this cheers like subscribe etc etc you know the drill uh and I hope to see more of you on Discord we are almost at a community of 700 people uh the the uh conversations are getting really interesting and it's actually at a Tipping Point where I can't keep up with all the conversations that's why I have a second tier on patreon um that is gives you access to Dedicated channels so that I will see your questions and make sure that I answer them all right uh Dave out cheers
