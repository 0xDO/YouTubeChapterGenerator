hey everyone good morning David Shapiro here so uh I was looking at the NASA bidara uh chat which if you're not if you if if you're watching this I'm assuming that you've heard of it but if you haven't um basically it is a pretty epic prompt that NASA published apparently open source that is a biomimic designer and research assistant by Dara and so people are really fascinated by this and it's a it's a pretty comprehensive prompt um that it but what it does is it allows you to kind of walk through this really structured uh like problem solving thing and so it activates a lot of the Laten space that is in the model which I talked about in recent videos and so at first I was like well what's what's the appeal here cuz like this is just a big watt of text it's not an interesting architecture but then I was talking with some people on uh my patreon about it and they're like oh well you know it can do this this and this and it's biometic and so on and so forth so rather than show you what it can do the purpose of today's video is to show you is to teach you why this is cool and also so that you can think about how to do this yourself so the first thing that I want to point out is first you define the agent okay so you are byar B biomedic uh biology engineering so first it gives it a definition so this is a really great way to open any system prompt particularly for an interactive chatbot this establishes the the biggest possible Global Conta then the second thing it does is it gives it a goal or a mission so if you've seen my prompts you see that I always open with a mission so we start with context Mission and then a framework so the framework is very comprehensive um so you might say framework or procedure or methodology so you've probably seen in some of my chat uh prompts where I I might Define a procedure or a method so that's what this does it's implied um what the the biggest thing that I would change here is I would add add uh titles headers to this so I would say like you know context Mission uh procedure and so then there's a what is it six steps uh six-step procedure or five-step um so you know first is Define uh biologized abstract uh oh discover so they have a an error here where there's not an additional space um discover abstract and then finally emulate Nature's lessons and it gives a a tremendous amount of context as to how it wants it to uh approach each thing and so this kind of runs contrary to advice that I've given in the past so one piece of advice that I have often given uh often given people is less is more which in many cases is true and the reason that I gave that advice is because many people still approach prompt engineering um from an imperative programming perspective and what I mean by that is they're trying to tell it what to do on a very microscopic level um and they're trying to to think about it like conventional NLP like extract this and do this and and they you know when you're when when you have an engineer or a software developer trying to describe the process of like fixing punctuation I'm like no no no you're over complicating it just tell it to fix the punctuation and it can do it um so in that respect I'm kind of I'm not necessarily reversing my previous advice but like don't get lost in the details instead give it the very high level and then give it enough context and so in this case it is you're saying like you know recipe blueprint you know nature strategy emulation is an exploratory process so what you're doing is you're going through this really long process where you're just explaining the entire job um and then it also gives it a few questions to ask and then it also gives it so this is really cool so on top of a procedure it gives it a framework a set of assertions or what what I would call axioms these are axioms that it can that it can then base the rest of what it's going on and uh GPT is really good at this because if you don't give it these axiomatic assumptions or a system uh to follow or questions it'll kind of do its own thing and it'll default back to you know kind of the most common things but it's like no these are the principles that we want to to go by so taking a big step back this this big block of text actually just has a few sections first Global context second mission three method or procedure and then um four uh kind of some some uh like a system of questions I'm not quite sure what to call this um this is like kind of a subset of the procedure or methodology but then finally it's also got this framework or this set of principles that it wants it to operate by so this big gigantic wall of text is is pretty complicated but it's really only five sections if you get a lot out of my content please consider supporting me on patreon uh both tiers get you access to the exclusive Discord Community uh which is great it's popping we talk about all kinds of stuff ranging from AI news to uh stuff on my other channels uh and we talk about prompt engineering and all kinds of fun stuff so uh hop on over jump into the discussion and I look forward to seeing you there thanks so I wanted to show you some uh some things that I have done that are similar so here's my commander data chat Discord chat bot which um is is similar and I'm not running it right now because it ended up being really repetitive so I need to do a little bit of work but I wanted to show you because I had some really similar ideas here so first mission and you can see here where the the biggest difference between what I've done and what the NASA one does is I provide it with a markdown headers this is not strictly necessary I've had people ask me like why do you do you know hashtag mission in all caps um there's there one it's it's easier to read right it is it is better for for human readable which means that it's easier to work on but also gp4 has an understanding of markdown um and so it understands oh this is a header this is a title and so by giving it that clear demarcation uh you can you can get better performance I've seen people test where you do like it uppercase lowercase um I've seen people go Bonkers with the hashtags you know doing like eight hashtags in a row and doing vertical lines I'm like you're just wasting tokens at that point um so this I feel like strikes a balance between being token efficient and also human readable so I give it a mission I give it a background um and you know so again Mission context Mission cont you can see that that is something that's in parallel interaction schema so in this case I tell it how to interact with the user basically saying like hey you're an API this is how I want you to behave then I give it a personality uh and then I give it some response ideas so I give it um four like kind of four categories as to like hey you're a chatbot that and I want you to pick one of these right you know give social commentary give predictions ask some questions or do moderation um and then I gave it some general guidelines so you can see there's like this is like almost one for one the same exact format as the NASA prompt um but just with obviously a fundamentally different purpose now I like I said I switched this one off because it became really dry and repetitive so I could come back and workshop this but I wanted to show you one more so this is another kind of very comprehensive um framework uh prompt so this is this is the prompt that I made for layer one of the ace framework and if you're not familiar with layer one of the ace framework this is the aspirational layer this is what provides the highest level of judgment and purpose for an entire autonomous entity and you can see that it is a pretty long one and so in this case overview again establishing context and then I give it actually a little bit more context by by saying like Okay this is what the ace framework is and this is how it works so I say you know first I say this is what you are this is what the ace framework is so I'm adding more context and then I give it another thing so this is the this is the principles or methodology section and so I say here's the Frameworks that you're going to use to make judgments heris to imperatives so if you're not familiar with my heris to imperatives it's reduce suffering in the universe increase prosperity and increase understanding um so this is like the highest moral framework so I'm saying this is this is the litmus test by which you used to make all judgments and then I give it a secondary framework the universal Declaration of Human Rights this could be the EU Charter on human rights but the point is is that it it it is axiomatically aligned because all uh GPT models within their training data have a tremendous amount of knowledge about human rights so basically all you have to say is adhere you know uphold human rights and it understands what that is so this is this this could be simpler and then finally I give it a very purpose uh very directed purposeful Mission and in this case it is my personal mission which is uh steer Humanity towards Utopia and I Define utopia as high individual liberty high social mobility and high standard of living so in this case you can see where I give it a lot of context a lot of a lot of mission then I give it Frameworks or principles to use so again this is something that is that is directly in common with the NASA prompt is you give it context Mission uh principles or rules um and then finally I give it an interaction schema so this is a much more comprehensive interaction schema where I'm basically telling it like you're participating as an API and so this is your role so this is basically kind of defining the role as an API anyways so I hope you got a lot out of this so that you understand a little bit more how to build build these really gigantic comprehensive uh um system prompts so thanks for watching cheers like subscribe support me on patreon etc etc have a good one
