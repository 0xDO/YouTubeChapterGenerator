hey everybody David Shapiro here with a video uh today's video is autism 101 a crash course for the newly narrow spicy uh in other words the video that I wish that I had a year ago so a little bit about me before we get started uh here's my my creds um I Was A Gifted kid um I'm a systemizer uh I figured that out by taking the sqr test I'm HSP highly sensitive and I have a very high masking score from the cat queue test um my special interests are AI sci-fi and fantasy uh Mass Effect and Dragon Age are the best games ever um I've written three books on artificial intelligence and started a successful YouTube channel about it uh Jean-Luc Picard is the best and I watched the recent Dune uh like 38 times in two months so that's a little bit about me that's my autistic creds um let's move on to the video so first here is a table of contents so that you know what to expect and if you want to jump around feel free um part one how you got here uh some of the childhood experiences that you may have obviously I can't cover everything because everyone is unique and there's a huge variety some of the adult experiences and difficulties you might be facing that that could have brought you here as well part two is a brief history of autism starting from the early 20th century up to today part three is comorbidities and misdiagnosis basically the things that you might have been either misdiagnosed with or that you thought that you had then it turns out it might actually just be autism it can also be multiple things part four is a glossary of new terms for you such as masking and stimming and then part five is very short at the end which is next steps and I apologize that it's not on the table of contents I ran out of space but you should be able to see it in the uh in the video chapters so just be aware there is a part five okay so part one how did you get here what paths brought you here what are some things that uh that you might have experienced so first we'll talk about if you're having a bad day right now it's entirely possible that's why you got here then we'll talk about what your childhood might have been like um some of the examples again it's not exhaustive because there's so much variety here I can't cover everything I can only share my experience and the experiences that I'm familiar with from my friends and that I've read about um there are also probably some Clues along the way that you might have missed but I don't want you to feel bad about it because a lot of this information is new um then we'll talk finally we'll talk about difficulties you've probably faced in the past and are possibly facing now uh before we move on to part two so first if you're having a bad day um you uh a lot of people especially uh folks that realize as adults usually in their 30s or 40s such as myself we often figure this out figure this being that we're autistic because we go through something really bad like a major failed relationship social problems we lose a job sometimes all of the above all at once this is unfortunately uh very common I don't want to say Norma I probably shouldn't have said normal it's common for people like us um you might also be really confused angry hurt you might be doubtful and see like what's wrong with me this is unfortunately also very uh common for people like us now I want to have a really big caveat this video is not meant to give critical or life-saving life-saving advice not medical advice legal advice or anything like that this is just informational I'll be sharing my experiences my observations and and stories that I've heard so if you do if you are in really bad shape please find uh the help that you need again this is just an informational video okay so uh autistic childhoods very uh drastically um autism and neurodiversity varies from person to person very widely and so because of that there is no one-size-fits-all autistic childhood so while that might sound like a cop-out what I mean to say is that your unique experience if you don't see some of the stuff that's fine because it is different for everyone and that's part of learning is saying oh was this an autistic thing and I think there's a subreddit what's it called like autism decoded or something where it's like people can go ask like was this an autistic thing plus I have if you have uh once you develop some autistic friends we text each other all the time like is this an Autism thing um best conversations ever all right so anyways some of the more common things and again I don't want to say what's normal but here are some common things that uh present in autism so one is precocious and or intense interests so precocious if you're not familiar with that word means things that are you might be like too young for um so like you might have a precocious interest in politics or economics or um even uh sex or whatever we often kind of paradoxically grow up too fast but then we don't grow up enough um so your interest may be precocious or very intense such as you might develop collections of things or intense uh intellectual Curiosities and want to develop expertise um far before your age and if this isn't you that's fine there are plenty of of autistic people who don't again I don't want to say what is typical or normal just some common possibilities another one is sensitivity specifically hypersensitivity around sensory issues eating issues emotional issues that sort of thing basically the world is too intense for us and it can be easily overwhelming um another common possibility is hyperlexia so hyperlexia means a precocious ability to read some of us end up with very large vocabularies which again can lead to that kind of precociousness conversely we can also have verbal delays or social and emotional delays so it's weird because it can go either way we can either be super precocious or super delayed in all of these uh ways um we very frequently have difficulties at school sometimes we really love certain aspects of school like maybe the social aspect or the structure or specific classes but then we also have super like difficult aspects of school like once we get to a certain age School becomes really difficult or the social problems become unmanageable uh so these are also very common experiences for autistic people as they grow up usually teen hood is really hard uh like being a teenager is hard for everyone but especially from my own experience and watching other YouTubers it seems like adolescents can be particularly hard for us autistic people um there's numerous reasons I won't go into uh go try and unpack it in this video it that take that would take many many videos to fully unpack um and then the worst is uh we often uh are victims of neglect abuse uh abandonment or various kinds of trauma which we'll talk about about a little bit more later in the video um but the short version is because we have special needs if those needs aren't met um it can be we can have very traumatic childhoods even with uh like say for instance if we had neurotypical or low needs siblings who grew up fine um that child that same childhood experience might have still been traumatic for us um there's a researcher I can't remember his name off the top of my head but he wrote a paper or a book called um the Orchid and the dandelion and so he wrote about how some children are just far more sensitive than others and experiences that would not be traumatic to some children are traumatic to others and this is a really critical thing for us to understand and that's why I'm I'm spending more time on this is because we are special needs and we have different needs if those needs aren't met our childhood very well could have been traumatic even if it at first glance looks like it was an okay childhood so just keep that in mind um so what I will say is if you're at this point as you're learning you will probably realize that there were Clues along the way my fiance and I I'll have this like running joke where it's like how did it take us this long to figure out that we are uh not neurotypical um and the I don't want anyone to feel bad about this because a lot of this information is brand new and we'll get to that in a later slide but some of the clues that you might have had along the way were maybe test scores you might have tested really good or really bad for me it was kind of paradoxical uh I was in like I was regularly in the 99th percentile of all tests until it came to reading comprehension but the reason that I got bad scores on the essay tests was because I was unpacking it too much and I didn't know how to fully form my arguments and so people are like what the heck is Dave writing about this doesn't make any sense and it's because my understanding was too nuanced and too complex and I couldn't fully communicate it fortunately I did have an English teacher who told me one day she was like we're talking about um oh what was it it was one of the one of the books that we read I think it was a Canterbury Tales and I was unpacking like the nuances of the morality and she's like Dave you are talking over the heads of everyone in this class I know what you're going where you're saying but you're too advanced so shut up she didn't say it quite like that but point being is that um we can test really good or really bad again it's kind of this paradoxical like uh Spectrum we might have really odd friend groups we might be friends with the pariahs or the rejects or we might not have any friends or we might be friends with the the Nerds uh the chess club the computer club that sort of thing um so that can that can be a clue and again some of this is normal stuff just because you had these things doesn't necessarily automatically mean that you're autistic because there's plenty of neurotypicals who test well and are members of social groups right um but when so what you're looking for is a pattern and we'll get into patterns later uh so another thing is uh stimming and other behaviors um so like I was really annoying as a teenager I was loud I um I made obnoxious noises um and it turns out like oh I was just autistic because I didn't understand what was socially appropriate um so those kinds of things might have been Clues I learned to stop doing those because uh actually I remember it was one very specific incident where I like made an obnoxious noise and my cousin and my uncle were like Dave knock it off like stop doing that forever and I was like okay I'll stop um but like that was a behavior that I should have grown out of as a teenager but I hadn't um another thing that could be a clue is if you've had meltdowns shutdowns or periods of reclusivity and we'll go over those in Greater detail later if you have depression and anxiety and other things that can also be a clue that maybe you haven't fit in and that you've maybe not not not had your needs met and then there also might be you might have uh I don't want to say disorders but you might have struggles or issues around relationships and or sex and other forms of intimacy I should have said relationships and intimacy not just sex and I won't go too much into detail in that because that's a whole other can of worms that might be another video in the future so if you had any of these things and more again like I said I can't create an exhaustive list this is just like some of the common themes these might have been clues that you had growing up and if you didn't connect the dots until now don't feel bad about it I didn't until I was 36. um had to remember and it is actually really common for uh for those of us to kind of come to the game late in life so to speak um now that being said so we talked about childhood and developmental difficulties or problems that we may have had so let's talk about adult difficulties that you may have had or be having so one is work difficulties uh whether it's job loss or frequent job change if you can't handle the Daily Grind and it feels soul-crushing obviously everyone jokes about how you know like the nine to five is kind of tedious but for some of us it's actually not sustainable and then if you are constantly distant from your co-workers like that can be another clue um put it this way uh I usually got invited to the bar with my co-workers once I got invited to lunch with my co-workers once and then they realized like wow Dave's weird um but also I never really connected with my co-workers so that could be something that you've experienced where like I honestly just preferred to be by myself to eat eat on my own and so the pandemic and working from home Stellar for my career um and then I quit anyways I'll talk about that later relationship difficulties so if you are perpetually Alone um it's entirely possible that neurodiversity is part of the reason for that um if conversely you have many toxic or disastrous relationships autism could also be part of that and again so it's like this the spectrum of opposites that being said there are plenty of autistic people who do have good relationships but many of us have had some doozies we'll talk about that more later um and then social difficulties such as loneliness never fitting in never finding your tribe um bullying and rejection and just honestly feeling like an alien I remember many years ago I read um a book about Nikola Tesla that took excerpts from his Diaries and the dude honestly thought he was an alien because he realized that his perception of the world was so vastly different from the people around him he's like maybe I'm not actually human and that really resonated with me okay so let's talk about the two two of the likely scenarios not the only scenarios but two of the likely scenarios that brought you here today why are you watching this video so the first is the path of suck um maybe you had a relationship implode maybe you had a job implode uh something bad happened maybe you're really burned out that's how I figured out um that I was autistic it was I was just in the state of Perpetual burnout and I'm like what the heck is going on I had enough and I wanted answers and I finally just like I cast the widest net I talked to my friends I actually had I have a friend who worked with autistic children and so I was like I was having difficulties and I texted texted her and I was like am I autistic like like she would know and she had dropped hints like so here's an ethical thing like if you know that someone is autistic you can't just tell them until they're ready you have to wait for them to ask so she's like you might be go take this test so she was very helpful and very supportive um and that was that started me on this path of learning now you might also be here just because you're curious you might not be in a state of distress which if if that's true good I like I'm actually really happy for you that you found this information before it became bad um maybe you've taken some online tests maybe someone suggested it to you maybe you realize that your friends are Autistic or that your friends are weird and you're like hey maybe we're on the Spectrum uh maybe a TV character resonated with you uh the most recent one was Wednesday Adams from the Netflix version she is very heavily typed as uh as uh neuro spicy the line where she said uh like stop confusing me with your emotional Morse code or something like that the the aspie memes subreddit really liked that one um so but basically you know you might be doing okay but you want answers so if if either of these paths or another path brought you here just wanted to show that if if this resonates you're probably in the right place okay so now part two let's do a very brief history of autism the reason that I want to share this with you is because the context is actually really really helpful a lot of this information comes from the book neurotribes and other books which we'll talk about I'll give you some resources towards the end of the video but let's go over the history so that you understand that like this is all brand new stuff so first there is Hans Asperger who was a pediatrician in Vienna um and in 1946 he wrote a seminal paper about autistic psychopathy or autistic psychopathy uh which is not a very nice name um but he was doing the best that he could yes he worked with the Nazis and that is very controversial so basically take everything from Asperger's with a grain of salt but he did set the stage and he started the conversation he started defining what this is now one of the most enduring problems was that his original research focused only on boys and so because of that until very very recently boys have been diagnosed with autism disproportionately to girls and we are still dispelling myths about the fact that autism can present very differently in girls and women and and assigned female at Birth one of the key differences uh and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say this as a blanket statement but one of the most common differences is that autistic girls tend to be quieter um and so they're like they basically type as like oh you're just a sweet shy quiet girl and that's fine and so autistic girls are far more likely to be missed um that is again that is like a vast oversimplification there's plenty of other aspects but I'm not an autistic girl there's plenty of autistic uh women YouTubers out there who will help you if you are uh in that category and need more help um purple Ella and um Mom on the Spectrum are two of my favorite uh autistic women YouTubers um so fast forward into the 50s and 60s the development of ABA or applied behavioral analysis um is uh let's just say super problematic it focused on correcting the quote bad behavior of autism um forcibly through punishment or what they euphemistically called operant conditioning so basically if if there was a behavior that that your parents or family didn't like then you would be pretty much coerced into stopping those behaviors whether it was echolalia which is um which is verbally repeating things um or stimming or whatever else and so this is super problematic because it prioritizes the needs and experience of parents rather than the uh rather than the needs and react and emotions of the victim and I do say victim very deliberately many people who have gone through ABA consider themselves victims and say that it was a very traumatic experience um so like yeah it's bad unfortunately I've I had never even heard of it until um more recently as I was doing research uh but yeah like I have friends that are that are more uh Autistic or or my friend that has worked with autistic children and she's like ABA is pure evil um basically one of the things that it does is that it conditions uh victims to accept arbitrary punishment from strangers um and to also suppress their individual needs which makes them uh extremely vulnerable to abuse uh in other aspects in life and later in life um it is widely considered unethical and effective and problematic by many groups of people and yet it is still practice and continues to this day that being said there have been some strides to make it more Humane but in general uh the consensus uh is that ABA needs to go away there are some people that have gone through ABA that say it was fine but I think that they are in the minority um so fast forwarding through the uh 60s 70s 80s and 90s that was kind of like a a a winter a a Dark Age of of autism where it was kind of like it was only boys and only the most extreme cases were recognized um fast forward to the to the 90s and early 2000s and that's when the current um ASD Renaissance started happening so one of the one of the the uh one of the seminal um Moments One of the Hallmark moments was a Conference was held in Los Angeles in 2010 to go over autism it was basically to Workshop like what is what is this really and actually this this screenshot comes from a video where they were talking about this conference I don't know if the video was taken at the conference or if it was after the conference I think this video comes from 2014 where it was kind of like a postmortem of this conference so that conference led to the dsm-4 criteria being revised in 2011 and finally it was fully integrated into the DSM-5 in 2013. so this is only 10 years ago that the current criteria were even established and one thing to keep in mind is that it takes on average seven years for new medical standards to be fully disseminated and that's on average there's obviously a lingering uh thing so this is information that is still kind of being circulated and even in the this video which I've got it I've got it here revised DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder I definitely if if you're interested in learning about the history I definitely recommend that you watch this video like pretty much in its entirety um this speaker does a really good job of explaining how the diagnostic criteria was reassessed and also the fact that there are still some enormous gaps in it so keep in mind that even as of 2013 the DSM-5 even the experts say this is entirely inadequate for what autism is so even the experts know that the current definition is bad but it's better than it was so progress has been made but it's still pretty yikes so our contemporary understanding um is I just wanted to give a much more recent timeline so in 2015 autism from the inside channel was started in 2016 the purple Ella channel was started and 2016 neuro tribes the book that I mentioned earlier was published in 2018 Embrace autism website was founded in 2020 the pattern Seekers was published which the pattern Seekers it was a good book but it focuses on like the autistic superpower people like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison and and people like me who are really strong in like science and technology and completely ignores uh women so just keep in mind that the pattern Seekers is problematic but it still has some helpful information in 2021 mom on the Spectrum channel was started who that's this is her I adore her she is a trip I love listening to her explain things um and then finally in 2022 unmasking autism them by Devin Price was published and I think that this book unmasking autism is probably going to be considered the like the herald of like the new era of understanding uh autism and certainly all of these YouTubers have also contributed so I I want to really drive home the point that a lot of this information is brand new and it takes time for this information to be disseminated and understood and discussed so this is how we got this is this is the full history of how we got to where we are today of autism and you notice I've got my little stimming Cube so that I don't like rock and stuff okay so part three comorbidities and misdiagnoses um there are a lot of things that uh autism is often mistaked mistaken as uh mistaken um there are also some legitimate comorbidities now all that being said I have to put a huge asterisk on the list I cannot give you medical diagnosis I cannot um I cannot give you medical advice all I'm doing is presenting generalities from the web so these are observations from Twitter Reddit YouTube and um and also my friends uh so again take all of this with a grain of salt and keep in mind that these are just my personal opinions not medical advice not diagnosis etc etc okay so number one uh something that is very common is executive dysfunction so executive dysfunction is often called add or ADHD there are other kinds of Executives executive dysfunction but those are ADHD and add are the most common commonly understood models there's three primary uh symptoms of executive dysfunction so one is impulse control which is doing things that maybe you shouldn't have another is some kind of attention disorder whether it's lack of attention or hyper Focus organic you have this like polarity and then there's hyperactivity such as uh um manic episodes or hyper Focus or being super loud super energetic or states of high arousal that sort of thing so some common problems if you do have executive dysfunction not everyone does and and in fact this is one of the things that I I don't have that much anymore I think that I probably could have qualified as ADHD one day but I've learned to cope and compensate and I also sleep diet and other changes really help with this stuff but anyways some common problems that you might have if you do have Executives this function is difficulty reading or other long focused tasks anything that comes across as boring right if you cannot tolerate boredom or hypo arousal so the the the clinical term for this is hypoarousal which means under aroused if anything is not stimulating enough you can't do it that is a common uh symptom of executive dysfunction now that being said all of us have a certain level of arousal that is required for us to get by and that's what stimulant drugs like Adderall do is they actually make you feel more stimulated doing really boring things so they give you an artificial dose of of the neuro neurotransmitters that happen when you are sufficiently stimulated so there's hypoarousal which means you're under aroused and there's hyperarousal which means you're over stimulated we'll talk about that in a little bit when we talk about meltdowns another common problem with uh with executive dysfunction is most commonly interrupting people or other kinds of social problems like inappropriate behavior or inappropriate outbursts or topics of conversation that people find unacceptable we'll talk about that more later because usually once we get together like we are completely uncensored and it's great like you know I can text my autistic friends and be like so let's talk about masturbation and they're like okay cool let's talk about it um and if you have the right group of friends like there are no taboo topics and it's great um uh another one of the last common problems around executive dysfunction is that daily chores can be really bad and that goes back to that hypoarousal problem where doing dishes and laundry and cooking for yourself or even just checking email or whatever for me it's it's any mail doing taxes like car stuff oh my God I hate that stuff because it's so boring anyways so yeah maybe I do have some more ADHD now some common strengths of executive dysfunction is hyper focus and I say that this is a strength because if you learn to use it if you learn to turn it off and turn it on and learn what gets you hyper focused and how to get out of it it can be a freaking superpower um Devin Price talks about this in his book where because we often can work far faster than most people with one or two hours of work we get as much work done as many other people get in a day or two done so hyper Focus can be super valuable if you use it tactfully and you also can get out of it I have gone into hyper Focus for the longest stretch was I think 11 hours straight while I was revising a book I don't recommend doing that I was in bad shape after that now I limit myself to like two hours maximum um we can also have intense and Broad interests which means that we can be very well read and also very colorful and interesting people some of the weirdest coolest people that you meet are going to be those with ADHD and or other forms of neurodiversity um depending on the study you look at there is a comorbidity of 30 to 50 percent between Autism and um and executive dysfunction such as ADHD I don't really care about those studies because the methodology this that and the other like you have executive dysfunction or you don't we don't need to talk about Diagnostics here okay so a little bit less fun is attachment Disorder so attachment disorders can be very common with autism for a number of reasons so one is childhood mistreatment such as abuse or neglect and as I mentioned earlier you might have had what would be a more than sufficient a good enough upbringing for a for a neurotypical child but it might not have met your needs and if your needs are chronically unmet that counts as neglect which is a form of abuse which can result in anxious or insecure attachment and again it comes down to the fact that you just did not get your emotional needs met and so you might have emotional development differences this can also lead to uh it can it can this is kind of a chicken of the egg problem it can cause and also lead to social difficulties so it can be kind of a vicious cycle um but basically what what this amounts to is we end up in harmful toxic and codependent relationships um we we and I say we meaning neurodivergent or neurodiverse people we tend to be more vulnerable than average um and it's not that we're like especially gullible or anything but it's a combination of we don't have healthy relationship schemas we don't know what genuine attachment really feels like and so because of that we don't have a good model with which to approach relationships and so that makes us either vulnerable to people who deliberately pray on such people which is actually really rare what happens more often is that we just organically end up in relationships that are that are uh toxic and that that's not to excuse anyone you know because unfortunately like we have to take we have to learn to take care of ourselves um they said on the channel um uh Cinema therapy the Mantra was uh your mental health issues are not your fault but they are your responsibility and that sucks and autism is not your fault but it is your responsibility and that sucks right and so part of learning to deal with autism is learning about attachment disorder and working on it I actually have a book that I recommend it's called insecure and love which is written from a neurotypical perspective but it's a very helpful book if you want to learn about attachment schemas our relationship schemas and attachment disorders um so one thing that is interesting is that some of our relationships are actually really great and some of them are awful and Until you realize that autism is and vulnerability and disorder are like some of the ingredients it might confuse you as to like why some relationships are great and some are awful um like I'm still friends with a lot of my ex-girlfriends and I am absolutely not friends with some of them and I was like what's the pattern here and the pattern was the ones that I'm still friends with are are narrow spicy and uh the ones that I am not are disordered in other ways um so that's that uh personality disorders so personality and mood disorders are often misattributed or or rather autism is often misdiagnosed as a personality disorder and that is again because we are learning to recognize uh autism a little bit better but also that trauma that I talked about can result in symptoms that look like personality disorders so when we talk about meltdowns and shutdowns and attachment disorder these are all very commonly associated with personality disorders and you know you might say okay well autism is part of your personality therefore it's a personality disorder but I think it's actually really important to separate it out because the Genesis of these things can be very different whereas autism is largely environmental and genetic I think it's 70 genetic I'm not sure whereas personality disorders are often caused are often almost exclusively uh uh not genetic Environmental family abuse and Trauma and and things like that there are there are very few cases of like primary psychopathy and primary sociopathy which is someone is just genetically disordered um but personality disorders are very commonly created by deeply deeply dysfunctional families not always but often so but I still want to talk about um the the three cluster B personality disorders so that you understand like oh if I associate with that or if someone accuse me of that maybe it was a misattribution and you're actually autistic so histrionic personality disorder is primarily about people who is primarily about being the center of attention or attention-seeking behavior such as acting out in public or seeking sex and relationships um one of the aspects of histrionic disorder is highly capricious or Mercurial Mercurial emotions such as emotions that are really intense and often inappropriate given the situation borderline personality disorder is about instability it's about unstable emotions unstable sense of self and it is one of the biggest Hallmarks is really intense and tumultuous relationships now again I just talked about attachment disorder and the fact that we often end up in catastrophic relationships which might make you think that you could be borderline but it might also just be that you're a victim of a borderline or someone else with some other kind of disorder uh another aspect of borderline personality disorder is that it is associated with impulsive and self-destructive behavior um I remember a while ago I read that uh that 10 of all borderline lives end in suicide um which is like that's pretty crazy uh that is a very very high uh representation and then finally narcissistic personality disorder or narcissism is uh about a grandiosity which is paradoxically paired with vulnerability so there's What's called the there's the grandiose narcissist but there's also the vulnerable narcissist and this can manifest as a need for admiration which is basically another form of insecurity it's like hey I don't feel good about myself please reassure me and then uh fragility emotional fragility arrogance and a lack of empathy uh are also aspects of that now the lack of empathy thing is interesting because as autistic people we might not connect with with people or we might have a flat affect we might have things that from the outside appear to be lack of empathy or impulsivity or disordered relationships but it's actually just all autism so again I want to really have a big asterisk is I don't want to say like if you if you do have a personality disorder like there is help that you can get and I don't want to I don't want to like say like just throw a blanket over it like oh you're actually just autistic I'm not telling you that but what I am saying is that autism is often uh misattributed to these these disorders and I don't know what the comorbidity is um so in some circles they're called fleas which is like you might have some traits of disorders um but you might not have the disorder itself and that's called a flea which is like if you lie with dogs you get fleas and so it's like okay you might have had some bad stuff brush off on you from a toxic family or a toxic relationship so just wanted to throw that out there it's really complicated um and then finally one of the common threads for all of this is trauma anxiety and depression so chronic and or severe maltreatment is trauma that's what trauma is so this includes emotional neglect coercion abuse gaslighting manipulation and control and a Litany of other uh kinds of mistreatment trauma is often at the heart of anxiety and depression which can also result in ADHD attachment disorder and personality disorder trauma can happen at any time it's often different like what is traumatic to a child is often different to what's traumatic as a to an adult it can happen at work it can happen at home school pretty much anywhere and uh this topic is entirely too complex to fully unpack because it has to do with um with the way that your brain is wired and the way that it rewires I recently learned that chronic stress actually increases the size and sensitivity of the amygdala and I'm not going to go too deep into Neuroscience but basically the amygdala is what mediates anxiety and fear and a few other things but imagine that you know you have chronic stress due to being autistic and not getting the support that you need so you end up with a hypersensitive amygdala which keeps you up regulated and Hyper Vigilant at all times it's pretty awful so yeah I just wanted to point out and and one thing that I forgot to put on this slide is that uh trauma often has a vicious cycle with autism because trauma can make the symptoms of autism worse uh which and can then provoke more trauma so for instance if you had a difficult childhood you already have enough struggles which can cause you to struggle at work which can cause you to get into a toxic relationship and those can create even more trauma as an adult which makes everything even worse which is why at the beginning of the video I said that people often find their way to this in their 30s or 40s is because this vicious cycle has continued for too long and enough is enough that's not always the case but it is it is uh often enough the case that it's worth mentioning all right part four glossary of key terms so if you're new to autism if this is a night if this is a new idea to you there's a whole Litany of terms that you're probably going to find and that you um might might want to know about so first is masking so autistic masking is uh or it's also sometimes called camouflaging and this is the cat cue test that I mentioned earlier you can take that on Embrace autism so masking is uh it's a broad category there's three subcategories so first is masking which is hiding or suppressing any traits any autistic traits so that you can appear to be more neurotypical such as stimming verbal tics and special interests there's obviously plenty of other autistic traits that you might hide facial expressions so on and so forth so masking is just hiding it the second is compensation which is practicing social skills to make up for cognitive emotional or social differences I don't want to say deficits we'll talk about the disability model in a minute but for now we're just focusing on on on compensation for differences so this might be a matter of developing rules or templates or acting skills so um I actually had a story that I wanted to share about compensation when I finally quit my day job on my last day I had a I had a chat with my boss and you know he was he was very sad he wanted me to stay and one thing I told him I was like I am very different and he said no you're not and I said that's because I've been acting and he didn't know how to process that and he just he kind of he let it go he he understood what I meant and I was like I am not who you think I am I have been pretending to be normal this entire time for the last three years um and I was like and I'm done I'm done pretending I'm gonna be true to myself from now on um and the third category of masking is what's called assimilation which is more like making strategic decisions about uh where you live um and and where you work and how you live how you work your friend groups and other coping strategies so assimilation is more like planning compensation is more like practice and masking is more like hiding so these are things that you'll want to know I mentioned the book unmasking autism by Devin Price Cardinal work on this meltdowns so meltdowns are well as defined a meltdown is an intense and overwhelming emotional and behavioral response to a stressful or triggering situation typically characterized by Angry outbursts crying and or physical agitation so a meltdown is often labeled categorically as quote inappropriate behavior so this is why things like ABA have come up and this is also one reason for bullying and rejection in in neurotypical society is people can just say oh you're aggressive oh that's inappropriate behavior and they just use that as a as a justification to bully you which then makes it worse um it's sometimes it's also sometimes referred to as regressive behavior and so basically that's why I had a picture of a child is because meltdowns can sometimes look like a temper tantrum um but it's basically like you're overwhelmed so I talked earlier about the term hyper arousal so hypoarousal is when you're bored to tears hyperarousal is when you're over stimulated for uh too long um and then you enter into a state of distress or dysregulation and so it can be it can be caused by any number of any kind of distress whether it's loud noises or misophonia which is uh an inability to tolerate certain kinds of sounds regardless of volume it can be caused by temperature um if you're too hot or too cold for me I can't tolerate well it's weird I can tolerate high heat if I'm outside and walking but if I'm inside and I need to be relaxing like temperature like I can't handle high temperature um restrictive clothing or uncomfortable clothing that has a add texture that can cause distress crowds parties those kinds of things can also cause distress then there's internal Sensations if you become of your heartbeat or digestion or reflux or whatever nausea internal Sensations can also cause distress which can lead to a meltdown and there's overwhelm of any kind there's lots and lots of other videos some of the YouTubers that I mentioned earlier they have a lot of videos about meltdowns and how to cope with them again that is a huge topic the triggers vary and there's also there's also the concept of the window of tolerance so the window of tolerances how big is the window between hypoarousal and Hyper arousal and for some people your window is very narrow so for some people your window is narrow at all times where you have a very narrow band of comfort now there are things that can change your window of Tolerance such as quality of sleep that you've had if you've eaten well enough or if you've had too much coffee or have you eaten junk food or you're under a lot of stress lately or you're feeling lonely those are all things that can change your window of Tolerance and so there are sometimes that like oh wow like I wouldn't have been able to tolerate that I would have had a meltdown before um and and other times it's like you know you might be on a hair trigger fortunately um for myself I can say I have not had a meltdown in like many years um and that is because I've learned to take better care of myself physical health such as getting adequate exercise sleep and diet are for me have been absolutely critical in widening the window of Tolerance um so that is one thing shutdowns a shutdown is kind of the opposite of a meltdown so a meltdown is like an explosive response a shutdown is an implosion uh implosion response where basically instead of instead of becoming more energetic you become less energetic and so you enter into a state of excessive fatigue which is often associated with cognitive impairment such as memory lapses loss of vocabulary this is one of the weirdest things um and if you've watched my videos on my other channel you'll notice that sometimes it's like I can't remember a word there's a few words that I can't recall right now so this is all these these are all under the category of loss of function so you might lose the ability to plan to think ahead to do anything other other than just like become a reptile and go to sleep right there's other kinds of responses during shutdowns such as mutism um not or otherwise non-verbal periods or other verbal difficulties where you can't express yourself you might also lose prosity so prosody is the ability to change your tone and inflection to convey emotion but sometimes you will speak very very flatly if you um if you are experiencing a shutdown and that is and some some autistic people speak without porosity at all times it's not always true that's one of the myths that that needs to be dispelled is it just because you're autistic doesn't mean that you have a robotic affect um anyways that's a whole other topic and then finally you know withdrawal and collapse is kind of the quintessential shutdown it's where it's like okay I need to go be by myself for like a week um that is a coincidental shutdown uh stimming so stimming is a term that you'll probably hear which uh is a much more friendly term than the clinical self-stimulating Behavior everyone stems it's just a matter of how when and why so a better way of looking at slimming is it's doing something because it's soothing and feels good um so fidgeting flapping rocking that sort of stuff you might notice that sometimes I like you know rock in the chair I also have my my Cube so that I can be doing something with my hands if you watch my other videos sometimes maybe you don't see it because my hands are down here but I'll I'll sometimes rub my knuckles as I'm talking and again that's just it's creating a sensation that is pleasant and soothing um other times rolling around on the floor can feel really good uh there is a um there's actually some therapies uh uh around that again I can't remember what it's called right now um I'll tell you later if I remember um but rolling flapping um touching and petting yourself so again like you know rubbing my Knuckles um I also will sometimes you'll see me like kind of like pet my head it looks like a thinking thing but it's actually a stimming behavior it's like oh that kind of feels good um actually that does feel really good right now sorry um it can feel compulsive so here's why here's one of the reasons why ABA is so bad is because Aba explicitly and deliberately punishes stemming because it is a quote aberrant behavior for no reason there's nothing medically wrong with stimming it's just that it is considered socially unacceptable and so ABA wants to stamp out stimming sometimes like with like Simi like somewhat violent punishments um and the thing is is with a compulsion if you don't do it it gets worse right like I can force myself to sit here and not fidget but I'm I will then be expending additional cognitive energy fighting that compulsion where I could just do the stimming behavior and then I don't have to think about it right um and I did forget to mention in the comorbidities about OCD so many people that are autistic uh first think that they're HSP and OCD and a Litany of other things and uh and my friend is like yeah that's basically all just autism um uh again it can be dangerous to throw categorical blankets over things but holy mackerel like once you understand autism it's like that does explain a lot um stimming is often seen as socially unacceptable which is problematic so for instance like if you feel really tight sometimes I'll stretch in public and I know that like some people are like what are you doing like stretching feels good bro like just do it like it doesn't hurt anybody um and then co-stemming is exceptionally weird so co-stemming is if you have a friend or a partner that um that like you kind of interact with each other and that is like that's really weird to do in public but it's also really fun like my fiance and I will be like hanging out and then like I'll just be like petting her arm and she's like are you stimming with my arm and I'm like oh yeah I am sorry um anyways so stimming is a thing sensory processing issues so there's sensory stuff uh whether it is misophonia I mentioned that earlier taste and texture aversions so many autistic children are very picky eaters and that is because most things just feel gross to them um you know I've seen children that if they eat something that it has the wrong texture they'll throw up um and it's it and it has to do with um I think that it has to do with like maybe synesthesia where like a physical sensation triggers another Sensation that is not directly appropriate um like tinnitus which is something that I have I consider tinnitus to be another kind of sensory processing issue tinnitus in my case is because there's neural signals leaking from other parts of my brain into the audio auditory processing complex or whatever um and so a little bit more about the the neurology the Neuroscience of autism is that sometimes uh depending depending on the genetic profile you might have more or fewer distal Connections in the brain than a neurotypical person does I think I'm on the side that I have more distal connections which gives me like stronger sense of intuition but it can also create sensory processing issues because sometimes signals end up in places that they're not supposed to be um but then the then another kind of autism where you know people kind of can't connect the dots that is where I suspect again I can't this is just my pet Theory but I suspect that that is when there is a insufficient number of distal Connections in the brain meaning that you can't quite connect the dots um but anyways point being sensory processing issues of all kinds regardless of what the neurogenesis of it is that's a that's a thing um claustrophobia and restrictive and and the inability to tolerate restrictive clothing or clothing with bad textures you might notice that I wear this sweater all the time because it is very comfortable and very loose and inoffensive uh this is one of my favorite articles of clothing um digestive issues so one of the things that has become obvious lately is that there is a strong link between the gut and the brain so it's called the gut brain axis the micro the microbiome of the gut has a very strong impact of the brain and this seems like it is pronounced in autism it could also be causative so what I'll say for myself is when I improved my diet and I started taking probiotics my brain cleared up a lot so there's probably some inflammation signals that go back and forth not really sure there's a lot of research out there there's not really a conclusive thing like oh if you have autism you need lactobacillus etc etc for me it helped no promises if it'll help you um you might also uh have trouble with touch and hugging um or you might not again some of this it varies widely I don't like touching or hugging people that I'm not very close to um you know I hug my fiance and a few other people but otherwise it's just like No don't touch me um temperature intolerance once I mentioned earlier particularly heat or cold depends on the person pain sensitivity so this was uh there's another paper that came out recently I saw it on Neuroscience daily where it was it the the new conclusion is that autistic people are actually more sensitive to pain that we're not actually indifferent to pain which I don't even know where that myth came from but there's a myth out there that autistic people are indifferent to pain and my take is we're just used to pain everything hurts every day so we just learn to ignore it and live with it and actually learning to deminimize pain was really critical in my journey of self-acceptance when I started learning to recognize the muscle tension and pain that I had everywhere in my body I would literally wake up like in agony and I had to go do yoga in order to get the pain out and now that I have a lower stress lifestyle I don't have nearly as much pain every day but your relationship with pain could be very weird uh if you if you are um if you are on the Spectrum um there's probably a lot more stuff around sensory processing that I'm forgetting but obviously there's a lot here um same Foods uh so we have we uh we have same foods and same clothes and we have favorites we pick favorites of things right I have my Dragon Age Inquisition mug that I use like all the time um I use it for tea I use it for coffee I try not to use it for juice it's weird for juice because it's like you you don't want to drink juice and coffee out of the same thing anyways so we often have very well developed preferences um some sometimes these preferences are around foods that just don't make us feel bad because we have digestive issues because our guts are particularly sensitive we will gravitate towards the foods that don't hurt us and so you know I've seen children that either that I either knew were on the Spectrum or at least had clearly had some autistic traits and I noticed that they're very picky eaters and part of the reason is that they don't want to eat is because eating makes them feel bad it just hurts right again like our relationship with our bodies and pain is very strange and I think some of it can be it can definitely be fixed by the right dietary choices and the right supplementation at least again for me it really helped um we often enjoy the same games movies TV shows Sports Hobbies whatever we can be obsessive about some of these things to the point that other people get tired of it ask me about the time that I wanted to play Settlers of Catan every day until everyone was like Dave we're done with Settlers of Catan um also ask my fiance about how many times I watched Dune um so uh we we might also cycle through these and we'll talk more about that in when we talk about special interests in a minute um we develop routines rituals and patterns basically we like to come up with rules and this is because predictability and stability are really important to us um we we broadly some of us can handle and improvise but in general we don't handle change very well even if it's positive change sometimes it's like if something is different and new it can be exciting but can also be very stressful um you know moving getting a new car getting a new job new relationships any big life change can be extra stressful for us and so we prefer uh stability and that can also make us seem controlling and uh you know when you talk to other uh autistic people you'll realize we all are controlling in the same ways and it doesn't bother us but we often need control that neurotypicals don't understand and so to them it seems weird um and this this is actually a big source of conflict um between neurotypicals and neurodivergent people um but yeah so like I've got you know like my favorite sweater I've got like favorite blanket I've got my favorite mug whatever so we like we like to pick favorites um same Foods same things that sort of stuff foreign ableism and disability so this is a super controversial topic and I will try and navigate it as uh as carefully as I can um but so the the core question is are we different or are we disabled and so we might say neurodivergent or neurodiversity or you might look at it through the disability model so Devin Price in unmasking autism says unequivocally that that autism and neurodiversity is a disability by sheer virtue of the fact that the world is not meant for us that we have to adapt to the world and that and that our needs even no matter how mundane they are are considered special accommodations which we often don't get so from that perspective any kind of neurodiversity whether or not you can get by on your own is a disability that's Devin's opinion I think there's some Merit to it I don't fully agree with it then there's the diversity mindset which is really we're just different but if you put us together like you know you have two people with similar kinds of neurodiversity we usually get along really well and then any any feeling of disability disappears um so you could look at it from the disability perspective or the diversity perspective as with all things there's a lot of nuance and subtlety and I'm not going to say it's still we're in the middle because it's something else right now another way to look at this is from a medical perspective so the the DSM-5 defines three levels of support requirements so there's level one two and three I'm not going to get into the details but the point is is that from a from a medicalization perspective or a public health policy perspective ASD is a disability it's just a matter of how severe right so again there's Nuance to it um now from a social perspective there is often a lot of divisiveness between High needs and low needs people and family members of high needs versus loanies because I am a very low needs person I am intelligent enough and oriented enough and and capable enough to adapt and support myself and take care of myself and have generally healthy relationships now that sort of stuff so that gives me a lot of privilege which means that I basically have a fundamentally different experience from the friends families and sufferers of higher needs level two and level three needs people their experience of life is fundamentally different from mine and so that's this is a big reason that there is a uh a divide is because it's like we're basically in entirely different camps our experiences are fundamentally different which um again like like I said I want to try and navigate this as delicately as I can because it's not so black and white and I think that I think that this field is going to continue to proliferate and specialize and more information will become uh publicly available special interests so special interest I already talked about this a couple times these are obsessions or fixations that you might have things that we just love so much um sometimes our special interests are fixed for life I picked an image of Chess because chess is one of the quintessential things that uh someone might just be a die-hard competitive chess player their entire life um sometimes our special interests are transient which means that they they might change over time and we Master something and then move on and then Master the next thing and then move on sometimes our special interests are also cyclical we come back to them over time so those are the three kinds of orientations um that we excuse me can have towards special interests some examples include collections or categories so like stamp collecting is kind of the uh the the the tongue-in-cheek one um but you know uh collecting music collecting movies uh collecting anime Comics those kinds of things that we really uh enjoy um collecting parts or toys or whatever um those are those are very uh common kinds of special interests reading researching and intellectual Pursuits another very common kind of special interest um so if there's if like you learn about a new topic and you're like I'm going to become an expert on Egypt that is a special interest um for me my intellectual special interest is artificial intelligence and everything around it including the philosophy ethics and implementation and so on um and then another type of special interest are going to be activities Hobbies games that sort of stuff um you can have like hiking as a special interest or canoeing as a special interest or rock climbing I actually knew a couple some friends they moved away so I don't talk to them anymore but they were like rock climbing special interest people they watched documentaries about rock climbing they talked about rock climbing they had rock climbing periodicals they practiced it and I was just like wow you guys do everything about rock climbing it's you eat sleep and breathe rock climbing it's so that is that is another example of like a physical special interest special interests are sometimes shunned or punished or discouraged by families or Society um and it's in some cases it's because there's no immediate financial value to a special interest like unless you're going to do something competitively and win competitions and make money you're kind of discouraged from doing it especially in America because you know it's the pursuit of the almighty dollar comes first so unless your special interest has to be something that happens to be something that is lucrative also you're often discouraged or dissuaded from doing it um and so by repeatedly getting having your passions devalued eventually you give up in exchange to just make money um I am very lucky and grateful that I was able to Parlay one of my special interests into a new career so that's that uh neurotypicals so you might have heard me use the term neurotypical a few times now there is a shorthand for that it's called tippies um the the word Tippy is somewhat pejorative um it kind of creates an US versus them mentality uh because we have been ostracized or or rejected and so it's kind of a way of categorically labeling someone else's like actually maybe you're the problem um so but anyways neurotypicals are people that are closer to the average than us um there is a phenomenal quote that I had from an internet friend like 15 years ago I can't remember this guy's name but his mom worked with autistic uh I think autistic teens or autistic young adults and she said everyone has autistic traits it's just a matter of how many and how severe so basically congratulations everyone is on the Spectrum it's just a matter of where on the Spectrum there are no tippies anymore um no anyways in all seriousness um it's a matter of like you know there's a kind of a threshold right are you neurotypical enough to pass um or do you believe that you're neurotypical some people still identify as neurotypical even though they're not um and then we have another term that's coming up we call the tysm which I think is just hilarious like I've got the Chisholm so anyways I wanted to bring this up because again it is kind of becoming an Us Versus Them thing um where you know it's like uh the neurotypical is typical typical neurotypical or you know typical autistic person or whatever and so there's you know autistic versus the tippies um I wanted to I wanted to to point this out like it is what it is I'm not saying if it's good or bad I'm just making some observations that there is this sort of other ring that's happening and again like I understand that as a reaction because we have been othered we have been alienated from our own interests from our own true natures and that sucks and it doesn't feel Fair um so just be careful with this um and then finally part five next steps again this the whole point of this is a crash course giving you a bunch of information about autism if you happen to be on the Spectrum or think that you are so the overview is read a bunch of books if you can um there's not always books or you might not have the ability to read books that's fine there's audio books if you can do that watch a ton of videos there's a slew of videos on YouTube uh connect with others and I'll tell you a little bit about that and then finally make substantive changes in your life so let's unpack this first learn everything you can if you found this video and you clicked on it it's probably because you're in the information gathering phase so there's books that I mentioned a few already there's YouTube videos there's Reddit there's other social media groups you can find new friends you probably actually know someone who is on the Spectrum or can help you find friends that are on the Spectrum so having having friends that you can talk to is invaluable like someone that can like be your guide like ah welcome to the club um invaluable uh Meetup meetup.com can also be really good not not specifically finding autistic groups but finding special interest groups so my fiance and I met at our sci-fi writing group um hey special interest right so just so happens that you know if you go if you share special interests with people you might also share other things with them and it could be neurodiversity it could just be something else but anyways Meetup can be a great way to indulge in your special interests and find people who are like you new friends and new hobbies um so connecting with people who get you is really important as I mentioned earlier until more recently in my life I hadn't really connected with anyone that I felt like I truly understood and that truly understood me and 36 well I guess it was 33 34. that's a long time to go without having like too many genuine connections and that being said I do have a few friends that now that I now that I have the lens of like oh I'm on the Spectrum now I understand our friendship better so I'm not saying that like I had no friends until I was 33 it's that radical self-acceptance and self-learning really helped me understand how I connect to people and um and and and how they connect to me and ultimately to deepen those relationships and find new ones um another part of self-learning is letting go of those myths and letting go of bad habits and bad beliefs so for instance like you know I allow myself to just play with my stem Cube as I need to I'll be sitting on Zoom meetings like fidgeting with this like under the desk and it's like you don't know that I'm autistic fool you um uh yeah so getting rid of the shame and the guilt especially over like one thing that that I had and I think I watched videos talking about this where there's often a lot of shame or guilt over meltdowns because it's like why did I have this Behavior where normally I am a mature like competent adult and then I had a temper tantrum like I'm not like that I'm not a kid but then it's like oh I'm autistic and I was super overwhelmed and I was not being treated fairly so I had a meltdown oh that's not really my fault I'm doing the best that I can and then you just distance yourself from people like that um sometimes you have to let relationships go so this is one of those this is one of the more substantive changes that I mentioned and also banishing toxic people from your life I'm a big fan of blocking people like if I realize that someone does not have my best interests in mind or that someone is trying to exploit me in any way block I block them on LinkedIn I block them on Twitter I block them on YouTube and it's just like that is a self-protective measure and it's like you give me the bad vibes I I learned to trust my gut instinct and I also first learned to develop a gut instinct because one problem as an autistic person is I didn't have gut instinct about people um which is another reason that we like can be super vulnerable um and then finally like revisit the stuff about yourself that you suppressed right like learn who you really are what you really care about and and do that stuff so like for the longest time I just thought that AI was just going to be like the special interest that I had on the side but then I was like you know what I'm done pretending like this is something I really care about I'm gonna do this um and then same with sci-fi I'm writing a novel I don't know if I'll ever make any money on it but I really care about it and I enjoy doing it other life changes so I I want to I've had a lot of caveats in this video I want to had a caveat that these are not recommendations that I'm not telling you what to do these are just possible options some stuff that that I have done and that other people have done that helped them so one changing or quitting jobs um I recently quit my day job I will never go back to an office job or a corporate job I say that as someone who's starting a startup but I'm like I'm like the absentee CEO right like I I'm The Man Behind the curtains I just run stuff from the Shadows you know via email via slack via Zoom meetings like that's how I run things and that works for me um remote work excellent flexible hours excellent that's how you do things um many autistic people end up unemployed so on a more serious note this comes from uh Devin Price's book unmasking autism many autistic people end up unemployed because we cannot handle ordinary jobs if it was not for the pandemic I would have been in that category the pandemic was the only thing that saved my career and that was because I finally had the protected space to take a nap if I needed to to read a book if I needed to to disconnect from work and get out of the office so for anyone who says we need to get back to the office like keep in mind that some people actually need the work from home change relationships I mentioned this already end toxic relationships and find healthier people whether it's romantic relationships friendships or others right like protect yourself at all costs I'm giving you permission to banish people that are bad for you let go of shoulds let go of patterns that don't fit change your laundry sleeping and eating habits as needed all of my clothes are in like little basic drawers now and I also keep most of my clothes in the dirty laundry basket so it's like like I I empty the dirty laundry basket it's a nice clean plastic basket I wash the clothes and then usually my clean clothes stay in that basket until eventually I get around to putting them away but they're clean um and so Devin Price calls this building and autistic life for yourself definitely recommend that it takes a while it's taken me about a year to get to where I'm at now of just making little changes here and there around what I eat when I eat how I do chores how I do errands for me the list the checklist is perfect because there is nothing quite so satisfying as one having a system and two Crossing things off the list definitely recommend also if you want a book on checklist checklist Manifesto perfect book okay anyways finally dress and act in a way that's natural to yourself unmask if you can this is a very controversial topic not everyone has the privilege to unmask um I have some demographics about me that give me a little bit more privilege um and I also have skills and expertise that basically if I'm if you're a dude in Tech it's kind of expected that you're autistic um and so it's a little bit more tolerated that you're going to be quirky or weird so that's what I mean by like demographics and like and privilege that allows me to unmask and since I'm an expert in AI it's like oh well we just expect you to be weird like you know I'm the next Nikola Tesla or whatever um but if you can be as weird as you want dress differently pick up those different Hobbies be weird in public just don't hurt anybody right and making these Life Changes especially changes in in the privacy of your own home um that is like that is quintessential for building an autistic life for yourself okay we're almost at the end so for a quick recap autism has recently progressed a lot we're going through a Renaissance just in the last couple years there's a lot of great new information out there we still have a long ways to go because calling it The autism spectrum disorder implying that it's a single Spectrum no it's like 20 different dimensions there are so many kinds of neurodiversity that like it cannot it can't be thrown into a single category but that's all we got right now autism is still very deeply misunderstood um whether it's myths that persist out there stigma against it a stigma against Autism is a big reason that a lot of people who could benefit from this information still reject it they're like I don't want to associate with that I'm going to keep pretending like I'm neurotypical I will say for myself letting go of the illusion that I was neurotypical best life choice so far I'm still getting used to it and that's why I finally after a year made this video many controversies abound namely the disability conversation that is probably the biggest controversy around autism followed closely by ABA therapy and other other attitudes towards it like does autism need to be cured or not that is another hot button issue I didn't even mention that earlier there's a there's a school of thought that autism needs to be cured and there's a school of thought that autism doesn't need to be cured that it should should be allowed to exist I honestly don't know there are some days that I wish that I could take a pill and just be neurotypical there are other days that I'm like you know what I'm doing all right um so again it's currently undergoing a Renaissance a lot of these problems will be discussed and I don't know if they'll be solved but at least we'll have more information soon there's tons of resources all over so thanks for watching and I really hope this helped like I said the point of this video was this is the video I wish I had a year ago so help hope it helped thanks for watching
