so I had this idea the other day um as someone who's neuros spicy and you know ADHD or whatever I needed a way to like really systematically organize my time and so what I came up with was well I didn't come up with it I I borrowed it I regurgitated it is what's called the Moscow system so it's an acronym that means Ms CW or must should could and won't and it's typically used for project management so if you're trying to work on a project and you're trying to decide on you know what features does this project what must it have what should it have but what I realized was that this is actually really great for like a day-to-day management tool for those of us that have uh that have hyperfocus or uh pathological demand avoidance cuz those are somewhat like seemingly paradoxical uh ideas but you know hey neuros spicy we're uh we're a little bit off the off the beaten path so mscw must do should do could do won't do so this is a system that I uh was kind of unconsciously using and now I'm now I consciously use it and so the idea is you break things down into into a few categories and it's just it makes it super easy to prioritize and like you can do it on Evernote or Trello or even just pen and paper if you want to and so on a daily basis I will just appraise like okay Moscow what must I do today and I'll do all of those first if I can and then what should I do so you you might say okay well what's the definition of these because what one person thinks they must do is something might be different from what they should do or could do so here's the definitions that I use must do is something that is absolutely necessary and if you don't do it there are serious consequences like eating and sleeping and drinking water uh those are things that you must do uh and so for those of us that are neuros spicy putting spelling those out is sometimes necessary you know but there's other things that you might say are necessary to do that there are serious consequences like if you don't pay the electrical bill today the power will get shut off so that's a necessary that's a Musto or if there's a medication that you need to refill and if you don't get it you know life gets worse that's something that you must do today now if something can be put off but it you probably should do it then that's a should do and so that could be everything from go grocery shopping like I should go grocery shopping but if you don't you know either the consequences are mild or or they're delayed and so something that you should do is like there is there is a strong benefit to doing it but it's not absolutely necessary the world won't stop if you don't do it and so this is where like this is what I'm thinking of when I say like well there's some debate because you might say well I have to go to work today I must go to work today um is that actually true because it might not be true you should go to work you know you if if you're expected at the office you should go but it's not absolutely mandatory because the world unless you're like unless you're the president of the United States the world won't stop if you don't go to work you know they'll live without you and so like personally I I kind of I categorize work as I should do um now I'm also like self-employed so like I set my own schedule um which is actually partly why I needed this is because it's like wow if you categorize everything as like top priority as everything is must do then nothing is actually higher priority so then it's like okay well I'm recording this video right now because it's something that I should do I should record content because that's what my livelihood is dependent upon and then could do so the definition that I use of could do is something that may or may not have benefit but also has no consequences if you don't do it so the kind of the two Dimensions that I pay attention to are um like how necessary is it like is it is it mandatory or not is there benefit or not or are there consequences so I guess the way that I look at it is benefits versus consequences if something is necessary then that means the consequences are High um the benefits might also be there but really it's like the things that are necessary have high consequences the things that you should do um might have good benefits might have mild consequences the things that you could do likely have benefits but no consequences and then the things that you won't do are the things that either have no urgency um or are actively harmful like let's say that you know you got a lot of exercise yesterday cuz this is something that I struggle with sometimes I got a lot of exercise yesterday and so then I won't get more exercise today because like my body needs time to recover um so and so that's like you know should uh must do so absolutely necessary uh should do which is uh you know beneficial could do which is like yeah you know give her take it or leave it and that can include fun things too like I could go play some video games I could go to a movie I could go out you know drinking with friends um but the world won't stop if I don't do it and the you know there may or may may not be benefits to it and then things that I won't do like I won't you know jump in River cuz it's really cold and that would be awful right now so yeah I hope this I hope this framework helps you uh yeah and I like I said I use it uh and it's easy to remember Moscow mscw Moscow so thanks for watching cheers so on the topic of ADHD I was just reflecting on the fact that I have all but stopped playing video games since I finished cyberpunk 2077 and have been recovering from burnout and I just said out loud to myself I would rather walk in silence than play video games and the reason that I think that's significant is because that says something about the biochemical reward signals that I'm getting and it's like here's why this is wild for me is because video games are literally designed to periodically give you that dopamine hit where you know you you have like an intense fight or you know a cool like a hot romance scene or you know some cool dialogue or whatever right but as I'm spending less time in front of the computer still way too much but less time in front of the computer and more time out here that intense reward cycle is actually less rewarding cuz I've got all the like not all the time in the world but I've got enough time that I can go for a 4H hour a walk every day or I could play video games and I choose to go for a walk and it's not a conscious Choice it's just that's what I would rather do so I I don't know like I've seen mixed mixed results like online lots of people talk about like dopamine fasting and getting away from video games and then I've seen a few scientific papers that say that there's nothing too dopamine fasting and I don't know if it's dopamine fasting or maybe it's just like reprogramming again getting getting dopamine from another source but like the reason this is all Salient is because as someone with ADHD I'm someone who needs a lot of exercise like I tell people that I'm kind of like a border collie or a racehorse like you got to run me or I'll get bored and start chewing myself or kicking I don't actually kick people or chew myself but point point is is that uh like some animals some animals are bred to move and I think that I'm just genetic Ally predisposed to needing to move and so I'm getting I'm getting my dopamine this way from nature and sunlight and walking but yeah it's weird it was just suddenly dawned on me I would rather go for a walk then play video games and I've tried I played Starfield for about 3 hours and then I was like me it's not stimulating enough I played outer worlds for about 2 hours meh not stimulating enough so anyways that's my thought
