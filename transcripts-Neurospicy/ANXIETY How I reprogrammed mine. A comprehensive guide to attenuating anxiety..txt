I have read over 30 books on Mental Health ranging from topics to anxiety depression PTSD relationship disorders personality disorders and abuse and so today's video is a distillation of everything that I have learned about anxiety now there are many videos out there that will promise to cure your anxiety or one neat trick that will get rid of it um but one that's all clickbait and two uh what I'm going to promise with this video is that by by the end you will understand enough about the neurophysiology and treatment of anxiety to reprogram your anxiety now obviously the there this does come with a medical disclaimer which we'll do in just a second but I wanted to get that in before we proceed so here's the medical disclaimer this is not intended to serve as medical advice or health education this is my personal opinions based on my personal experience I'm not a doctor therapist psychologist or psychiatrist uh take this all with a grain of salt as well it's from my unique perspective Ive this is what worked for me this is based on my personal Journey oh sorry hang on this is based on my personal journey and uh yeah so either either way I hope it's helpful all right so before we get into the rest of the video here's the agenda so you kind of know what to expect first I'll go over the references the top references the top books that I read that speak to this video um so you know what I'm not just making it up uh number two we'll unpack the neurophysiology of anxiety this is what's going on in your brain and body and then finally number three we will talk about how to attenuate your anxiety or reprogram it okay so first up is references so these are the top three books that I read in the course of understanding anxiety depression trauma and so on so first up is the body keeps the score this is kind of the Cardinal work that really established that uh trauma is a full body response yes it happens in the brain but it is also stored in the body as well this is really important to understand when you learn about processing and releasing trauma and Trauma is the underpinning thing behind depression anxiety and a lot of other issues uh next up is complex PTSD so cptsd is having a day it's having a moment um people are aware that uh you don't need to have just one single traumatic event in your life in order to be traumatized um it can be lowgrade trauma everything from mild emotional neglect and abandonment to uh chronic insults and and just feeling unsafe or or degraded or shamed for long periods of time so complex PTSD by Pete Walker really put that on the map um and of course as I mentioned trauma and PTSD uh figure greatly into anxiety and depression and then finally the best single book that I read on anxiety is rewire your anxious brain which uh this is actually kind of where the bulk of the treatment side of this video comes from there's a couple of honorable mentions so one is better Small Talk by Patrick King this one uh taught a couple lessons on the social anxiety aspect and then how to be yourself was also it it helped a little bit but not quite as much as some of these other ones so with all that being said let's get right into the neurophysiology of anxiety so the first thing that you need to know about anxiety is that it is an evolutionary trait it is there on purpose anxiety is a natural and healthy response to threats so whether it's a physical threat or emotional threat or whatever but the point is that it triggers a fight ORF flight response it is about preserving the body of whoever is experiencing the anxiety and it is meant to make you Vigilant alert and prepared for survival uh now another thing is that and we'll get a little bit more into this is that it is also learned uh now because there is a large variance in how sensitive people are uh some people learn to be anxious much more easily than than others and when I say learned it's not something that you study uh what I mean is that you might be physiologically primed to become anxious um in situations that other people might not be and this is just natural variation so the whole point of this slide is that uh anxiety is natural and it is healthy but it can be taken to pathological levels where it is persistent and unpleasant and it actually degrades your quality of life the next part that you need to know is the amydala so the amydala it's about the size of the of your pinky finger or maybe your index finger um and there's two of them there's one uh on each side of your brain uh just a few inches behind your eyes the amydala is a primitive structure it does not exist in the you know the big dome part of the brain that you see here it exists in the midbrain so basically it is not in the region of the brain that is responsible for conscious thought it is it is uh an older structure that is that has to do with more what you might consider unconscious thought uh now there are two ways that the amydala can be activated the first is through cognition or thought so this is this is like when you are thinking about something like you're worrying about work tomorrow or your you know in-laws coming to town or whatever you can literally think yourself into anxiety the other way is that it can be activated through senses and so because because of this there are two distinct uh like modalities for treatment uh of anxiety for mitigation of anxiety which all centers around reprogramming the amydala because no matter what else is going on uh anxiety is activated through the amydala uh this is because the amydala is is responsible for many things but another thing that you need to know is that because the amydala is a more primitive structure it's an older structure it actually receives information from your five senses before your conscious brain does so this is how you're able to react to Danger before you're consciously aware of it that's literally the pathway uh sights sounds things that you hear there's a special route that that information goes straight to the amydala before it goes to the rest of your brain so you can literally respond to Danger before it that information has even entered your conscious brain so I have a story about this um I was at the river uh about a year and a half ago and there was a log uh Laying across a few rocks and it was a big log um there's there had been a storm recently and the the log had had washed up on rocks and it was kind of precariously perched and so I was just kicking the log just you know see what would happen um but it got dislodged and it rolled towards me and this when I say log this was you know a good 2 and 1/2 ft across probably weighed several thousand pounds and it's rolling towards me down a rock this was not my brightest move before I consciously knew what was happening I had jumped off that rock onto another one and landed and broke my pinky um fortunately the log stopped rolling very quickly but the point is is that the amydala hijacked my entire body sarabellum brain stem everything down and launched me to safety without even thinking about it um I was I was vaguely conscious of what was going on at the time you know it's just like I kind of received a report from from lower down saying like sir we're about to launch brace for impact um and then I was on the Rock and my hand was hurting and we walked home and you know my handed swollen up and you know a trip to the doctor later um it looked like the kind of injury that you get from a fist fight and so I actually had them saying like who did you beat up and I'm like you should see the other guy it's a log and they they didn't find that funny anyways point being is that the amydala will react to things that you are not conscious of and so there are plenty of stories out there um if you go to Reddit and I've I've been struggling with anxiety since before Reddit um but I remember reading a story many years ago about someone who was at the doctor's office and their heart rate was like 120 and their blood pressure was through the roof and they felt fine and so this is another thing about the fact that it is preconscious is that you can be experiencing physiological anxiety without being consciously aware of it uh and so one of the key ways to identify it is with this is my Fitbit and so sometimes if my heart rate is you know 90 or 100 I'll be like hm I'm clearly having a physiological reaction I don't feel the anxiety but it's there um and so this is another key thing that we'll talk about which is learning to identify the anxiety because if you don't identify it then uh it's difficult to treat okay so uh that is the very high Lev tldr about amygdala now the other part about the amydala that you need to know is that it has a memory of its own as a neural structure it has the ability to recognize patterns it recognizes patterns of thought and it recognizes patterns of Sensations this is how it is able to uh know when to hijack the rest of your body and activate that flight or fight response so in the in my case um where you know I've been an outdoors kind of person uh for a long time I have cut down trees in the forest I've you I've fortunately never been crushed by a tree um but I've been in dangerous situations where I'm moving heavy things and I almost you know got hurt and so the amydala says hm I see that we almost crushed our leg let's take a note falling trees are dangerous and so it recognized that sensory pattern and so when the this big log it creaked and it moved towards me my amigdala said aha I'm prepared for this and it launched me out of the way in other cases though because that that that is a true positive um but when you have an overactive amydala when it's overly sensitive due to trauma whether it's childhood trauma or PTSD or complex PTSD it's a it's got a lot of notes it's got a lot of rules that will cause it to activate and so in in cases where you have pathological anxiety which I Define as anxiety that is um inappropriately activated and lasts longer than it should and we'll talk more about that in just a moment um because anxiety is natural and healthy it's only pathological when it meets in my in my personal definition when it meets those two criteria it it activates inappropriately and uh and lasts too long so anyways knowing that the amydala has its own memory is actually really critical to understanding how to treat it and so what you do is this is this is the part that we'll get into one of the the pretty much the best way to deactivate anxiety is to deliberately activate it and then reprogram it and we'll talk about that throughout the rest of the video uh now the other thing is is that the amydala memories are durable they're more durable than your conscious memories um meaning that uh even if you end up with brain damage which means like you know you have Alzheimer's or something you're amydala does not get Alzheimer's uh your amydala does not forget and this this is this makes evolutionary sense because even if you consciously don't remember what made you afraid if it if it says oh hey we recognized this thing from you know 50 years ago or from when you were a toddler uh let's go ahead and activate because we know from past experience that this is dangerous and so because of that because the amydala uh is is prec cognizant um in terms of it gets your sensory information before that it has its own set of memories and and its memories are very durable this means that it's basically running its own operating system under the hood which is it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective but it that means that it is also very difficult to work with because you have to kind of read the tea leaves and figure out what activates you and what doesn't uh so this is all very critical information to understand about the amydala okay so I probably should have put this slide up earlier but anyways pathological anxiety so pathological anxiety is okay so pathological anxiety is what I Define as and sorry I I misspoke it's actually three criteria not two um so frequent false positives so frequent false positives means that your anxiety gets activated when it shouldn't uh uh inappropriate intensity which means that the level of activation is not proportional to the level of danger or threat uh and so in for instance uh when the log was roll in towards me that was an appropriate level of activation where the activation was so strong that it like fully hijacked my whole body um however going to the doctor's office where they're going to take my blood pressure that is you know okay you can be a little bit of anxious going to the doctor but spiking my heart rate to like 100 and raising my blood pressure as if I'm like ready to fight the doctor off that is an inappropriate level of activation and then finally prolonged duration so basically anxiety is supposed to switch off once the D passes but for people that are either genetically predis predisposed to anxiety and Trauma or people that have um that have trauma in their background that makes them more sensitive it's the jury is still kind of out like it's kind of a chicken or the egg problem or or putting the cart before the horse are sensitive people more easily traumatized or do traumatized people become more sensitive it's a little bit of both anyways my point here though is that some people once the anxiety is active it doesn't switch off um or it doesn't switch off on its own in reasonable time period it's supposed to switch off as soon as the danger is gone um which in some cases it does so another story was um I used to run and host meetups and I stopped doing it because well I was wearing my Fitbit and while I was there my heart rate was just slowly creeping up and it got up to 115 and I'm like okay I need to go home because obviously this is way too much Social pressure for me and the instant that I got in the car my heart rate dropped to 85 because it's like okay cool the social anxiety is gone and it was like like what looking at the graph it was just like straight down I was like okay well clearly um these High Press social situations are very deeply triggering for me so I don't do meetups right now um yeah and so anyways that is an appropriate uh mitigation response where you expect anxiety to just switch off um so if if you have one or more of these things this is what I call pathological anxiety and the reason that I differentiate between Natural Health healthy anxiety and pathological anxiety is because uh it's important for you to know that this is a natural and healthy response it's just exaggerated for you because if you think like oh all anxiety is evil that's not necessarily true in fact in many cases people that have had damage to their amydala they end up in worse situations they get uh they get mugged or they get sexually assaulted or something because they're unable to recognize danger and and behave appropriately so uh yes it might might say like oh wow it would just be great to get my amydala removed but that comes with its own problems there are a few uh cases where amydala might be um uh like injured like deliberately injured or cauterized or whatever um but don't look into that that's not a real thing only a neuro neurologist or neuroscientist can recommend that and even then I think it's fallen out of favor um so it's kind of thought of as more of a an old school thing um especially because of the problems that having your amydala uh damaged removes uh causes okay so the next thing you need to know is exposure therapy so exposure therapy people have generally seen videos about this where it's like you know if someone is you know is terrified of snakes like what you do is you sit them in a chair and you bring a snake into the room and you watch them get activated and then you talk them through it and you you say like take deep breaths and that sort of thing this is the core of treating anxiety because phobias are a kind kind of anxiety remember what I said about how you know the amydala it has its own its own pattern matching its own sensory so you see a snake if you're terrified of snakes or spiders and it activates a full body fear response and so what you do is you actually train the amydala to say actually snakes aren't that bad and so you do this um in some cases you can do it all in one go or or just a few sessions where it's like if someone has the the emotional fortitude and Constitution and they don't fully freak out where it's like okay we bring the snake into the room take some deep breaths allow your body to calm down and then you bring the snake closer and of course the activation goes up and then you take a bunch of deep breaths um and then you wait for the body to calm down until eventually you touch the snake and what this does is it it it gives your it gives your amydala a chance to reprogram itself so here's a really critical thing to know is that if you give into the fear you actually reinforce the signal so if you see a snake and you run away then that then you basically your megala says Ah I did a good job I clearly saved us from danger so we're going to reinforce that signal however if you say no I'm going to get through this um then your mingala says okay that's actually a false positive so basically what exposure therapy does is it teaches your brain and your amydala to recognize the false positives and deprogram them and of course I can I can hear uh the minds and some of my audience saying yeah but what if you don't have a trigger and we'll get to that I promise so in most cases exposure therapy needs to be conducted by a professional in a professional setting however in one of the books that I referenced um she does actually walk you through the process of deliberately exposing yourself if you have known triggers uh and so I've I've tried this myself so one thing that um is I have like horrible acrophobia but I love rock climbing and so like the first few times that I started going climbing again I got way up high on the wall and I was just like okay like you know I'm like holding on to the rope and I'm just like let me just allow myself s to to uh like acclimate to to this uh experience to regulate my nervous system through deep breathing and through just recognizing this is a natural physiological response um part of that is De identifying with it because what some people do is it because anxiety is so all pervasive they end up kind of identifying with it they feel like it's part of them and it it speaks to their personality and their emotions but re distancing recognizing that it is a primitive response and it's just your body doing its thing it's it's just the same as digestion right you eat food your body starts digesting it's just on autopilot same thing with anxiety and so then it's like okay I know that the Primitive structures are active but let's reprogram this and so since then I've gotten much more comfortable on the wall okay so this goes back to recognizing anxiety so uh as I mentioned there are there are still times where I am having a physiological response and I don't there's no affect I don't feel anxious but my body is going through the motions um and other cases there are plenty of people that I have known that either couldn't recognize their anxiety or it was they were so saturated with it all the time that they couldn't recognize it and it just kind of becomes normal and so this is this is why I also defined pathological anxiety as uh in appropriate duration um because there are literally people who are anxious all day every day like if they're awake they're anxious um it's just a matter of in what degree and so there's all kinds of ways that it can manifest um Digest issues gut pain chronic muscle tension chronic pain of all kinds fatigue irritability isolation um so these are all kinds of things so constant UPR regulation your heart rate is actually a pretty reliable indicator of your state of upregulation and so like right now since I'm talking to you my heart rate is 75 which means that's actually pretty normal for me um while I'm awake and moving around so I know right now that I am in a a good level of activation however there's sometimes when I'm making YouTube videos where uh just for whatever reason maybe it's the subject matter or something else going on I'll get up into the 80s or even '90s um because I might be too excited and here's another thing to to keep in mind that I don't have a slide for is that excitement like hyperfocus can also trigger anxiety this is something that I just learned which is why I didn't have a slide for it so as someone with ADHD I tend to hyperfocus and when I hyperfocus my heart rate can go up to 140 I I was like I checked I'm like I don't feel like I'm having a heart attack but uh turns out that hyperfocus or any kind of intense Focus can also activate fight ORF flight because your your amydala is like okay I don't know what's going on but clearly it needs all of your attention and it might be dangerous so um here's the adrenaline let's go um and I'm like Okay cool so I'm working on deprogramming that so anyways my point there is that I for many years I thought that hyperfocus was that's just how it's supposed to feel it's supposed to feel unpleasant your heart is supposed to race and you you're supposed to feel overheated I'm like oh that's actually anxiety that's all that is is an anxiety response um so then there's other physical manifestations uh so in this case you know digestive issues which many neuros spicy people have digestive issues anyways and so this can be really difficult to disentangle where um you know whether it's bloating constipation or whatever uh many neuros spicy people have a lot of digestive issues in some cases it has to do with connective tissue disorders not going to get into that um but I'm not what B what I'm saying is that if you are neuros spicy and you have dig digestive issues it is not automatically anxiety it could be any number of things um but for me a combination of super high fiber diet and probiotics cured pretty much most of my my digestive issues um chronic muscle tension so this is called armoring so if someone has ever touched your arm or your shoulder and they they can sense that your your muscle tone is very high meaning that your muscles are hard all the time this is actually a sign of uh of tonal Activation so you have what's called high muscle tone and that is that you're tense all the time because you're like basically bracing for impact at all times this uh can result in chronic pain because your muscles can't can't take that it can also result in fatigue because again you're constantly expending energy to be ready for uh physical threats there's uh obviously a social impact if you're anxious you might not feel like socializing um one thing that that uh actually very frequently happens if you're in a constant state of upregulation what what what I've noticed socially is that when you go certain places if you go to visit a friend where you feel safe you might fall asleep immediately so this I've seen this phenomenon in multiple places where I had these friends that they would frequently like if someone was having a bad day they're they just made their house very welcoming and so friends would go there when they were having a bad day and just immediately fall asleep sleep on the couch and this is because they finally felt safe and so their body downregulated and it's like okay we're exhausted we need sleep um I had a therapist once called this Warriors rest where it's like okay once the once the battle is over it is time to rest and so then you just your whole body goes slack and it feels really good and you pass out this actually happened to me I went to visit my brother and sister-in-law um this is like early in the pandemic or whatever and I would just pass out because it's like okay I finally am somewhere where I feel safe so next is recognizing these signals and so as I mentioned before once you live with these things for a long time you end up suppressing the signals it's like kind of taking the batteries out of the smoke alarm the smoke is still there but the alarm is no longer going off and so part of what you learn in uh the book uh uh the body keeps the score is reconnecting with those body signals which can be very unpleasant and painful that's what I've got down here recognizing and addressing these signals can be painful difficult or unpleasant because it's like well why don't you just keep it suppressed forever because it will assert itself it'll assert itself in uh chronic diseases inflammation autoimmune disorders uh digestive issues social issues depression anxiety and so basically the the Mantra that I have come up with is you need to feel it to heal it um and it sucks it really does but being on the other side I will say that it is work that is absolutely worth doing another way that anxiety can manifest is uh perfectionism and work AOL ISM uh and so basically the idea is if you're afraid of people's disapproval or you're afraid of people getting angry at you or you're afraid of letting people down um or whatever or or maybe you need people's approval this all figures into anxiety and so anxiety can Propel you to be a perfectionist because what you're what you're what you've been trained to do over many years is you are saying like Okay if I do this exactly right then there won't be any consequences um so this is a this is a form of cognitive anxiety so this is an example of where it's not there's no particular sensation it's not a smell it's not something that you hear it's something that you're thinking about and you're like okay I need to do this task perfectly I have a friend um who is a completionist in video game so if you're not familiar with this concept completionists are the ones that feel like they have to do every single side quest and do every Mission perfectly this is a form of perfectionism it is their their their their brain has been uh conditioned to say we need do everything perfectly otherwise there might be consequences and we need to avoid consequences at all costs and so uh completionism perfectionism and workaholism are all related to anxiety um and as I mentioned there's kind of as far as I can tell there's two kind of ways that it can manifest one is if you are constantly trying to get approval or trying to win you know I need to get straight A's otherwise like I won't you know you get the affection and attention that I need um so there's there's attention seeking or approval seeking but then there's also running away from consequences it can be trying to avoid consequences or trying to get uh positive appraise and so this is actually why it took me longer to figure it out because I have never really been one to like want to seek approval or attention in fact I don't like attention um but what I realized is that in my case it was trying to get away from potential consequences mostly I just want to be left alone I'm Hobbit I think that that's kind of my natural disposition uh my wife says that I'm like an outdoor cat I just kind of come and go and I wander around and sometimes I want to be on my own and I think that's my natural state um so I'm not necessarily the kind who's like I need people's approval um but what I what I what I don't like is disapproval or people getting angry at me um and so this that can also lead to being conflict avoidant um which that's a whole other uh problem anyways so just wanted to point out that that perfectionism workaholism and completionism are all not often not or sorry they're often not always facets of anxiety or driven by anxiety so this leads to what I call complex anxiety or what is typically called generalized anxiety so I got this idea from complex PTSD so the difference between plain vanilla PTSD and complex PTSD is that complex P PTSD has many many many experiences over a long period of time that are that are very traumatic experiences which results in what what Carl Yung called complexes meaning very complex uh associations and triggers that lead to uh you know Vicious Cycles or or other kinds of things and so generalized anxiety is kind of the current clinical definition for like you're just anxious and we don't really know why um this is this is kind of what I alluded to earlier where it's like if you have a phobia of snakes then thinking about snakes can can you know trigger you or seeing a snake can trigger you but if there is is no identifiable trigger this is what I have come to call complex anxiety and this is what many neuros spicy people deal with and so in this case there are undefined triggers this is the number one thing um undefined triggers where it's like I don't really know what's causing it um you know and it can be very difficult to nail down like oh this is one thing and so it's kind of like you know the the reason that I picked this this this tangled web is you know that that that phone game that you see ads for where there's like it's a peg board and there's a bunch of Tangled Up wires and you have to untangle the wires untangling complex anxiety is like that game where it's like okay you know trigger trigger a is wrapped up in trigger b c and d and so now you need to untangle all of them one at a time and and as you identify the triggers one at a time you can untangle them but it is a long process and so the other thing here is that you can have triggers that trigger each other and so what I mean by this is you might have a cognitive activation like so say for instance you're afraid of snakes and so then you think of snakes and you're now activated your your anxiety is now activated but then another trigger could be the physical sensation of being activated the sensation of anxiety can make you feel more anxious which is why uh for some people coffee or other substances can trigger anxiety um so for instance um well anyways the the the the physical sensation because remember the amydala can act be activated through cogn cognition through thinking it can also be activated through Sensations and those Sensations could be external or internal to your body and So like um if I get too hot for whatever reason that triggers my anxiety unless I'm out for a walk in a summer day but if I'm too hot at home then that triggers my anxiety so it's like I'm under a blanket I get too warm now I have anxiety great the the reason I call it complex anxiety is because of those kind of like multiple triggers that can feed off of each other um and this makes treatment more challenging because there's no one target to hit but what I am happy to report is that through diligently working through one trigger after another and kind of using that acclamation process that exposure therapy process um I am in much better shape my heart rate is 74 even though I'm activated right now I'm obviously very animated I'm talking so I am not in a state of anxiety even though I am excited and talking to you so you know again in sample size n of one um I I hope that I understand as uh someone who can give you hope that even though I'm neuros spicey even though I've had um you know a moderately High Ace score and various forms of traumas and everything else I have worked through much of my anxiety okay so now you have the neurophysiology and the background of anxiety let's get straight to the Brass tax what are the actual physical things that you can do uh literally every day to work through this this is what has worked for me now the first thing that you need to know is What's called the Entourage effect so the Entourage effect is a clinical term referring to the idea that um pairing treatments together often results in Far More efficacy than doing one at a time this is the number one thing particularly if you have complex anxiety is just one practice is not going to be enough uh you know for some people just doing yoga cured their anxiety great I'm happy for them for other people just going on daily bike rides cured their anxiety great but what I found is that is that going all in on one modality one treatment modality is not enough and so uh combining them for the Entourage effect is like okay cool here are five things that you can do on a daily basis to work through this stuff so you get compounding effects you get enhanced Effectiveness and you also get a holistic approach so uh that's why I started this section with this is because it is particularly those of us that are neuros spicy or if you have complex PTSD and complex anxiety um you need to use the Entourage effect okay so the first thing is Yoga so yoga is basically breathing and meditation combined it is an ancient practice that's been around for hundreds of years thousands of years I don't even know how old yoga is but it has been scientifically and clinically proved to uh reduce anxiety and on days where I'm still struggling I will literally go to the gym just to do yoga because going to a place with a specific purpose uh makes it a little bit easier to do so uh another aspect of yoga that's really good is that it is about reconnecting with your body and so in this case uh when I really when I first started my healing Journey yoga was my go-to because as I started feeling all the tension throughout my body yoga was one of the best ways to release that tension and get in touch with it and like I said yes it really sucks but um when you understand that yoga is primarily it is it is basically just deep breathing combined with meditation um combined with stretching it looking at it from an empirical objective standpoint deep breathing meditation and stretching all in one um and getting in touch with with not just what the emotions the thoughts but also your whole body this is this makes it one of the best single things you can do it's not the only thing that that you need to do though um but if you don't have the energy to do anything else yoga or meditation is a good start uh the second thing is mindfulness meditation so if basically mindfulness medit Med itation is Yoga without the stretching so if you don't have any energy if you're if you're in a state of collapse or freeze and all you can do is sit still or even lay flat on the floor which many of us have been there um this is just you know take the deep breaths feel the feelings both the physical Sensations And the emotions and just let it all wash through your through your body and then implied in both of these cases is when you're activated you can use this as a way to deactivate the amydala and tell it hey this was a false positive we're actually safe here uh one thing that I forgot to mention is that while you're activated you actually might find it difficult to take deep breaths this is because you're in a freeze response or a collapse response and and uh what's it called it's called like tonal paralysis or whatever uh you might even find it difficult to speak during this period uh and the reason is because your your amydala is and your whole body has been said okay we need to be as quiet and still as possible in order to wait for the danger to pass which is why you might have no energy or no fatigue it's not that there's something physically wrong with your body it is that your body has flipped the master off switch um mindfulness meditation and yoga are one of a really good way to come out of collapse and freeze uh and there's a few other ways but if you are in that state you might notice that like okay cool cuz I guess one thing that I meant forgot to mention is that uh anxiety can cause upregulation where you know your heart is going and you're breathing and you're you loud and everything it can also cause freeze and collapse which is kind of the opposite you might be hypot tonal which is like you might find it difficult to even move around there have been times where it's like walking felt hard and that's because the freeze or collapse response was so strong so if you're stuck in collapse or freeze then mindfulness meditation and some light yoga is a good way to come out of that because you're telling your body we're safe we can re-engage we can start breathing again and that sort of thing uh next up is strength training so if you're in if you're a state of high activation this is what I found works best for me is if like you know if there's some big grave threat out there like you know I get a nasty email from someone or have I don't have a corporate job anymore but when I thought that I was about to lose my job and I'm just like just the fear takes over or the anger takes over strength training was Far and Away the best thing for me and the reason is because it's what I call a capital exertion and so the idea is that like you're you're exerting yourself near your Max and you're that tells your body we are fighting back as hard as we can which that has a really great way of deactivating your amigdala usually like I never regret going to the gym um even if I come back tired I feel better and I feel more relaxed and and going to the gym and doing some strength training is a really great way to activate that Warrior's rest now one thing that I will caution you if you are new to the gym make sure you learn how to do gym properly like get a personal trainer or whatever cuz you can and will hurt yourself real bad at the gym I speak from personal experience can you can make muscle pain worse you can make joint pain worse you can hurt yourself in a way that is a permanent injury so be very very careful if you carry anxiety to the gym and make sure that you understand how to do it in a controlled and safe way now uh that being said like I cannot sing the Praises of of like strength training enough and even if it's only like three sets of five right like often it doesn't take much to deactivate it because again you're really engaging all of your muscles and you're you're you're giving an outlet to that fight ORF flight response you're saying like you know imagine that you're punching a bear or you know that you're arm wrestling a gorilla or whatever and your body is satisfied because remember anxiety is a very primitive response anxiety predates humans um and so all all all that you need to do to satisfy your body and your amydala is like hey look you know we did this thing um some people like going to the gym they like doing kickbox you know if like there's the The Stereotype the Trope of like you know oh I had a bad day so I'm going to go take it out on a punching bag that really works for some people for whatever reason it doesn't work for me um but if but doing some kind of heavy exertion um does have the neurophysiological uh activation that you need in order to switch off anxiety even easier in some cases is cardiovascular exercise so even going for a walk in nature as short as 5 minutes has been demonstrated to greatly reduce anxiety I often walk for 2 or 3 hours a day that's just because of my ADHD I have a tremendous amount of energy and I also walk to think but uh whether it's walking or swimming or biking whatever cardiovascular exercise is a really good way of one getting in touch with your body but also just getting all the juices flowing and getting the deep breath work going um so like for instance if I'm having a rough day when I go for a walk I'll make sure that I do deep breathing exercises while I am walking and I can even watch it happen in real time where it's like if I you know get super upregulated while I'm working on a YouTube video it happens it's like okay wow my heart rate got up to 110 let's go for a walk and calm down and so as I'm going for a walk I'll take those deep breaths and of course like I'm walking but still my heart rate will go down to like 90 which is good for a walk and then I come home and I feel better so exercise exercise exercise mindfulness meditation yoga these are four things that you can do on a daily basis or near daily basis particular particularly while the anxiety is activated this that's one of the key things is you got to feel it to heal it it's got to be activated and that that montra actually comes from that book uh rewire your anxious brain which is what I she said it different she said like activate it to reduce it or something anyways you got to feel it to heal it so if if it's activated and again with complex anxiety or generalized anxiety you don't know what the activation is but you can still teach your amydala that it was a false positive that is one of the key things that I want to teach you here in this video is that it is about identifying and deprogramming those false positives now remember you can't get rid of anxiety anxiety is permanent it is a natural and healthy thing that predates Humanity by literally millions of years but what you can do is you can attenuate anxiety or reprogram it and then finally the thing that that that is the easiest to do particularly if you wake up anxious is deep breathing so many people whether you have trauma or anxiety or PTSD or whatever sleep can be really bad uh deep breathing however uh one can uh accelerate getting to sleep it can also help you get back to sleep particularly if you wake up upregulated so um it is it is a natural way to downregulate um it is one of the easiest and simplest things you can do if you're in too much pain or too tired to do any literally anything else you can do deep breathing yeah so I remember the first time that I learned about deep breathing for sleep I was like whatever it can't be that it can't possi be that effective and so like I got in bed I started doing deep breathing and next thing I knew I woke up the next morning I'm like well I'll be damned that worked well it doesn't always work but it can definitely help and so uh deep breathing sometimes you'll you'll find yourself yawning so what most people don't realize about yawning is that it's not to get oxygen yawning is actually a downregulation thing it is a natural like oh hey let's like let's Force our body to take a deep breath to downregulate and you'll notice that dogs do this particularly after they get excited they'll like do the yawn and then they'll go that is a downregulation thing so sigh of relief is literally a way to downregulate your uh your your nervous system um and of course even just doing that deep breath that I did made me feel good um now obviously if you have complex anxiety or pathological anxiety it might be resistant against um one of these things which is why I emphasize the Entourage effect but uh I cannot sing the the Praises of deep breathing enough uh you start there you'll be good um one thing that I forgot to mention about yoga and stretching is that uh one of the things about uh stretching is that that can change your muscle tone and so because what you learn in the body keeps the score of that book is that um your your body has its own memory as well which means that you have to shake it out um so sometimes as you're experiencing this anxiety and working through it like you might have to like shake it out you might have to wiggle around or you know kind of whatever which is why I recommended yoga and going to the gym because physically using your body is a really great way of releasing the tension and the trauma and anxiety I forgot to to drive that point home um okay so as we're getting closer to the end of the video I wanted to teach you a simple framework that I use to check in with myself um because if I notice that I don't feel good um for whatever reason you know because I'm nervos spicy or whatever um is what I call the pies method uh and so this is a very simple like quick check that I can use to figure out like okay what is it that I need right now and that is it pies stands for physical intellectual emotional and social So Physical is like okay am I physically uncomfortable am I physically in pain do I need sleep am I'm H am I hungry like is is whatever is wrong is it a physical need yes or no okay if it's yes then fix the physical need if it is it an intellectual need am I bored right because boredom can also trigger anxiety and all C all kinds of other things so if I have intellectual needs or if I'm intellectually overstimulated that's another thing um then emotional is it something emotional did something happen today that is that I need to process emotionally like you know did I read something on the news like because there's lots of horrible news um it might be that I'm triggered by something that I heard or saw in the news it might be that like a friend is mad at me and that's the emotional processing that I need to do uh and then finally social which is like am I bored socially do I need to connect with people or am am I socially overburdened and my social battery is dead and I need to recharge um so this is something that I do uh almost on a daily basis to check in with myself to figure out like okay what is it that I need right now so I hope you uh get a a little bit out of using the pies method and then uh one of the last things is social warm-up so I got this from that book um the the the better Small Talk book uh which is basically use singing like sing in the shower or sing in the car as a way to warm up your vocal cords and also regul your your nervous system so right now my heart rate has gone down to 72 cuz here's the thing is talking is actually a really great way to uh to regulate your nervous system because you're being heard because you're expressing yourself and singing is a really great way to regulate your entire nervous system because it takes your entire body and you have to feel your emotions in order to sing and so uh there's there's other theories like poly vagel Theory I didn't cite poly vagel Theory because I read it and I didn't find it too compelling lots of people like it but anyways the idea is that activating everything down the center line actually changes the tone of your inter changes the tone of your anic nervous system so that it is more regulated and aligned and so the idea though is uh you sing it activates your vocal cords it gets you in touch with your emotions and gets you ready to socialize so this is something that that like uh my wife and I just kind of did automatically like we discovered this on accident like uh when we were still friends and and when we started dating and I'd be like on my way to see her I'd sing in the car and why cuz then I'd get there and I'm like yeah let's let's hang out let's talk and then she did the same as when she was coming to visit me cuz you know Young Love you're nervous or whatever uh but yeah so this works if you're on your way to parties if you're on your way to a Meetup or whatever um now one thing I will say is that you can't overdo it you can actually get yourself into a state of upregulation or hyper hyper arousal uh through this so as with as with all things moderation is key so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this let me know in the comments um if there's any parts of this that you want me to unpack further but yeah good luck out there um I hope this really helped um and uh reduces anxiety for a lot of people have a good one
