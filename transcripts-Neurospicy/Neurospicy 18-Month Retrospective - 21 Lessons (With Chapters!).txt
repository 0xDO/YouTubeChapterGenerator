hello everybody David Shapiro here with a video this one's going to be a little bit long um this is an 18-month retrospective so for some background I uh due to several things that happened in my life all at once um about 18 months ago I came to the crashing realization that I am uh neurodiverse after having been in uh denial for a long time I'll unpack a lot of the different aspects and stuff um but basically the point of this video is uh lessons I've learned the hard way and I've got them all packaged up and codified in um easily digestible slides and oh by the way you can download this slide deck if you want to use it uh link is in the description um and please use it for your own reference watch the video multiple times whatever you need to do watch it on 2x speed uh I know many of you watching um may or may not be able to sit through a 45 minute video or however long it ends up being uh all right so also before we get started I've got a couple of warnings first if you are a Tippy And to clarify the word Tippy is a pejorative for neurotypical person I use it just because well it's short but also um you know we've been called mean things and I think that uh you know using the word Tippy is uh it's not particularly mean um but if you are a tippy and you find this offensive you don't have to watch it this video is not for you unless you're curious and you want to know what it's like uh and or if you are in doubt if you're on the fence I have a lot of people reach out to me saying I thought that I was a Tippy but maybe I am actually spicy speaking of if you hear me use the word neuros spicy I use neuros spicy instead of neurod Divergent because it is not normative I honestly personally believe that like up to 80% of people are on the Spectrum or on some kind of neurodiversity spectrum and so the myth of neurotypical people is well a myth I I don't think anyone is actually neurotypical I think that we just have a lot of uh cultural and inherited uh trauma largely from Victorian England um and other places but basically we all are forced to pretend like we are members of the British aristocracy um and that's a whole other can of worms anyways I have a right to be angry um if that makes you uncomfortable um tough stop watching the video um hateful comments will be reported not just removed if if you are spicy or you suspect you're spicy this video may also be difficult because it May challenge your worldview or Notions that you have about yourself so let's Dive Right In Like I said this is an 18-month retrospective uh one last disclaimer a medical disclaimer uh as you see on the screen always seek medical advice and and education from licensed professionals I am not a licensed professional of any uh means measure or whatever um basically I am sharing my personal opinions and personal experience as such this information is provided as is all right let's get into it so one of the first and most important things that I have found about navigating the world as a neuros spicy person is that most people uh abide by what I call emotional Primacy and so basically emotional Primacy is the idea that uh most people put their emotions first and foremost and sometimes only their emotions uh as one commenter said it's almost as if tippies are on emotional autopilot and I thought that that was a really good way of of characterizing it is that if you grow up as a neurotypical person who is treated fairly and has uh mainstream reactions you can trust your emotions and you can operate entirely on emotional Instinct and other people will understand that and go along with it um but if you have not been treated fairly or if your reactions and needs are not accepted then you learn to suppress your emotions and we'll talk about that in a little bit more in an upcoming slide but basically you need to know that many people I don't know if it's most people but many people maybe about 50% give or take I don't have any numbers on this but many people if not most people operate on this principle of emotional Primacy which means that if they are not in an emotionally receptive State they will not engage with you properly or they will not engage at all or they might be hostile um there's also the concept of emotional salience which means that if something doesn't resonate with someone's emotions they usually either don't accept it or ignore it entirely which is bewildering as hell to me as a as an autistic neuros spicy systems thinker um basically if someone does not understand something on an emotional level it doesn't exist to them um and so therefore if you want to engage with people people particularly tippies you have to first and foremost and always cater to their emotions um and understand that they are driven entirely by emotions and this um is also kind of flies in the face of a trend uh lately where there's this like this belief in society that like oh you should be rational and logical and men are rational and logical um but the truth is is that most people are 100% emotional beings um and I'm glad to see this more and more I I read in a book recently um I don't remember which book it was but it was like um it was actually launched by Jeff what's his name um but he's talking about how like this is a marketing guy and he's like yeah humans are entirely emotional and then we just paper over uh our decisions postao with a veneer of logic um and I had a someone in my writing group say basically the same thing maybe that's where they heard it from anyways so remember that people people are uh at their core entirely emotional and if they believe that they're logical or rational they're actually operating at an emotional self-awareness deficit now I'm not saying that neurotypicals or that that neuros spicy people like myself are not emotional but what I am saying is that um our relationship to our emotions is different and like I said we'll unpack that now another thing that you need to know about navigating the neurotypical world or the tippies is that they have a fundamentally different relationship to the truth and so the truth to tippies is entirely emotional based on social and emotional context and so what I mean by that is that uh truth to them is defined by their social group and so their relationship to facts information and Truth is almost entirely dependent upon the prevailing beliefs of their epistemic tribe or their or their group and so this is really confusing to us because especially until I learned that that's how typ that that's how tippies work um I was like why are so many people just utterly hostile to the truth and that and it's explained very simply by the difference because us neuros spicy people we place less um less importance on solidarity and Conformity and when you understand that it's just it's literally just you change the order of priority from you know tribe first to intellectual r first we still have our epistemic tribes again I'm not saying that like we are unique and we are beings of pure Vulcan Logic No I'm not saying that I'm just saying that we have a different order of preference so for instance um we can still be susceptible to group think and Echo Chambers and epistemic tribes but at the same time part of our tribal bias is towards intellectual rigor um and unpacking things rather than Conformity and solidarity so again it when you don't know this it can look like wow those people are demented they're living in another world but when you understand that Tippy's just part of their worldview is uh group solidarity um and social Conformity it makes sense because it's like to them truth is relative because their social group is more important to them than intellectual rigor whereas for us it is reversed again not saying that we're immune to group think and that sort of stuff just that the priorities are shifted uh neurotypical privilege this is something that is that takes a little while to understand and unpack uh but basically one of the primary things that I have come to view as one of the most important aspects to understand is that the the greatest neurotypical privilege is that the status quo the the the the uh group that has the most power they're the ones that get to Define what is quote unquote normal and what is quote unquote healthy um and so because of that this leads to a sense of entitlement that it's like oh well I'm normal and healthy and you are not um and this often results in um all kinds of things such as abusive behaviors manipulative behaviors um different kinds of harms and and being judgmental and what's really interesting is because this is couched under the understanding of um of social norms human all human brains have this thing where um if there is a norm violation the person who has violated the norm you are righteously Justified to hurt them um and it's actually neurologically proven that uh punishing a norm violation is very biochemically rewarding it is as rewarding as drugs and so this is why you end up with people on the internet that um basically make a career out of you know being a social justice Warrior because they get a dopamine hit every time they you know stick it to someone else and this is this is not a liberal or conservative thing a left or right thing um or woke versus non-woke literally everyone does this it's just there's different tests that they do so there's Purity tests on both sides there's all kinds of things but in the context of uh neurotypical privilege or Tippy privilege versus neuros spicy privilege um it's really interesting because sometimes the in my observation people who are otherwise well-respected members of of society or or groups they can become the most vicious backstabbing just like insane people um when they are engaging with neuros spicy people they basically become sociopaths I still don't fully understand this change maybe it's that like maybe they it was a latent um like psychopathy all along um and then once they have once they have an outlet it's like oh I can become I can let all of my abuse out on that person and I'll talk more about predatory um reactions in a little bit um and I I'm not just saying again I need to be um cautious I'm not saying if someone is a Tippy they all have latent psychopathy but what I am saying is that uh certainly when someone when some people realize that they are dealing with someone who is neuros spicy they can become really really really mean um now so this ties back to the first slide and this is a concept called uh forced self- neglect so forced self- neglect that's a mouthful sorry um basically when you are forced to move through a world where your needs are not recognized acknowledged or catered to or in fact you are punished you are actively punished and harmed for having those needs you learn to disconnect from those needs and so this is um this is based on systematic deprivation so if you have special needs whether it's dietary needs or social needs or whatever you learn to suppress those needs and I'll uh have there's another slide near the end of this deck talking about unsuppress those needs and so over time you adapt to this suppression um and then like it just goes away uh well it doesn't go away you you learn to ignore it basically but it's there um and so this forced self- neglect is a really big component of you need to understand this as part of um healing in order to reconnect with your true self which again I have many slides unpacking all of these so um if you're afraid that I'm about to move on too quickly don't worry we will come back to some of these Concepts and look at it from different perspectives now this one is probably one of my most controversial observations I'm not going to say opinion observation whatever so when you look at the world through a neurotypical lens you often will see people with ADHD and ASD and HSP and giftedness being pathologized or being being characterized as having deficits we might have attention deficits we might have uh executive function deficits we might have sensory deficits or social whatever deficits deficits deficits however if you flip the script and you look at the world from a narrow spicy lens and you say well what if we're the normal ones then the world looks very different so I am all four of these ADHD ASD HSP and gifted so here's how the world looks to me um so first from my ADHD perspective uh most people look really profoundly slow um nobody works as fast as I do and I mean nobody and like I I tell my wife and others like in three hours I do what a Tippy does in a week um and I don't understand why like people are that slow but they are and that's just how it is and it's like okay well the rest of the world is moving at a snail's pace I don't understand that um but but because I don't pathologize my ADHD it's like oh actually I have the ability to hyperfocus when things move at my pace and I actually have a huge appetite for stimulation and productivity um and so but if I am forced to move at a Tippy Pace I get bored and I walk away so I have quote attention deficits that's absolute horseshit I don't I don't have any problem with attention other people are just too damn slow um as a systemizing autistic person um this so moving on to point two as an autistic systemizing person um the rest of the world seems mostly completely oblivious to the way things work um it's very strange to me that like like trying to engage with people who do not have uh systems thinking or uh or cause and effect thinking and that sort of stuff and so as an example I had uh my autistic friend text me like why is it so hard to talk to these people in this business about the way things work and you know like this spreadsheet is over here and this protocol is here and it's all super inefficient and broken and I'm like yeah we're systems thinkers and most people aren't and we often wonder how the world functions but the truth is the world often doesn't function and it's partly because most humans are not systems thinkers um and so yeah the world is incredibly inefficient it's incredibly broken and there are completely backasswards asinine systems in place because most people are not systems thinkers and it this is the thing where it's like trying to teach a pigeon to play chess if someone it like systems thinking is honestly Beyond the epistemic Horizon of most people and so you talk about like look I observed these three things and it means this and people will look at you like you're insane like you have three heads and it's like you can't possibly know that because it is outside of the realm of what they think is actually possible for a human brain to do and so when I say like look at these set of facts why are you not coming to the same conclusion and then a year or two later or a couple months later I'm proven right and I've literally had people say you couldn't possibly have known that you just guessed and you happen to be right it's like no I actually knew and I this is a pattern I am right way more often than I am wrong particularly in the long run from an HSP perspective most people are barely sentient um and what I mean by this is and I know this is going to be a super offensive opinion but but uh the amount of self-awareness and environmental awareness and emotional awareness and and sensory awareness that people have um compared to hsps it's like they're not even conscious or it's like they're barely awake um and so you know people are are right now all arguing about like whether or not AI is conscious or sentient and I'm like most humans barely qualify as conscious or sentient as far as I'm concerned now I'm not saying like they're not even animals and they're just robots they're automatons what I'm saying is is that self-awareness um and and all the aspects that go into Consciousness and sentience it is not a binary it is not a true or false it is a spectrum it is a gradient and hsps are much further along that gradient than many other people and then as a gifted person uh who is at least three standard deviations above average I will say that on the extreme right tail of the bell curve most of the world from my perspective looks like they're operating um with intellectual disabil ities um and like I know that that's super offensive to say and it's like well Dave you're above average it's not right for you to look at the rest of us as cognitively challenged but I'm am tired of being pathologized for being smart um so you know like if you can't take what I tell people is if you can't take it don't dish it out so like if you don't want to be pathologized for being like average intelligence then don't pathologize people for being smarter than you um I've I've had people just get incredibly insanely angry um when I just make the observations some people are smarter than others like they're like oh that's elitist and I'm like it's a fact right like you don't get angry when someone's taller than you it's a fact it is a measurable fact that someone is taller than you or shorter than you it is also likewise a fact that some people are smarter than you but because we particularly in America and the West we have this idea that like equality before the law means that all people are like always equal in all measures and that and that it's taboo to even say like anything to the contrary if you read the way that people spoke a hundred years ago like we were very very comfortable with saying like oh yeah that person's kind of a dolled but that's okay they're nice guy or that person's really smart like we should we should do that but for whatever reason culturally we have uh I guess decided that we should not we should not assess or appraise people's intelligence I don't know know why because that's harm Society um okay so moving on uh pathologizing differences so what basically what this is is when you look at the world through a neurotypical lens it is very easy to um and one of the things that they do is pathologize our needs they say well you have these weird sensory needs so we're going to pathologize that and say that it's actually a disorder or you have um you know these these interesting social dynamics or these communication skills and so we're going to we're going to call those deficits or you H you have uh meltdowns after years and years of abuse so we're going to actually characterize that as borderline personality disorder um where in fact actually having meltdowns when your sensory needs and emotional needs are not met for literally years on end is a healthy and natural response and so uh and then also some of the things that I was just talking about like the the looking at the World Through My Lens is like I've been called a narcissist it's like actually I'm the victim of narcissists um but you know again by pathologizing things that are objectively measurable and healthy and normal um this is how neurotypical society and mainstream Society um continues to other us or ostracize or marginalize people like us as they want to say well there's more of us than there are of you so we are going to Define what is good in the center here and you are an Centric and therefore eccentric eccentric is bad and and now that you are being othered and you are eccentric it is now okay to exclude you to bully you harm you and exploit you now again it might sound like oh this is a vicious World in some cases this is conscious and deliberate but in most cases it is completely just unconscious and it is a social Paradigm it is just a trend that is embedded in society that we don't really talk about too much um so one of the key lessons that I learned um is don't scare the tippies uh so this is a masking strategy where basically you uh you have to hide your true abilities um because when tippies see what unbridled gift giftedness is capable of when tippies um like experience the true like level of empathy and perceptiveness of H PS it makes them very very very deeply uncomfortable um and so what I here's an example of what I mean hsps will often like be able to like jump into a meeting or like come into a room and immediately get a very deep read on the room and understand um the emotional and social dynamics going on um to the point that it almost feels like telepathy or or some kind of extra sensory perception um and then also uh many hsps are so perceptive that after talking with someone for just a very short period of time they're able to very quickly int it and triangulate pretty much exactly what's going on in their head and say it to them in a way that they're not prepared to to like receive like again it's outside of their their epistemic Horizon their cognitive Horizon they don't believe that it is possible for someone to be that perceptive and so that it makes them very uncomfortable to be perceived like that um this is doubly true for disordered individuals because um people like like narcissists um and other uh pathological Liars the worst thing to them is to be seen and so if if your like your perceptiveness as an HSP is actually an active threat to many disordered people like Psychopaths like sociopaths like narcissists like liars um because if you can detect their BS you are an active threat to them and so don't scare the tippies means we are often encouraged or coerced to hide our perceptiveness to hide our intellectual prowess to hide our everything um and it can result in um alienation such as being ostracized from a group or kicked out um in my case it has resulted in sabotage both career sabotage and social sabotage um you know like one thing that I can do as a highly gifted person is I can pick up you know a handful of books on a topic and become an expert in it you know the meme of uh of of Tony Stark like where he was talking about like quantum physics and they're like when did you become an expert on this and he's like last night I did the reading like I can't read quite that fast but like seriously like give me a week and like a stack of books and I'll read something and I'll become an expert on it and that is for whatever reason offensive to people um I've literally had people with phds criticize me for learning by reading books they're like Dave's weird he learns by reading books and I'm like you're a you're a freaking like PhD like how did you get your PhD anyways so don't scare the tippies next up is socially endorsed gaslighting so this is the thing this is this is kind of the net effect of many of the things that I'm talking about up to this up to this point which is basically when you view the world through a neurotypical lens with all the uh assumptions and expectations that this has it's like ah well as a neurotypical person with this set of experiences I believe that all people have this range of mental abilities this range of emotional abilities this range of needs I will characterize this need is healthy and this need is unhealthy um everyone should be able to do X Y and Z and so then when you see someone who falls outside of that you know very narrowly defined Vin diagram it's like ah that person is either making stuff up they are wrong they're attention seeking um and so on and so forth and so it's like well I don't have any schema to understand your needs and what you're saying and your experience so I'm just going to assume that you are wrong or that you are making it up and I'm going to tell you as such I'm going to say it's all just in your head um yeah so this happens uh quite extensively with pretty much all authority figures whether it's doctors teachers uh parents who don't get it although many cases it's parents that are just in denial because uh got some news for you neuros spiciness runs in families there is a reason for that U but we'll get to we'll get to some of the intergenerational stuff in a bit um but basically uh every authority figure in your life might Gaslight you because they don't understand what you need like they don't understand when it's like I can't eat that food because it hurts me um and like that's something that I'm still working on repairing is my relationship to food I forgot to add a slide for that anyways um yeah so it's like if we're picky eaters it's because some food literally hurts us um or if we are like we like I wear oversized sweaters why because they're comfortable and they're very um they're very soothing to me um and like I managed to find one that looks good enough um but I know that I look I look better um if I wear tighter clothes but oh my God tight clothes make me want to die um so anyways um but now that I have a better schema for understanding that one from a certain lens I look weird or eccentric or disordered or whatever but from a neuros spicy lens it's like oh well all these needs are just obvious and just do them institutional gatekeeping so this Builds on the last idea so the idea is that um the institutions such as uh government um academic institutions businesses uh medical establishments so all the big institutions um that that basically run our world um they either implicitly or explicitly have neurotypical gatekeeping so basically the tippies only let other tippies in to be decision makers and so what this does is it implicitly gives the tippy perspective more precedence over every other perspective it gives them control and it gives them the privilege to Define what is normal and this creates persistent biases and misunderstandings so basically if only the tippies are allowed to decide what is medically normal and what is medically healthy or what is accepted behavior in businesses um then their view is going to be the status quo by default uh it's a pretty simple idea but it's worth saying um okay so next up is learned helplessness so learned helplessness is that after literally years sometimes many decades of not having any relief and not having any help and not finding any answers you often give up um this is this is kind of where I was heading until I had like the big giant breakthrough like 18 months ago and I was like cuz I had done all kinds of stuff to try and understand what was going on I practiced Zen I learned personality theory I took an IQ test and so like I knew that like okay like my IQ is like over 145 um but like I didn't know about the rest of neurodiversity Cu at the time it was like you were either profoundly autistic and you know basically needed to be you know cared for or you were an aspie but even being asp was not well defined you know 12 years ago or whenever it was I was looking into this stuff so anyways you end up you know you you get bullied at work you get bullied at home you get bullied by your friends um you lose opportunities and you just don't understand what's going on and so part of a reaction to this I mean lots of healthy reactions you know Despair and hopelessness um belief that like you kind of get Frozen you kind of get stuck so I call this like you're paralyzed or you're Frozen um and you end up with with a fixed mindset um leads to depression and anxiety are the two most common reactions um social withdrawal uh toxic relationships even poverty um you know job loss that kind of stuff and so this is like making the pivot from a frozen mindset or a fixed mindset to a growth mindset is really hard and it also takes a long time because also I started some of the healing Journey before realizing I was autistic so I was already in a growth mindset after a fail very toxic relationship um and so I I had learned about relationship schemas but learning about the learning about being neuros spicy changed everything like my interpretation of literally my entire life and my entire family and so like yeah I guess just what I'm the point that I'm trying to drive home here is that coming to terms with something that is fundamental to you it's not just something that happened to you like nature versus nurture it is literally in my genetic nature to be the way that I am and learning what is nature versus nurture uh is really important but also like I said a minute ago understanding that a lot of the things that I have struggled with my family also struggled with and they never got relief all the information that I'm benefitting from is brand new and so it's like oh well my family wasn't the best but I have much more empathy understanding that they struggled with all the same things that I struggle with um but they also never had answers uh so yeah like that really sucks um okay so I alluded to this a little while ago and this is being targeted so uh obviously like this is not just you know tippies by and large I'm not saying that every Tippy is a is a latent Predator but there are a lot of predators out there whether or not they're neurotypical or neuros spicy um whether they're narcissists sexual predators um or just plain greedy or sociopaths or Psychopaths or whatever but one of the things that is almost universally true about um about predators of all kinds is they look for vulnerable people and so because they look for vulnerable people they look for people who are socially isolated mentally ill uh or have poor understanding of boundaries or any number of things and so because of that we neuros spicy people are often targeted by predators and I and like I mentioned Predators come in all shapes and sizes there are emotional Predators who like want to get you in a relationship and they use things like love bombing to like suck you in or hoovering or whatever there's uh predatory people in the business world who will look to exploit you and basically treat you as like uh as the goose that laid the golden egg um and just like say give me all like I've literally had people message me saying like sign this NDA let's talk about you know all the IP that you're generating and I'm like block um you know and it's it's a really easy test to do it's like okay cool like I you know I appreciate that this is a business opportunity like let me talk about what I need and then they usually disappear or fly off the handle um Predators get really really angry if you call them out and so this is why like basically one of the rules that I have is if I have to push back on someone at all I just block them um because if it gets that far like it's like maybe maybe tippies don't experience this um because they're not targeted by Predators as much um but yeah basically like if I get if I get even the slightest like red flag um or you know if something doesn't pass pass the sniff test it's just like I just block them and it served me well so far I have managed to avoid um being targeted for any number of things for for a while now uh yeah so then another concept that I learned from another YouTuber is the ablest goblin so the ablest goblin is a way of talking about internalized ableism which is basically because of learned helplessness and neurot neurotypical privilege and everything else that's going on in society um you might have internalized ableism you might have uh particularly with in with if you have uh invisible disabilities as um many aspects of neuros spicy are often invisible uh this means that you have internalized uh uh measurements that are unrealistic or unhealthy um or even in my case behaviors such as perfectionism and workaholism um that basically it's like well I should be able to do more and do better because other people are able to do more and do better and even though I have arrived at a point where I am infinitely more productive than neurotypical people I still believe that I am less productive um and I'm still working on that as I mentioned I'm working on repairing my relationship to food I'm also working on repairing my relationship to work so you might end up with ableist beliefs unrealistic standards perfectionism workaholism but then also you can have projection and judgment so basically all of these things every aspect of ableism can be directed internally at yourself or directed externally at other people and so one of the things that I've been working on as I learn to work with other people is not to project my perfectionism onto other people like yes I could do a better job but telling someone that isn't going to help them and I actually have I have a few mentors now and I I definitely recommend finding mentors whether they are also neuros spicy um well I will say that neur fellow neuros spicy mentors are often the best not always um but anyways um and and like one of them said like yeah like it's it's it's it's a basic thing like if you want it done right do it yourself but there's also such a thing as just accepting and tolerating good enough from everyone else but also aiming for good enough for yourself is a way to heal that perfectionism um and I'm able to talk about this because I'm mostly on the other side of it mostly marginalized self-hatred so I picked this graphic because the phenomenon is more familiar particularly with um uh hate crimes committed by LGBT against LGBT so every now and then you'll see in the news where there was like a mass shooting at a gay club um and the and the perpetrator often was themselves like closeted and so this is what's called marginalized self-hatred um and this happen to any marginalized group um but it also happens to us neuros spicy people so often I have been treated worse by fellow neuros spicy people who were in denial or trying to distance themselves from from me in order to say oh look I'm not like Dave I'm not that weird and eccentric I'm more neurotypical and so basically the the the thing here is your true identity it has been pathologized and harmed and so you try and de identify with yourself and as such you also try and de identify with people who are like you um which this is kind of the worst thing because not only are we disconnected from ourselves with marginalized self-hatred and fortunately this is something that I haven't personally struggled with but I've seen it um and I've experienced it you know secondhand I guess um but yeah and so like the key thing here is though is is recognizing this and breaking the cycle because often um some of the some people that have internalized that marginal self-hatred they can be very vicious um because they know exactly what but buttons to press um in order to trigger you or trigger the tippies and so then they say like ah see like I'm not like them look like let's push Dave until he has a meltdown and then and then pathologize the Meltdown as obviously this this is like aggressive behavior or whatever I mean it's like I don't understand why being angry is quote aggressive behavior or even just like so here's here's what I mean is that when someone like me expresses anger it is not like shouting or or just being like I'm you know like blah blah blah like I don't do that I express it very flatly but people see that as very like unnerving because it's like you know it's I don't know why it's unnerving there it's probably like cultural baggage and stuff because there's always all the tropes of like the ice cold sociopathic killer um but like if I try and express myself and just say like I'm upset for these reasons I want you to stop doing this because I'm not expressing myself emotionally the same way that other people do they perceive it as like a threat of violence or something I don't know I've never been violent I was I was just telling my wife I've literally been in a grand total of two fights in my life and both in both cases it was because someone attacked a woman and I stopped the fight um so it's like I don't know anyways but this all goes back to being uh either deliberately or unintentionally miscategorized because if you express your emotions more flatly tippies who are more comtable with screaming and shouting for whatever reasons they perceive that as more threatening than someone making themselves big and screaming um it's there's a lot of hypocrisy um let's see performative inclusion so this is why I I have vowed to never work for a corporation again um and that is because uh corporations only abide by the bottom line um and I probably would even ever work for an academic institution because I've talked to some academic insiders some of my best friends are still our academics and they're like oh yeah like it hasn't gotten any better um but basically so performative inclusion is where they just like you know they they have the meeting they have a Dei Council and then nothing actually happens and so the primary motivation for this is they're doing it for public relations uh reasons or they're doing it or they're doing it because of legal obligations but they don't actually make any sub substantive changes they make the noises they say oh hey we're having a Dei day we're going to you know send out an email about you know black history month we're going to we're going to we're going to have you know a transgender day of visibility and all these things and so these are token efforts uh the the actual real change comes from substantive policies that would uh basically result in harming tippies and so what I mean by this is bullying is basically ignored um and corporations and and academic institutions will bend over backwards to ignore bullying all of them every single one of them they say that they have a zero tolerance policy towards bullying but unless you have empirical proof like video footage of it they will basically say well we don't have any evidence so unless you bring a lawsuit we're not going to pursue this um and any excuse they can use to not investigate it they will so there's a few channels out there um I I'll I'll try and remember to put a link in the description but like um I watched some videos by an HR lawyer who's like who explained all of this and it's like what you need to understand about companies um and this probably extends to to government institutions and academic institutions as well but the HR department is not there for the employee the primary purpose of an HR department is to protect the company from lawsuits so when you understand that you say oh well the reason that HR does a Dei initiative is to reduce the risk of lawsuits it's not to make a better Workforce it is literally about legal drisking and I know this is a really cynical thing but I you know like I don't really blame corporations because their engines that are there to optimize economic efficiency they're not there to optimize social well-being that's not the purpose of a business that's not the purpose of a corporation um which it sucks so but that's the way the world works and I don't like it but I don't know how to change it uh so one thing you can do and this is something that has been good for me which is why I'm wearing my Star Trek outfit and this is why I also ban people who critic ize me for wearing my Star Trek outfit is deliberate non-conformity um my wearing a you know Captain peard shirt is an expression of deliberate non-conformity where it's I'm going to express myself in a way that may or may not trigger people and if it triggers someone that's their problem it is no longer my problem I am no longer going to internalize someone else's judgment or being triggered and in many cases I suspect the people that are like oh it's difficult to take you seriously because you're wearing a Star Trek shirt it's like it's not a it's not a freaking like swastika it's not you know like there's nothing violent or controversial about it but I think what they're seeing is maybe some Envy or maybe maybe again it's it's that kind of marginalized self-hatred where it's like wow like I wish I could wear a Star Trek outfit but I don't have the courage to do it and I've had people message me like some some of the more conscientious messages they're like like one person said like Dave consider not doing your um AER sort of autism advocacy thing because I don't want that extra attention I said don't worry I'm not going to draw attention to you I'm drawing attention to me I will be the voice I will be the Target and I will implement the zero tolerance policies and I will ban people that don't get this and I will continue with my message um and so that means you know unabashedly being you know self-expression changing your appearances changing the way you speak and the way that you um live and stuff like you know I still feel guilty for walking away from a corporate job because of that aist Goblin but you know what I needed to it was not a healthy environment and I need an environment where it's like you know what I woke up at 1: in the morning this morning I'm just going to go ahead and get my work done and I'll be done by 5: in the morning and then I'm going to go for a walk that's the life that I need the lifestyle that I need it also means um you know changing the way that you uh expect relationships to go and that sort of thing thing um namely get getting rid of people that don't get it and don't respect you so one of the things that happened about what was it about six six months ago or so was as I was coming to terms with um with you know kind of unmasking I decided to unmask my giftedness I decided to unmask all of my cognitive abilities and cognitive needs and it really pissed off a lot of my friends who are no longer my friends they're like wow you're being too vain you're being too narcissist you're not allowed to be angry your anger makes me makes me uncomfortable your um your abilities make me uncomfortable and I'm like okay well like y'all are on the Spectrum too you just don't realize it yet and they're like well whatever so agree to disagree um it is what it is but I then so here's here's what happens here's the takeaway here's what happens when you get rid of people who are not aligned is you make room for people who are aligned and so like you know I I you know when your when your social calendar is empty or emptier and you're like hm well who do I know that is aligned and then you message them and say hey like I've got a I've got a friend that I've known for a while that I've I've been deliberately making more time because we will get together and just talk for like two hours straight about the most obscure philosophical stuff and we'll have a really good talk and actually I need to text him um there I have another slide about building friends in a little bit so we'll get back to that strict boundaries so I've alluded to this and there are numerous reasons that we neuros spicy people need strict boundaries I mentioned Predators earlier um but there's there's some other aspects to it and this is why I had a slide very early on about um about like systematic self- neglect is we are basically taught to not have boundaries we are taught that our boundaries are not acceptable or or tolerated and in fact one of the reasons that I canceled my subscription to the Claude chatbot is because it is incredibly ableist um I can't yeah I canceled my subscription to anthropic because their chatbot is incredibly ableist and it says well no you shouldn't judge people and and have strong boundaries because you need to give everyone the benefit of the doubt the benefit of the doubt is exactly what toxic people rely on um plausible deniability benefit of the doubt and and and and and the good graces of people that are more vulnerable and more desperate this is exactly what um toxic abusive Predators prey on those three things specifically um and I tried to have a conversation with Claude about that and it said no you need to look at the world through this way I'm like you are being aess and it's like well if you disagree with this you can appeal to the um to the to the anthropics board of Ethics or whatever and I was like or I'm going to cancel my subscription and make a YouTube video about it so that's what I'm doing so strict boundaries means canceling a subscription to a chatbot that is an aist Goblin um it also might mean establishing very strong personal limits um I have developed um a more powerful set of gut instincts and I've tested it a few times where so say for instance someone reaches out to me and they want to talk about uh you know a business deal or consulting or whatever and it can it's like it I have this like six sense this intuition it's like something just isn't right and so then I'll I'll every time I give someone the benefit of the doubt like conscientiously saying all right I'll give them a chance it never works out so I just trust my gut instincts um from day one now now obviously trusting your gut instincts if you have not reconnected with your gut instincts don't do that because your gut instincts are to be plating and to be people pleasing so if you're still in the plating and people pleasing don't trust your gut instincts um but what I have done is I trust when I feel suspicious of someone and I have developed a lot well not a lot several several very strong rules but basically it's the one strike your out rule which is like one boundary violation block if I have to push back be like if it gets to the point where I have to push back on someone um because of boundaries or because of not respecting my time block um all of those things and in here's the thing is in some cases I think that that they are being deliberately manipulative um or have ill intentions but in other cases I know they just don't know any better but that is part of neurotypical privilege part of neurotypical privilege is the privilege of being ignorant and saying I don't understand what I did wrong telling someone like if someone tells you I don't understand what I did wrong I don't understand why you're so upset that's gaslighting because that's prioritizing their confusion over your hurt or your anger or or your need for safety so if someone says I don't understand what I did wrong that usually results in a block as well because why I'd rather interact with people that don't have that deficit that don't have that misunderstanding I'd rather interact with people who get it um and that has served me well because like I said that makes more space for people who do get it rather than wasting time and energy on people who don't get it now yes in a in a healthy world if I were neurotypical then all of these things would would seem to be like wow Dave you're like you're super suspicious you're super paranoid but having to move through the world with my uh requirements and vulnerabilities and experiences everything that I'm doing makes perfect sense from my experience and that's why I'm making this video so that you understand that this is actually normal and healthy radical self-acceptance so this has been part of uh like we we talk about authenticity and stuff like that but authenticity is is one thing but radical self-acceptance is like turning it up to 11 so basically there is we are programmed by our culture by our family by our workplace by our friends to understand how we quote unquote should be this includes everything from what we eat how we eat what we do for fun how we feel about the world like you know those friends that I told you about they're like Dave you shouldn't be angry you're not allowed to be angry because it's your fault for being different and it's like that's some hor um so it's like no I actually should be angry because I have been mistreated and I'll talk about um the definitions of healthy anger in just a moment um but so like for instance I mentioned that I'm repairing my relationship with food um like many neuros spicy people I uh I was I was a very like not necessarily a picky eater um I've always been a good eater but there are just certain things that I just would not eat but my uh my stepdad was a very like traditional disciplinarian and he's like you will eat what we give you and you will eat all of it and so I learned that if even if something made me feel sick or hurt me I needed to eat it and I needed to eat all of it um and so because of that I have been a binge eater my entire life I have um I have habitually overeaten and I will continue to eat things even after I feel sick um and so I had to like change the rules so I was like I realized that was the schema which is eat everything in front of me no matter how it makes me feel and so then I said like you know what I'm only now my rule is I'm only going to eat things that I want to eat that make me feel good if something hurts I stop eating it forever and whatever I happen to be craving um I'll eat that but also I will only eat until I am not hungry anymore like I'll like rather than saying eating eating until I'm uncomfortably full now my rule is I will only eat until I am just barely satisfied and that seems to be healthy and so I I made this image because sometimes I just want a plate full of Chicken Fingers um I know that sounds very childish but you know what I'm not trying to impress anyone also I'm a foodie like I love good food I love like really high and Thai and Indian and Mediterranean and Greek but sometimes I just want a plate full of chicken fingers and there's nothing wrong with that uh building friendships so I promised that I would talk a little bit more about how to build friendships as a neuros spicy person uh obviously I talked about losing friends and ejecting people and you know it's very easy to justify being a complete loner especially if you've been mistreated the way that many of us neuros spicy people have and um it was actually it's actually really sad and part of the reason that I wanted to add this is because I've seen quite a few videos lately of people talking about how lonely they are and many of them are neuros spicy um some of them I think are in denial um or at least they haven't publicly come out about being neuros spicy and that's fine like I'm not saying that you have to tell anyone you don't um but once I cleared my social calendar of people that were not aligned with my needs um and not aligned with neuros spicy narratives um I realized like okay well it's basically like me my wife and like one or two friends that I see occasionally and I was like what do I do to fix this and I was like maybe I should join meetup groups maybe I should start meetup groups maybe I should spend more time online like I did all of those things and then it occurred to me I was like wait what I really want is just a few very good close connections I want to be close to people like I'm close to my wife and so then I was like oh well that's easy so I just started texting people I was like I was like it was just not in my mental menu of things that I could do or it's like I like that person let me like just shoot them an email and ask to hang out and it's like so you know I reconnected with some of my my good friends I've made new friends I that's how I got some of my mentors it's just like I was just like I like what this person has to say they seem to get me so I'm going to make the effort to just send a text send an email it's low stakes and just say like I don't tell them like I want to get close to you I just said like I said to them I was like hey I really enjoyed that conversation we had do you want to get coffee and talk again so like my friend that I talk philosophy with like I think that uh I think that like he was Jazz I was like hey man like let's let's go talk philosophy again then and then while we were talking we discovered that we both like climbing so it's like let's go climbing too um but the idea is that it's like it's very focused it's laser focused on one person at a time as a systems thinker like many of many people like me will try and approach friendship systematically which is okay well that means I need to join a group um because groups are lower like pressure like I can just show up I don't have to talk to anyone specifically but what I realized by by hosting and going to groups is that it was actually very empty and I often felt worse um going to groups or hosting groups groups and so what I what instead I've done and this is many many neuros spicy people prefer one-on-one interaction so I was like all right I prefer one-on-one interactions um and I've got a whole bunch of people that I actually admire and appreciate and so I had to get over some social anxiety um and I had to also get over the insecurity of like I honestly like I don't have this feeling anymore and it looked it feels weird to look back on it but I used to have this feeling of like impostor syndrome like I'm not worthy of that person I'm not worthy to be friends with that person they're too good for me and like even just saying that out loud I'm like why did I ever believe that I don't know anyways so now I have like friends from like really cool places like Ivy League schools all over the place um people that work like at the big tech companies people that are like the smartest people that I've ever met some of the kindest people that I ever met like people that I look up to people that impress me and I'm like yeah of course I'm worthy of them like they're worthy of me like this is a good match so anyways uh yeah that's let me know in the comments if you want me to unpack any more of being like building friends as a neuros spicy person or any of the other topics anyways give me some ideas um okay so I promised that we would talk about anger getting in back in touch with anger is actually a really important aspect of coming to terms with being Naros spicy so uh anger is a has a very specific purpose and this is for both men and women for all people all humans um and actually many anim animal um anger is a healthy emotional response to Injustice frustration boundary violations and danger um anger exists on a spectrum from irritation to resentment to rage and the purpose of anger it is a biophysiological response to give you the energy to write a wrong that is the purpose of anger I'm actually getting chills just like articulating that um now as a neuros spicy person we are often our anger is often invalidated we're told to contain it we're told that it's not legitimate um we are told that like we don't have legitimate grievances uh and because of all this we often suppress our anger and so then when you suppress anger it can come out in any number of ways if you if you want to watch some uh videos of uh Dr Gabor mate um he has a he talks a lot about trauma and anger um but so this is like the cliffs notes version uh definitely recommend you look them up but if you suppress anger it can one eventually your body will take it out on itself in the form of autoimmune disease and and and chronic stress and heart disease and all kinds of health issues but you can also take it out on yourself in any number of ways um some people punish themselves by by working too hard or forms of self-deprivation it can come out as um anxiety depression um it can also be transferred to other people and so transfer Trans erence in this case is where uh anger is or displacement displacement or transference I don't remember anyways but basically where emotion is expressed um at the wrong person uh because you might feel like you're not able or allowed to express anger um at the people who deserve it and so you express it at someone who is more vulnerable than yourself which is why unfortunately why uh many traumatized people or neuros spicy people end up taking out their anger or frustration on their dog or their their spouse or their children um and that's something that I never understood until recently I was like I don't understand why how and why a parent could be like deliberately cruel to their child but it was a matter of power they they their child might have been the only person that they had power over and it's like oh that makes more sense to me now or their dog is the only person that they had power over I had seen that like my entire life and so like whenever I interact with like my spouse or my dog or children of any kind it's like I I am very conscientious of the power Dynamic there and I make sure not to ever abuse it um yeah so anyways uh I think that's about it for for anger just understanding that anger is it has a very uh per uh distinct purpose now one one caution that I will have is don't identify with your anger um anger can be very satisfying when you first get in touch with it it can almost be like a luring and this is this is like we all have a model for this because of Star Wars like Sith are like give into your anger and so like literally the philosophy of the Sith is your anger is righteously Justified and you should use it you should weaponize it don't do that um but what I am saying is that anger healthy anger has a purpose but don't indulge in it don't wallow in it and don't deliberately magnify it like use it to write or wrong and then move on Dem minimizing so all of this is part of what is called Dem minimizing and actually uh many dictionaries don't actually have this word minim Dem minimizing they have minimizing but they don't have Dem minimizing so Dem minimizing here let me just read this it involves acknowledging and addressing suppressed bodily signals buried emotions and painful memories this process is often unpleasant and is a critical part of healing from trauma Injustice and mistreatment it's Ain to realizing a smoke alarm has been sounding unnoticed and it's a crucial step in reconnecting with oneself so this is probably the worst part of of uh worst and hardest and longest part of coming to term with being neuros spicy and that is learning to recognize the tension in your body and then when you recognize it it hurts a lot and it's like how was I in this much pain and didn't notice it or um you know reconnecting with like my Digestive Health like realizing like my stomach has hurt for literally like 20 years straight and I just ignored it and then it's like oh now that I'm paying attention to it I have reflex now I have like you know all these other issues but finally I've gotten past that um and I'm actually comfortable in my body most days um and so then you know you you find those signals you unsuppress them and it really sucks um unearthing those those buried emotions really sucks and it can be very difficult uh it's very unpleasant but then it all has to be expressed some way um sometimes that means going to the gym going on a long biking session it might mean crying it might mean shaking like almost to the point of like convulsing um but the idea is like you've like when you've suppressed things for a long period of time you're tense and you're not allowing yourself to express it physically or otherwise um and that can take that can be a long process uh but also the key thing is once you've Dem minimized something you have to make change you have to adapt to say hey let's stop doing the thing that's causing the fire in the first place and that might mean leaving a job it might mean leaving a relationship it might mean changing where you live or changing your lifestyle or any number of other things is legitimate grievances um I think I accidentally deleted the slide I apologize okay so the slide that's missing is legitimate Grievances and so the point of this slide is that all of these things that I'm talking about if you feel them to these are legitimate grievances so a legitimate grievance basically says you have the social emotional uh and legal right to feel the way that you do and to have these grievances with your family with Society with whoever has wronged you this is the key purpose of this of this video is um part of healing part of coming to terms with being neuros spicy is recognizing that your grievances are legitimate now like the anger one that doesn't mean that you have a right to wallow in it and lash out at everyone um sight unseen because you have legitimate grievances all I'm saying is that you don't have to minimize it you don't have to hide it and you don't you also don't have to allow people um to to delegitimize your grievances people are not allowed to Gaslight you but again that doesn't mean that you can then weaponize your grievances as a lot of people try and do particularly like the social justice Warriors online um weaponized grievances don't do anyone any favors but legitimate grievances are worth talking about worth healing from um I'm not going to say worth bonding over but like worth um healing as a group I think that's probably a better way of looking at it okay thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this um like I said links in the description and yeah uh let me know what you think in the comments bye
