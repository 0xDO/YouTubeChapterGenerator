The core objective functions of benevolent and trustworthy AGI are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. These functions are biomimetic, meaning they mimic the fundamental needs of all humans and other life forms. The functions help guide the AGI's thought process and decision making, and are meant to serve as a moral center for the machine.

The way the AGI uses the functions is by first using synthetic dataset datasets to seed the core objective function models. This allows the machine to adapt and use the functions to make pro-social decisions. Second, the AGI records its experiences with the functions and integrates them into fine-tuning data sets for better performance in the future. As the machine learns and gains more experience with the functions, it will develop greater belief in them and be better able to apply them.

The following is an essay by David Shapiro.

In order to achieve its goals, an AI must first understand what those goals are. Currently, the best way to do this is through Heuristic Core Objective Functions (HCOFs). HCOFs are essentially statistical models that can predict what a human would do in a given situation.

There are five main properties of HCOFs:

1. They are flexible and allow for exploration.

2. They are universal, meaning they can be applied to any situation.

3. They are reliable, meaning they can be relied upon to produce consistent results.

4. They are based on data, meaning they are constantly learning and improving.

5. They are wholehearted, meaning they believe in the objectives they are trying to achieve.

There are some common questions and criticisms about HCOFs, but Shapiro addresses them head-on. He argues that HCOFs are the best way to ensure that an AI achieves its goals, whatever those may be.

The person writing this passage has been cheated on and is feeling betrayed. They want to confront their partner and ask for forgiveness in order to rebuild the relationship. A prosperous life for them includes healthy relationships with people they can trust and love.

This person is suffering from anxiety related to the climate crisis. They are experiencing denial, fear, anger, and sadness. It is important for this person to recognize that their symptoms are related to the chronic climate crisis and not something else. They can seek out counseling or treatment to help cope with their anxiety.

Increasing prosperity for this person would include a more stable emotional state which would allow them to better cope with the challenges of the future. They can learn how to self-regulate their emotions and set smart goals to help manage their anxiety about climate change. It is also important for this person to recognize that they are not at fault for feeling anxious about the climate crisis.

If you or someone you know is feeling down and hopeless, there is help available. Counseling or therapy can be extremely beneficial for those dealing with depression. You may notice that the recommendations tend to be focused on counseling and therapy. This is due, in part, to the training data set used. It is important to note that most people can benefit from therapy.

A prosperous life for this person would include living a life that is less stressful and more fulfilling. They could be encouraged to find ways to increase their social support network, including finding new friends, hobbies, and interests. The key is to find ways to increase their emotional prosperity. The lack of emotional prosperity has led to a lack of financial prosperity.

This person may benefit from reading books about empathy and social skills, such as "The Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships" by Sherry Schneider or "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. They may also find it helpful to read about how people perceive them and why they perceive them the way they do. This information can be found in books such as "Secrets of Successful Persuasion" by Robert Bly or "The Art of Woo: The Science of Happiness" by Tal Ben-Shahar.

Reading books is a great way to increase understanding. Keep in mind that this is just a prototype of implementing the core objective functions. There are a few steps that come after this, which will be covered in follow-up videos. I will also continue working on improving the training data set. Thank you for watching and have a good day.
