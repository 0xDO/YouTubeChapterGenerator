In this video, David Shapiro explains that he is fine-tuning a model to generate synthetic data for a scene-by-scene simulation of a story. He begins by generating a random scene, then writes a prompt to advance the plot. He fine-tunes another model to take the perspective of a character and generate the next scene. The goal is to have a model that can advance the plot and follow the instructions of the prompt.

What makes a good character? This is a question that every fiction author must ask themselves. A good character is believable and relatable, has a clear motivation, is well-rounded and has both positive and negative qualities, and undergoes believable development in the course of their story.

People don't just pop into existence - a character has a past or backstory. A character has beliefs about themselves, the world, etc. A character has preferences, likes and dislikes, etc. A character has motivations and goals - what do they want today, tomorrow, from life? A character has connections - friends, family, etc.

In order to create believable and relatable characters, we must understand how to stimulate these qualities. One way to do this is by taking a scene and translating it into the main character's first person view. This allows us to focus on the interiority and stream of consciousness of the character, making them more believable and relatable.

The main character in the scene is Sandy. Sandy is a synthetic character that has been generated by a computer. Sandy has a detailed backstory, motivation, beliefs, flaws, strengths, preferences, likes, dislikes, and connections. Sandy is also brave and gullible. Sandy likes the beach and ocean, and is close to her parents and siblings. Sandy also has a lot of friends.

The scene we're generating will be from the character's point of view, so our prompt is to generate a first person point of view. We'll also turn the temperature down because we don't want it to be as creative; we're basically just saying rewrite what is here.

Okay, so then we'll do prompt and this is going to be prompt first person point of view. We don't need the uuid, so we're just going to replace the scene with the scene. So that's this guy right here, and then we're going to do POV equals that, and do uh POV. And this will also instead of that will be file, so just file. And we'll save the POV.

Yes, okay. POV prompt. Prompt first person point of view. Print the POV and save it. And not in scenes, we need to save it in the folder name that I created. Uh, first person point of view. Okay, first person point of view. I think that's good.

So then we'll come back over here, we'll see the character simulation, and then we'll do python generate POV.

It's mid-afternoon and Wayne is taking a break, so probably what I'll do is yeah, so I'm enjoying a cup of tea in my peaceful country cottage when I hear a branch snap. Startled, I look around but there's no one there. But the only thing I see is a deer standing calmly.

Okay, cool. So it changes the scene from third person to first person, which is basically what we're going to do. We're going to set the stage so that we're gonna have the original scene in the next scene will both be first person, and so that will train the model to whatever whatever information we give it generate a first person point of view. Which means that whatever it like, we can put in beliefs and stuff.

So um, one of the next things that we'll do, like I showed just a moment ago, is we will get the character traits. So we can inject character traits into the simulation that will run the first person point of view. We can also generate stuff from the scene and events, inject all of that and run the simulation with these fine-tuned models.

Okay, so I'll go ahead and pause it and let this run. And we will end up with a bunch of first person point of views, a bunch of simulation scenes, and then we'll also get the character traits for these folks.

Okay, going is pretty slow, so I figured I would show you some diagrams while I'm waiting. I've already done the dishes and taken out the trash, so that's how bored I am waiting for this synthetic data to finish.

And you see it's 8:30 in the morning now. Okay, so here's kind of what happens. Or what what I'm planning on happening. There's the character simulation, which is going to be you know, first person. So it's like, this is what I'm doing, this is what I'm thinking, this is what I want. Then there's the scene simulation, which is you know just this the third person, the camera seeing, watching what's happening, other people interacting. And then you can have multiple characters. There's going to be one scene, multiple characters. And then you can inject things like events, beliefs, backstory. Also all kinds of stuff.

So each of these simulations is going to be running in parallel, and then they're going to merge, and then the cycle continues. So actually, let me let me add. So then then it kind of goes back to the beginning. Let's take this over here. So this is how that's going to look. And of course it goes the wrong way that time. So it's just going to be a continuous cycle where you know, so then it advances by one by one step, right? One iteration.

So what what happens inside of the character simulation? So the character simulation is the basic input processing output Loop of Robotics, where you have here's the character has a base personality, which consists of beliefs, identity, history. And this is all their agent model. So you and I have an agent model. AGI has an agent model. A fully realized robot has an agent model, which is why I'm doing this in fiction, because if you can simulate any character, you can also simulate a personality for an AGI.

And so this is how it all relates back to my primary work, which is to create a benevolent AGI or ACOG artificial cognitive entity.

Okay, so there's two basic steps. There's the inner world and the outer world. And so there's input from the outer World, processing, and then output back to the outer world. So you have an agent right here which you know believes, personality, uh, identity, history. And then there's some kind of interaction with the outer world. So an interaction is a two-way street, but to think of it as a loop, it's input processing output.

And so then the the outer world, you know, there will be a series of events, there will be people or other agents. And then there's going to be actions, right? Things that you do to the world, and then stuff that it does back to you. So that's the basic Loop here. And that is the whole purpose of simulating the the character simulation. So this is basically building a fine-tuned model to handle the agent model.

And so that's why we're doing first person point of view, where it's like, okay, um, oh, I had it open somewhere else. I'm gonna Cancel. Uh, so anyways, uh, yeah. So it's like, III, Mimi, this is what I want, this is what I'm thinking, etc, etc. And so that is going to be combined with once I get this.

So this is that's the whole point of the character traits, right? Because a list of character traits is an agent model. Right? For us humans, it's all implicit. That's what we might call ego or super ego or ID. Or your identity or whatever. Those are all just different words to describe who you are as a person. So in fiction, we say like character traits, backstory, personality, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, whatever. All this fun stuff. That's all just an agent model. And so if we have a general purpose agent model, fine-tuned machine, then we can put any agent model we want into it and simulate what it will do. Um, which this will have multiple things. One, we can simulate uh, well, probably not real people. Uh, not with any level of

In this video, David Shapiro discusses the idea of using microservices to create simulations of people for the purpose of testing things like AGI alignment. He argues that this is a more effective way of creating believable simulations than the current method of using text-based descriptions.

Shapiro begins by explaining that writers are used to running simulations of people in their heads. They do this in order to create believable and credible stories. However, the difference between running a simulation in one's head and using an API to connect to a real world is that the latter requires a thinking machine. This is where solipsism and epistemology come into play.

Solipsism is the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is certain to exist. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Shapiro argues that these concepts are important to understand in order to create believable simulations. He goes on to say that once the problem of creating believable simulations of fictional characters is solved, the problem of creating believable simulations of real people will also be solved.

Shapiro concludes by saying that he will continue this discussion in a second video. He plans to discuss character simulation and scene simulation in more detail.
