Hi there, my name is David Shapiro and in this video, I'm going to be talking about a cover letter generator that I made.

This generator is pretty straightforward - it just takes a blob of text and writes a cover letter. I was thinking about whether or not this was ethical, because a cover letter is supposed to be written by you, to a specific company. But I decided that it's just another tool, and there's nothing unethical about using a machine to help you generate a cover letter.

So, if you have a chat log or a rant, the generator can turn it into a cover letter. All you need to do is provide some basic information about yourself and the company you're applying to.

I think this is a really useful tool, especially for people who don't have a lot of experience writing cover letters. It's a quick and easy way to get a well-written letter.

In today's job market, it's more important than ever to have a well-written cover letter. By using a prompt, you can ensure that your cover letter is structured and includes all the important information that potential employers are looking for.

For example, the prompt might ask you to include your strengths, passions, and how you would be a valuable asset to the company. By answering these questions, you can create a cover letter that is both impressive and professional.

If you're not sure how to get started, there are plenty of examples of successful cover letters online. With a little research, you can find a format that works for you and ensure that your cover letter makes a strong impression.
