Hey everybody, David Shapiro here with a new video.

I'm really excited about automuse 3, and I've been getting a lot of questions about it. So I wanted to give an update on where I'm at with it.

The original idea behind automuse 3 was to set up a scene simulation and a character simulation, as a way to test my cognitive architecture work, maragi. But I realized that this approach wouldn't work well for the kind of open-ended, sandbox-style worlds that are good for video games. So I'm still brainstorming that idea, but in the meantime, I've decided to focus on the writing side of things.

One of the goals for automuse 3 is to write long-form fiction, which is something a lot of people want to do but it's very difficult. As I said in a previous video, it takes writers literally years of work to write a novel. So I need to find a way to break down these cognitive tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.

One method of writing stories is the pantser method, where you just sit down and write and see what comes out, without worrying about coherency. I realized that this is what I was doing with automuse, and it worked up to a certain point. But then I got stuck, because the story reached a logical conclusion and I didn't know how to expand it from there.

That's when I realized that the scene simulation and character simulation methods are a form of pantsing. And pantsing is very difficult and messy, so probably won't do that first. That's why I was having such a hard time making progress with the scene simulation and character simulation methods.

So basically, I've got to this point where you start with a premise and then you do the first tier of expansion. But then it requires a different kind of expansion to expand further. That's where I'm at right now.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. Thanks for watching!

The plotter is a tool that helps you create a novel by expanding and refining your story until you have a final product. It is similar to the movie script generator, but with more structure and planning. To get started, you first need to generate a title, theme, setting, characters, and plot.

Today, I'm just going to focus on the first phase of plotting. I'll start by picking a random premise and then generate a title, theme, and setting. I'll use the plotter to expand my story until I'm satisfied, and then refine it. I'll continue to expand and refine my story until I have a complete novel.

The theme of the story is the fight for survival. The human race is in a desperate battle against a hostile alien force, and they are fighting for their very existence. The story is about courage and determination of the human spirit. This is like your typical catastrophe story, and how we will do whatever it takes to survive.

The setting of the story is very different from Earth, and the aliens are very different from humans. Humans are not familiar with the planet and they don't know anything about the aliens. The aliens are curious.

The characters in the story are the crew of the ship, the explorer, and the prisoners of planet X. The crew of the ship is brave and determined to survive. The explorer is curious and wants to learn about the aliens. The prisoners of planet X are different from the humans, and they are also fighting for their survival.

The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT:

 Few characters um yep so we'll come in here and say setting okay list names backstories and personalities so we'll do setting and then we'll do brainstorm characters let's see if this works captain james t kirk no that's called plagiarism um [Music] brainstorm original characters i wonder if the prisoners of planet x is is actually the name of a star trek episode let me check real quick okay no it was the fantastic four um anyways so we'll add in brainstorm original characters for the following story so we'll say original unique not used before all right this is definitely going to take yeah even even with a temperature of 1 it's also just like constantly generating james t kirk yep all right oh boy this is definitely gonna require fine tuning that's fine um brainstorm original characters for the following story list names backstories and personalities um it does do a list so that's nice um let's see characters um so then we do title here you don't need to watch this part this is boring boring all right let's run this again see if we get some characters and we're almost done yeah plot so plot will be like just list everything out that happens and again using um using instruct series is not very creative um it was very much yeah okay a space shuttle carrying a team of scientists the survivalist um the planet is located in a remote galaxy atmosphere is toxic and incredibly hot the creature is the only living thing okay characters john the team leader no nonsense type of guy karen david uh the creature okay yeah so we got some we got some characters so that's good that's good that's good um we'll go with that for now again this is just like this is minimum viable product obviously all these names are like um what like not not just like white people names these are white american names um so we're going to need to get a little bit more creative and generative with this and also with in the brainstorming phase um you really want to um see a little bit more creativity so like when you're when you're talking about the setting you really want to expand on on that and kind of come up with unique ideas this like i said this is going to take fine tuning but another thing to think about is okay we take a premise and then we expand on it but then we can expand on each of these right so like well i guess title you don't need to expand on that but theme like you can just write a like write a litany on theme um you can write a whole bunch about settings so i might actually do that where we've got like layer one of the setting and then like let's iterate on it again um in the future versions where you just like let's write a few pages about the setting and then let's write a few pages about each character and then like a few pages of the plot um so it might be like phase one is just get it something on paper oh i've meant to tell you this so there is a rule of thumb in writing which is you cannot edit an empty page so that's why it's just like let's go as fast as possible we'll worry about refinement later because once you've got something that you can edit then you can make it better so it doesn't matter if it's generic if it's boilerplate or whatever because you make it better over time and that's this that's this recursive this iterative loop that we'll get to but um what i'm thinking is that it almost might be that we need to iterate starting here but i also don't want to get too far ahead of myself because reasons uh let's see zoom 100 so whoops that's not what i meant to do make that a little bit bigger okay zoom fit there we go okay so yeah and then we'll just send this to back um order send to back okay make this a slightly different color so it stands out yeah there we go there we go okay so we might need these like iterative loops um so that we can um refine it over time all right i'm getting distracted let's carry on um where was i where was i uh okay so we got characters now the last thing is we need to generate some plot generate some plot all right i'll pause it do a little bit of prompt engineering and we'll be right back okay first first pass of this is uh brainstorm a highly detailed plot outline list all the story beats and sequence and describe each plot element with a few sentences so this one that we were working on where it's just kind of the generic like creature movie the team arrives on the planet and begins to explore that's not a few sentences curse you instruct series model uh they find the creature and are immediately intrigued by it um they begin to study the creature and quickly realize that that it is immune to the conditions of the planet you don't say um they soon discover that the creature is trying to learn about them the team begins to understand the creature and they come to realize that it is intelligent they also realize that the creature is the only living thing on the planet the team begins to feel sympathy for the creature and they decide to help it they find a way to take the creature off the planet and give it a new home okay so there's no reversal there's no um you know like okay this is like this would be a good short story but that's okay because again we generated something we can make it better over time so let's go ahead and copy this out i'll go ahead and pause it you don't need to see me cleaning this up this prompt works good enough and we'll probably call it a day we're already at 30 minutes all right let's go for the final test of the day a small town in japan a young woman is found dead the black feather mystery ooh ooh ooh good the theme of this story is the power of determination okay good the story said in a small town in japan typical uh japanese town climate is temperate okay yeah traditional businesses uh naomi tanaka the sister of the woman that was murdered great that's a lot of characters um and then finally the plot um outline naomi tanaka is a private detective oh the sister okay she teams up with the local journalist hiroshi nakamura um

Naomi Tanaka is a private detective in a small town in Japan. Her sister was recently murdered, so she teams up with the local journalist, Hiroshi Nakamura, to solve the case.

They discover that the victim was killed with a black feather, which leads them to a local shrine. There, they meet the priestess, who tells them that the feathers are used in a ritual to summon a vengeful spirit.

Naomi and Hiroshi realize that they need to find the person who performed the ritual in order to stop the spirit from killing again. They eventually discover that the culprit is the victim's husband, who was trying to get rid of her in order to inherit her family's fortune.

With the help of the priestess, they are able to stop the husband and save the town.

The police are investigating a case, and it seems that the GPT3 instruction series does a little better with it. It seems like the series doesn't like sci-fi as much because this is a real plot.

One thing that I noticed is that, especially when we do lists, we need to disable the thing that I have here. I'll just go ahead and remove the resub. This will compress anything so that it removes excess vertical white space or just excess white space in general.

I think tomorrow or whenever I come back to this, we're going to loop through this again. We'll try and make each setting or each item a little bit better. We'll iterate on the characters, the plot, and the setting. We might also start doing some fine tuning.

 Given the following theme, expand upon this idea and explore the humanity and the philosophy of the scene.

More motivated by a desire for justice, she wants to understand. She is determined to find out the truth even if it means going up against powerful forces.

The theme here is that you want the truth no matter what, no matter how dangerous it might be.
