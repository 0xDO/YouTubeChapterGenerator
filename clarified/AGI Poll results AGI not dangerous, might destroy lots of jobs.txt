What are people's thoughts on the likelihood of automation permanently displacing many or most workers within the next 20 years? This is something I've been wondering about, and I thought I'd share some unscientific poll results.

According to the poll, a third of people believe that zero to 25% of workers will be displaced by automation. Another fifth believe that 25 to 50% will be displaced, and a full quarter believe that 50 to 75% of workers will lose their jobs to automation. These results are much higher than I anticipated.

I'm curious to know what people think about this issue. Please leave a comment and let me know your thoughts. Do you believe that AGI (artificial general intelligence) or automation will permanently dislocate many workers within the next 20 years?
