Context augmentation is a process of adding additional information to a given context in order to change its meaning or propose different actions. For example, imagine a child who is angry and has thrown several blocks. With no additional information, we might assume that the child is hungry or tired. However, if we add the information that the child has struggled with building blocks in the past due to fine motor development issues, we can see that the child's anger is likely due to frustration, and we can propose the action of fetching the child's mother to do some fine motor skill exercises with him.

Encyclopedic augmentation is another form of context augmentation, where additional information is added from an external source, such as an article from the internet. For example, if we take the context of an angry child and search for information about anger in children, we might find an article that discusses different triggers for anger, such as frustration or other mental health conditions. This additional information can help us better understand the child's anger and propose more helpful actions.

In this video, I demonstrated how adding contextual information can improve the performance of an artificial intelligence system. I showed how, by augmenting the context in which a problem is presented to the system, we can get better results. In particular, I showed how adding information about a child's developmental issues can improve the system's ability to generate actions that would help the child. This is a powerful result, as it shows how context augmentation can improve the performance of AI systems in cases where there is limited information.
