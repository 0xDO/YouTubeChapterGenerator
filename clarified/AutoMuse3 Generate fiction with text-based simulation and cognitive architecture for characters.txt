In this video, David Shapiro revisits the Auto Muse project, which is an AI-assisted novel-writing tool. He demonstrates how the tool works by showing how it generates a summary of the story so far, sets the scene, and then does dialogue between characters. The tool is designed to be iterative, so that each time it runs, it improves the story. However, Shapiro notes that the tool is still repetitive and needs some work.

In this video, David Shapiro discusses his latest project: a story writing simulator that runs various simulations in order to generate a story. He demonstrates how the simulator works and how it produces a story. Although the story is not particularly compelling at this stage, Shapiro believes that this is a promising direction for story writing.
