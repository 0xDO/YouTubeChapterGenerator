Microservices are a way of breaking software into independent chunks. The old school way of building software was to have a monolithic application where all the software was put together in the same executable file or in the same server. However, as applications got bigger, it became difficult to manage them. Breaking the software into smaller chunks makes it easier to build and maintain.

The primary reason for using microservices is that they are easier to build and maintain. They are also more flexible and can evolve over time. Microservices were pioneered by amazon in a big way. Once the amazon platform got too big, they started breaking it down into smaller components.

Some of the key benefits of microservices include being able to use any language, being able to have continuous delivery, and being more scalable.

There are twelve main regions of the brain, each with specialized purposes. The regions are the brain stem, the primitive reptile brain, the mammalian midbrain, and the human neocortex. The cerebellum helps coordinate complex motions. Alcoholism can shrink the cerebellum. Brain diseases and injuries show that the brain is not monolithic. A lesion in one part of the brain can cause loss of function in that specific area. Head injuries can cause acute amnesia, loss of speech, or paralysis. Visual neglect can cause prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The interconnectedness of the brain regions resembles a microservices architecture. The brain regions can function quasi-independently. Work is being done to copy the brain in order to create machine intelligence. Neural networks are modeled after the human brain and are the smartest machines currently in existence.

At the macroscopic level, the whole brain is the primary focus. This is because a virtual neural network or an artificial neural network can be trained to have the equivalent of a thousand neurons. However, the human brain has about 90 billion neurons. This means that the virtual network is still a few orders of magnitude off from being able to replicate the human brain. There are two primary ways to model the brain: the structural model and the functional model. The structural model is where you copy the regions and connectivity of the brain. This is what is known as whole brain simulation. The functional model is where you identify discrete functions of the brain, such as memory, learning, visual processing, and morality. The functional model is more difficult to replicate, but it is also more ethical. This is because, in a whole brain simulation, a brain in a jar would be panicking because it would have no body and no way to breathe. The functional model is the preferred model because it does not require reconstruction of the brain with 400 million or 3.5 billion years of evolution. Instead, it can be designed from the ground up. The microservices architecture of the brain would be similar to a software application, with input, output, and executive functions. Input would be sensations, but for a machine, there could be other kinds of input, such as the ability to talk to the web or other machines. Output would be actions, such as controlling peripheral devices or speaking. Executive functions would be responsible for task selection and task switching. The ability to think years, decades, or centuries into the future is unique to humans and is made possible by the prefrontal cortex.

Microservices are a way to build software that is more modular and scalable. Moragi is a microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence (AGI). I invented it in July 2018, and it is four years old this month.

The original experiments I did with Moragi were with Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP). I later switched to Representational State Transfer (REST) because it is more lightweight and does not require a broker. Moragi was originally multimodal, meaning that it could take pictures and audio clips as input. I later realized that once you get into the core thought module of an artificial cognitive entity, it should have one modality, and I chose natural language because it is interpretable and transparent.

The latest version of Moragi is more organized, with a central nexus that everything orbits around. The nexus houses the stream of consciousness for the machine. This is a thought first model, meaning that the nexus is the conscious component, while the other services would be the unconscious mind.
