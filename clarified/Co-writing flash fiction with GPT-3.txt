In this video, David Shapiro discusses co-writing with GPT3. Co-writing is a process where you provide a little bit of framing and then let the computer assist you in writing a story. In this example, Steve Hadley is a test pilot who is stranded on a Martian transit vessel. The ship is falling out of orbit and is going to crash into the surface of Mars. Steve tries to figure out a way to survive, but the computer points out that there is no way to survive the crash. However, Steve remembers an incident from his academy days where his friend Jonah had used the ship's propulsion to slow their descent. Steve tries to do the same, but the computer points out that he doesn't have enough fuel. However, Steve is able to use the ship's attitude thrusters to slow down the descent and the ship lands successfully.

In 2014, aerospace engineer David Shapiro and GPTH3 co-wrote a short story called "The Martian Transit." The story is about a man named Steve who is involved in a space accident. The lead ground crewman tells Steve that they were expecting to find a dead body, but instead Steve is alive and well. Steve is surprised to find out that chaos theory is at play.

The story is set on a space ship and is about 1000 words long. It is a speculative fiction and thriller. The story ends with the lead ground crewman telling Steve that he should consider a different line of work.
