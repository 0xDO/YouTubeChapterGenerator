David Shapiro discusses his predictions for the future of AI jobs. He believes that there will be a surge in the hiring of humanities majors, as they are better equipped to understand and utilize large language models. Additionally, he predicts that automation will increasingly take over many jobs that are currently done by humans, including law.

The law industry is undergoing major changes with the advent of automation. One of the biggest changes will be in the way that contracts are negotiated. Currently, most contracts are negotiated manually by lawyers, which can be a very time-consuming and expensive process. However, with the use of automation tools, this process can be greatly streamlined.

One tool that is already being used to automate contract negotiation is GPT3. This tool can summarize a contract for you, so that you can more easily understand it. Additionally, it can also help to automate the contract revision process, which can save a lot of time and money.

One of the biggest benefits of using automation in the law industry is that it can help to speed up the negotiation process. This is because you can have two machines working adversarially to negotiate a contract, rather than having a lawyer do it manually. Additionally, it can also help to make contracts more specific and longer, as it is easy to add clauses with the help of automation.

Overall, the use of automation in the law industry is going to have a major impact on the way that contracts are negotiated. It is important to keep up with these changes so that you can be prepared for them.
