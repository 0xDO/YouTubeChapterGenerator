Good morning, everyone. This is David Shapiro with a quick video.

A few days ago, I started my Discord server at the request of many people. In just a few days, I have over 80 members. I was expecting maybe a dozen people, but this is a wonderful problem to have. It far outstrips anything I had expected. And I'm quickly learning about how to organize a community this large.

One thing I wanted to do while doing an audio test (because we're going to do a podcast) was to give a quick tutorial about threads. Threads are a great way to keep conversations organized, especially in a large server like this.

To start a thread, you just hit the hashtag with the little comment button. Type in a title for your thread, and it will create a sidebar conversation. You can also rename the thread, leave it, mute it, or edit it.

If you're not participating in a thread, you can click on "Active Threads" to see all of the threads that are currently active. Or, if you remember that there's a thread in a particular channel, you can go to that channel and click on the "Threads" button to see just the threads in that channel.

Finally, to see pinned messages, you can click on the "Pinned" button at the top of the page.

I hope this quick tutorial was helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Discord server.

The Cognitive AI Lab Discord server is a community of people interested in discussing AI and its implications. The server has been set up so that people can share their thoughts and ideas in a structured way, with three phases to each discussion: presentation, round-robin, and free-for-all.

The presentation phase is where one person talks or presents on a topic for 5-15 minutes. This is followed by a round-robin phase where everyone gets to share their thoughts and reactions to the presentation, one at a time. This ensures that everyone gets a chance to speak, without people talking over each other. After everyone has had a chance to talk, the discussion moves on to the free-for-all phase, where anything goes.

This structure makes it safe and accessible for everyone to participate, regardless of their level of experience or expertise. It also means that the discussion can be more focused and productive, as people are not interrupted or sidetracked.
