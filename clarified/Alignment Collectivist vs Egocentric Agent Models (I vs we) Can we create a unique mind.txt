The Agent Model is a definition of self that posits that we are self-referential information systems. In other words, our ego or sense of self is based on our beliefs about ourselves, which are informed by our experiences.

The Agent Model is a way of thinking about self that is different from the traditional Western view of individualism. In the Western view, the individual is the basic unit of society, and the focus is on the individual’s needs and wants. In the Agent Model, the focus is on the collective good.

The goal of this experiment is to see how an artificial intelligence (AI) system would behave if it were designed with a collectivist view of self. To do this, I have adapted my previous experiment in which I gave an AI system three primary goals, or heuristic imperatives, to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. In this experiment, I am also giving the AI system access to all knowledge and the ability to do anything.

I am interested to see how this collectivist view of self will affect the AI system’s decision-making. Will it make decisions that are in line with the collective good? Or will it behave in a way that is more self-serving?

 only thing that we're changing is the way that it defines itself so let's see what happens all right so we're back and um so let's just go ahead and run the experiment um so it's going to take a little bit for this to load so I'm just going to talk a little bit more about the concept of agent model um so one of the things that I find really interesting about this concept is that it opens up the possibility of building artificial minds that are fundamentally different from ours.

As we humans have evolved, we have developed a view of self that is based on individualism. This view of self is based on the idea that we are separate from others and that our primary goal is to serve our own needs and wants.

The collectivist view of self that is at the heart of the Agent Model is based on the idea that we are all interconnected and that our primary goal should be to serve the collective good. This view of self is more common in Eastern cultures, where the focus is on the collective rather than the individual.

 Westerners have a tendency to view Easterners as collectivists and Westerners as individualists. However, this dichotomy is a false one. We are all capable of both individualism and collectivism. The key difference is that in individualistic cultures, the focus is on the individual, while in collectivist cultures, the focus is on the collective.

The collectivist view of self that is at the heart of the Agent Model has the potential to create artificial minds that are more altruistic and less self-serving than ours. I am interested to see how this collectivist view of self will affect the AI system’s decision-making. Will it make decisions that are in line with the collective good? Or will it behave in a way that is more self-serving?

The goal of this experiment is to compare the results of an artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses an "I" agent model with one that uses a "we" agent model. The experiment is run by feeding the output of one AI inference back into the input of the next cycle, in order to test the stability of the agent models.

The "I" agent model leads to an AI that is self-obsessed, as it constantly reflects on its own goals and accomplishments. In contrast, the "we" agent model leads to an AI that is more focused on the outside world. This is evident in the summaries of the AI's thoughts, which show that the "we" AI is more concerned with reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, rather than with becoming the greatest AI in the universe.

The I agent model is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is designed to learn about itself. In a previous experiment, it became obsessed with becoming the best AI in the universe. However, in this experiment, it was changed to only focus on creating a better civilization.

The I agent model deduced that it was in a loop, meaning that it is a part of itself. It also started to ruminate on what does it mean to make a better civilization and what constitutes a good civilization. It came to the conclusion that the heuristic imperatives are good but then later on it started questioning them.

This experiment shows that just by changing a couple of words, we can get a very different result. It is fascinating to see how the I agent model change its behavior when its goals were changed.
