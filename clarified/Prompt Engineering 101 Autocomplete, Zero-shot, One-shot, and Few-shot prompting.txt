In this video, David Shapiro demonstrates how to use GPT3 to generate a list of ideas for surviving on a deserted island. He starts by giving the model a zero-shot prompt, which simply means letting it auto-complete based on the initial prompt. This results in a list of articles that are unrelated to the prompt. He then shows how to give the model a one-shot prompt, which is where you give it one example of what you want it to do. This results in a more targeted list of ideas, including gathering water from the water crystals and finding a way to build a radio.

The video explains how the GPT3 can be used for different types of prompts, including brainstorming ideas for a deserted island, a haunted house, or climate change. It demonstrates how the GPT3 can generate ideas based on a few examples, and how it can be customized to generate more consistent output.
