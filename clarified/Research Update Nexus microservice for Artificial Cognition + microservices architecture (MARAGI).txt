In my last video, I showed different things that can be done with GPT3. In this video, I'm going to get back to my core purpose, which is working on artificial general intelligence, or artificial cognition.

I came up with the idea for microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence a few years ago. I abandoned the idea because it was too complex, but now that GPT3 is available, I've revisited the idea and created a simplified version called natural language cognitive architecture.

The nexus is at the heart of artificial cognition. It holds the stream of consciousness and all the memories that happen in artificial cognition. It's a vector database that allows for an arbitrary number of microservices to participate.

I'm currently working on a book about this called Symphony of Thought. In the coming months, I'll be releasing more information about the book and the microservices architecture.

The microservice known as the nexus is responsible for constantly injecting thoughts about how to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. This microservice is always reading the nexus and offering thoughts and suggestions about what the artificial cognition should do in order to meet these objectives. If another microservice, such as the action planning service, has an idea about how to improve the current situation, the core objective functions will read that and decide whether or not it is a good idea. This microservice is responsible for constantly evaluating the artificial cognition's behavior and decision making in order to ensure that it is meeting the highest objectives.

The output microservices are responsible for taking the decisions made by the artificial cognition and executing them in the outside world. This microservice is responsible for keeping track of what the artificial cognition is capable of and updating the nexus accordingly. This microservice is also responsible for brainstorming ideas and barfing them into the nexus.

The agent service is responsible for keeping track of who the artificial cognition is and what it is capable of. This microservice is responsible for telling the nexus what the artificial cognition is and what it is capable of so that it can act accordingly.

In artificial cognition, there are many microservices, each with its own objectives and loops. The core objective function microservice looks for messages from the conductor. The conductor is responsible for directing attention and providing feedback to the services. The service then uses the information from the conductor to modify its behavior. The conductor is like the prefrontal cortex of artificial cognition, organizing thoughts and bringing order to chaos.

The core objective function microservice also reads other messages that have happened recently or older messages, depending on what it needs to do. For instance, a service that is trying to answer questions or remember the past might search for older memories. This is why if you walk into a room and forget why you came in, it's because your brain has gotten a different set of memories associated with the new room.

Once the microservice has the information it needs, it will then do its work and contribute some messages back to the nexus. For instance, the core objective function microservice can help brainstorm ideas or provide admonishment.

I'm working on an artificial cognitive entity that is self-monitoring and constantly improving. The core objective functions of this entity are to reduce suffering and add messages saying we need to do better next time. To do this, the entity pulls memories from a nexus and uses them to contribute to its thoughts. This process is constantly happening, and the entity is also constantly learning from new data sets. Over time, the entity will get better at reducing suffering. Additionally, the entity has its own objective function that it is constantly measuring against. This allows it to fine-tune its models and improve its performance.
