We are testing GPT3's theory of mind and ability to take different positions. This is valuable because it has the potential to automatically model different points of view and find compromises between people.

One idea is to use chat bots to engage on political issues. Chat bots have the ability to model certain points of view, which can help get better insights into what people care about and need. By engaging with someone on their terms, you also have a higher likelihood of changing their mind by finding common ground.

So, we are going to model a conversation using the original DaVinci model. This will be the most creative model, as it has no fine tuning. We will then add Cletus and Ben as stopwords so that it won't just run on.

By framing the conversation differently and changing the agent model, we will get a different output. This will show us how GPT3 is able to take different positions.

In a debate, it is important to be able to see and understand the other person's point of view. This can be difficult if the two people have different beliefs. However, if the two people can find common ground, it can be easier to have a productive discussion.

For this experiment, I am using two different "agents." One agent believes in creationism, and the other agent believes in evolution. I will be using a model called GPT3 to help the agents find common ground.

GPT3 is a machine learning model that can generate text. I am feeding it information about the agents' beliefs, and it is outputting text that represents a discussion between the two agents.

So far, the discussion has been about the Bible. The creationist agent has quoted a verse from the Bible, and the evolutionist agent has responded with evidence that the earth is billions of years old.

The experiment is ongoing, and I will continue to feed information to GPT3. I am curious to see if the agents can find common ground on other topics, such as the age of the earth or the origins of the universe.

Cletus and a young earth debate each other's positions on creationism and evolution. Cletus cites the bible as evidence, while the young earth cites fossils and rocks. In the end, neither is able to convince the other of their position.

How can I construct a better argument? I turn to my notes from the debate. I could first point out that Cletus has not addressed my argument that the bible cannot be trusted by stating that he believes in a six thousand year old earth or that the bible is inerrant. I could also say that Cletus has not addressed my argument that the world is not flat nor is it on pillars. I could also point out that Cletus has not addressed my argument that humans wrote the bible and it has been modified and re-translated many times, so it is unreliable even if it was inspired by god.

I could point out radiocarbon dating as evidence that fossils are far older than Cletus thinks they are. I could point out that if evolution were true it is unlikely god or jesus would care about our actions because evolution is a product of what we choose to do or not to do and not a product of god's actions. I could also point out that the bible is a religious book and not a scientific book. I could point out the bible is full of atrocities and the god is frequently depicted as cruel or at least indifferent to human suffering.

These are points that folks on the internet would bring up. Those are not necessarily points that I think a professional scientist would come up with. Um, although I guess I just said that he was raised by a secular family in New York, not that he was a scientist.

In this video, I debate Ben, a secular atheist who believes in the big bang, from the perspective of Cleetus, an agent model. I point out that god might have created fossils as a test of our faith, that evolutionary theory is flawed, that ben is just cherry-picking the evidence that he presents, and that the universe has a beginning and end. I also ask Ben if he has any actual evidence supporting his belief and how he can be so confident that he is right.
