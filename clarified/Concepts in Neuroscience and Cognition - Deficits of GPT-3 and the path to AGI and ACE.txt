The task set size effect is the finding that performance on a task set decreases as the number of tasks increases. This effect is believed to be due to the fact that individuals have limited amounts of attention and working memory, which are necessary for completing multiple tasks simultaneously. The task set size effect has important implications for real world settings such as workplaces, where individuals often have to complete multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, the effect suggests that it is more difficult to complete multiple tasks when there are more tasks in the set.

Cognitive control refers to the ability to regulate one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in order to achieve a desired goal. This regulation occurs through the use of higher order cognitive processes such as attention, working memory, and inhibitory control.

Cognitive control is largely mediated by the prefrontal cortex, which is why we have forward foreheads rather than sloping foreheads like gorillas. This is our command center. Disruptions to cognitive control can lead to problems with attention, decision making, and impulse control.

Cognitive control is an important part of everyday life. It allows us to set and achieve goals, resist temptation, and override impulses. However, disruptions to cognitive control can lead to serious problems.

One way to overcome these problems is to develop a sense of identity, or self-awareness. This can be done by training the brain to differentiate between itself and the rest of the world. The default mode network is a set of brain regions that are active when a person is not actively engaged in a task. The default mode network is thought to be involved in self-awareness and can help people to overcome disruptions to cognitive control.

Studies show that the prefrontal cortex and limbic system work together to allow us to quickly assess a situation and make a decision based on our previous experiences. This is what is known as intuition. Intuition is a form of pattern recognition that allows us to make quick decisions based on limited information. Intuition is thought to be mediated by a network of regions in the brain, including the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher-level thinking and decision making, while the limbic system is responsible for emotional processing. Together, these regions allow us to quickly assess a situation and make a decision based on our previous experiences. Although intuition is often more accurate than conscious reasoning, it is more likely to lead to errors when the situation is complex or unfamiliar.

Intuition is a powerful tool that can help us make better decisions. However, we should not rely on intuition alone. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that humans can use to make decisions. The study of heuristics is important for understanding how humans make decisions. Heuristics can help us to understand why people sometimes make irrational decisions. Heuristics can also help us to design better decision-making systems.
