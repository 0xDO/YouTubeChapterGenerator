The Inflation Reduction Act was recently released, and it is a large and comprehensive bill. I summarized it using my recursive summarizer, which breaks it down into 2000 character chunks and then summarizes each chunk.

The act contains many tax credits, extensions of older tax credits, and provisions for Medicare and other medical care. It is very comprehensive, but there may be some things hidden in the bill that are not immediately apparent.

I will continue to run my summarizer on the bill until it is more concise and manageable. All of the summary files will be available on my GitHub repository.
