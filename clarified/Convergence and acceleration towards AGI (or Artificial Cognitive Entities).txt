As we continue to make progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming increasingly apparent that we are moving closer and closer to achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is evident in the recent convergence of ideas among AI researchers regarding how to best build an intelligent machine.

One example of this is the idea of a "composable architecture" or "composable cognition." This is the idea that an AI system should be composed of many smaller, specialized modules that each handle a specific task. This approach is similar to that used in the brain, where different regions are responsible for different functions.

Multiple researchers are independently coming to the conclusion that a composable architecture is the best way to build an AGI system. This is a strong indication that we are moving closer to a consensus on how to achieve AGI.

Another example is the recent progress being made on building robots that are controlled by artificial cognitive architectures. This is an area of research that I am deeply involved in, and it is exciting to see the rapid progress being made.

Google Flamingo is a good example of this. Flamingo is a robot that is controlled by an artificial cognitive architecture. This is exactly what I proposed in my book "Natural Language Cognitive Architecture." The cognitive architecture is responsible for processing natural language, and the robot is able to improvise and behave in an open-ended fashion thanks to the iterative recursive loops of behavior that are possible with this approach.

As more and more thought leaders are saying, AI and automation are going to be the most important technologies that we ever create. Intelligent machines are the final invention of humanity, and it is crucial that we get it right. I am glad to see that there is a growing consensus among AI researchers regarding how to achieve AGI. We are all working together to make this a reality, and I believe that we are closer than anyone realizes.
