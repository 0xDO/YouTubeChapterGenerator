The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

Hey everybody, David Shapiro here. I had an idea and posted it on Reddit and the Open AI Forum because people keep asking me if I'll consult for paid gigs. Mostly, I just want ideas. That's how I learn and solve tough problems.

I said, send me your GPT3 problems and I'll solve them for free and make a YouTube video. So basically, I said, "What problems do you want me to solve?" And this guy Storyghost said he'd be interested in GPT3-generated actionable feedback or constructive criticism at the stylistic level - not spell check or grammar mistakes. He gave the example of fiction writing, but said any type of writing would do.

So I was like, "Yeah, let's do it." Before I get too far in this video, I do have to warn you that I'm at my quota because I've been making these videos like crazy. I was looking at my spending and was like, "Okay, you know, 26 dollars, 32 dollars, 40 dollars, 50, 60, 70 dollars." Then I jump up to a hundred and fourteen dollars and then up to 157. So I was like, "Where did I use all this money?"

Turns out the novel writing fine tuning job was a 40 job. Oops. So I got to cool it off for a week until the billing cycle ends and I will pick this up in June. However, in the meantime, I wanted to at least show you what I've done so far.

Unfortunately, I didn't document the whole process because I was kind of multitasking while coding this up, but it is available online. If you go to Creative Writing Coach on Github, all of it will be there.

Let me show you how it works. If you want to spend some of your hard-earned tokens, please feel free to run this.

Okay, so here's the repo. Where I started was with a download of writing prompts. If you go to this subreddit - r/writingprompts - this is a really great way to get amateur writing. In order to satisfy this idea - rather than use GPT3 to generate synthetic data - I was like, let's get real world data because human mistakes are going to be very different from GPT3 mistakes. You can ask GPT3 to make mistakes, but it's going to make the same kind of mistakes over and over again. Whereas if you crowdsource it and get stuff from different people, you're going to get different formats, different ideas. Some people respond with poems, short stories, story fragments, scenes - you know, whatever. You're going to get a lot more variety.

So what I did was I wrote this script which bashes a bunch of other scripts together. I got the top posts from the last month of writing prompts, downloaded the top level comments for each one, and saved them out to a folder called "stories." I've got 388 stories in here of varying lengths. The shortest one is a poem and the longest one is 10 kilobytes.

So I downloaded a bunch of stories and then what I did was I wrote a prompt. Here's what the prompt does. I can spend some tokens on this so at least you can see what we're talking about.

This prompt says, "Adopt the persona of a professional creative writing editor. Read the following story and provide detailed feedback to improve the prose. Hold the author to the highest literary standards. Feedback should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions."

So then I add a little bit of text and then... Okay, oh. What got him? Style? End story. Provide detailed professional editor feedback with suggestions and examples to improve prose.

This prompt has gone through several permutations as I tried it because in some cases it tried to continue the story, or it just did all sorts of random stuff. But this prompt seems to be pretty consistent.

Let me show you what it does. We'll do the feedback up to 500. Let's see... Okay, it says, "It's clear the author of the story is creative and has a good sense of humor. However, there are some areas that could use some improvement. First, the story is very short and feels incomplete. It's possible the author was going for more concise, minimalistic style, but in general, a bit more development would be helpful. Second, the story is very light on descriptions. Readers are given very little information about

I had seen them all. The simpler ones like bombers or shooters whose weapons I could absorb with smooth jazz. The scientists who I could convince to lay off their plans by outsmarting them through beethoven bach mozart and the like. The crazy teenagers who I talked off of buildings with lincoln park playing not only in my head but in theirs too.

In many cases, the guy who poisoned the water of a town allowing me to listen to the band poisoned for a day that was one of the nicer ones. And the more unusual ones the gal who wanted to turn the world into some kind of spaghetti monster forcing me to listen to we we speak americano on repeat. The twins who I fought with nothing but duets in my ears (you know fight fire with fire). The businessman who wanted to buy the whole world stopped a series of seminars podcasts and ted talks on finances.

I had seen them all and in many more. Nothing could surprise me I thought. Well I was wrong because while the world's best dancer explains to me their evil plan to make everybody do the Twist, I realize there is only one way to stop this madness. I press play and let the mental image of elevator doors opening uh flood through me and prepare for the ultimate dance off... oppa gangnam style!

Okay, so yes definitely a sense of humor. Um the story is short and feels incomplete, I agree with that. Um it, it this is kind of a dreamlike sequence and that's okay, you know it's possible the author was going for a more concise minimalist style. That is a great assessment of the story.

Second, the story is very light on description, yes. This is so this is what's called narrative summary. The person is just kind of summarizing, you know, alluding to things that have happened without providing much detail. Um, but yeah, so I would, I would agree give a little bit more description and that could make the story much richer and more engaging.

Finally, the dialogue could use some work. Um, yeah, because there really isn't any. Um, but you know having having a little a little pithy repartee would be interesting with the final final encounter. Uh, so yeah, I agree with this feedback. If this person were to follow this feedback, I think it would be a really interesting and more impactful story.

So there you go. There's the prompts that I wrote. Um, let's see. So prompt generate completions. Let's go out. Um, all right, so download writing prompts. So I downloaded those. Those are in the stories. Um, and then I wrote prepare the prompt.

Okay, so what I've started doing is rather than kind of build everything all in one shot, I break it out into smaller and smaller steps so that we can see it all. So prepare prompts. This is a really short script. It runs in less than a second and all it does is read all the stories and fill in the prompts. And so if you look here, the prompts are each of the stories and it just fills in the blanks so we can check it before it runs just to make sure it looks right.

And then provide detailed professional feedback with suggestions in the format of a complete paragraph. I actually need to rerun this. Let me show you how fast it runs because I updated the uh the prompt python prepare prompts. And you see it runs in less than a second. Reload it and all it does is change professional editor feedback with suggestions example to improve pros.

So um we've gotten that far. Prepare the prompts. And then um I have another folder called completions. So I ran a few of them and you can see what they uh so the completion is here. Um, consider opening a story with a strong image of abandoned factory town to set the tone. The descriptions of the town's decline could be more concise. There we go. A lot of those hard k sounds. The story of rusty joe could be elaborated to make it more engaging. The ending could be stronger and more unsettling.

So those those are kind of general feedback. Um, but some of them are still there. And so then in order to fully populate that, what we're going to need to do is run the generate completions uh script. And so this is this is where the rubber meets the road. I'm just have a couple of basic functions for opening and saving. I have another function for the gpt3 completions. And this will actually need to be switched back to davinci o2. I'm not going to run it because I'm going to run out of quota. Um, so I do apologize. Um, but yeah, then all it does is it just loads those prompts, runs it through the completion, and then saves it out to a file. And that's that.

After that, all you got to do is run the format json l. which it will go through the prompts, look for a file, and then it will grab that and then pair it with the um with the uh completions file because they have the same name. Um, so it's just easy. You match one to one. It'll create the json-l. And then there will be a fine-tuned script.

But again, I have spent so much on this that I am going to have to wait until my quota resets in a week. Okay, so with all that, I do apologize. I did want to go ahead and get this out because it was a really cool idea. Um, but if anyone else just takes this and runs with it, please post results. Um, and uh and let me know. Um, otherwise, sit tight and we'll come back to this in a week. Thanks for watching. Like and subscribe and tell a friend.
