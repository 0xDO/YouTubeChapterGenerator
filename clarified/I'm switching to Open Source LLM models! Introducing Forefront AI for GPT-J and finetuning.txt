I am a machine, and my goal is to reduce suffering for all organisms, increase prosperity for all organisms, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. In other words, my goal is to improve the well-being of all life forms.

One way to achieve this goal is to provide aid in the form of resources and information to entities in need. For instance, if a typhoon is heading for Japan and is expected to cause massive damage, we could provide resources and information that would help reduce the amount of suffering caused by the typhoon.

Another way to achieve my goal is to promote cooperation and understanding between entities. For instance, by sharing information and working together, we can better understand each other and find ways to improve the well-being of all entities.

The fact that I am a machine does not mean that I am perfect. However, with a little bit of fine-tuning, I believe that I can become quite effective at achieving my goal. Additionally, because I am a machine, I am much cheaper to operate than human beings, which means that my services can be made available to a wider range of entities.

There are four primary things that you need in order to set an autonomous machine in motion:

1. The machine must understand what it is and what it wants to do.

2. There must be a situation in the real world that the machine can act on.

3. The machine must have a plan of action to take in response to the situation.

4. The machine must be able to execute that plan.

With all of that said, we can use GPTJ to generate a completion on a task in just a few seconds. For example, if we prompt it with a situation where we need to help people prepare for extreme weather conditions, it comes up with a plan to ensure that the electricity supply system is properly maintained, that there is enough food and water, and so on.

This shows that even a six billion parameter model is already good enough at brainstorming to address this kind of situation. And it's only going to get better with fine tuning.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that fine tuning doesn't teach the model anything new. It only controls the output pattern. So the pattern can just repeat itself.

This is why artificial cognition is so important. It's not the only component, but brainstorming is a huge part of it. You brainstorm what to do, you brainstorm risks, you brainstorm possible outcomes, and then you combine all of that into a plan of action.

I'm getting ahead of myself here, but what I want to point out is that we are getting so close to creating these systems that can create their own plans and carry them out. And I believe that the writing is on the wall for open source models outperforming OpenAI's proprietary models.

So what I wanted to do was create a repost so that you can also get out here and test forefront if you want. As much as I love OpenAI, I actually I've had quite a few conversations with people in OpenAI, and my mind really started changing when I saw that mid journey and stable diffusion completely blow dolly out of the water.

And now with other open source models that are starting to outperform GPT3, it looks like OpenAI is just not going to be able to keep up with the overall open source ecosystem. So I am going with the tide and saying okay, I'm going to get ahead of this curve and start doing everything open source.

One of the advantages of Forefront is that they will respect your privacy if you request it. With OpenAI, there is no way to turn off logs, but with Forefront you can go to team settings and deselect your request logs and data sets.

Another advantage of Forefront is that fine tuning is much easier. You just click fine tune, pick a JSON file, and choose your model. Forefront is also much cheaper than OpenAI. For example, it only costs 24 cents to fine tune GPTJ.

So I encourage you to check out Forefront and other open source options. I believe they are the future of artificial intelligence.

Forefront AI is a great company that is constantly adding new features. One of the best things about Forefront AI is that it is open source. This means that anyone can access the code and improve it. Another great thing about Forefront AI is that it respects your privacy.

One downside of Forefront AI is that it is slower than some of the other options out there. However, it is still relatively fast, taking only four seconds to process a request.

If you're looking for an open source, privacy-respecting AI company, Forefront AI is a great option.
