The state of the industry is rapidly changing, particularly in the area of GPUs and AI. There are a number of factors influencing the current landscape, from political tensions to advances in technology. Here's a look at some of the key points to keep in mind.

One of the biggest concerns right now is the potential for a disruption to the supply chain of GPUs. This is due to the ongoing tension between the US and China, as well as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. While the Pentagon has said that an invasion is unlikely to happen in the next two years, it's still a possibility that could have a major impact on the availability of GPUs.

In response to the tensions, the US has barred Advanced Tech firms from building China factories for 10 years. This is likely to force China to develop its own AI chip technology, which could lead to them becoming a major competitor in the market. In addition, US officials have ordered Nvidia to halt sales of its top AI chips to China.

Another factor influencing the landscape is the recent switch from proof of work to proof of stake by Ethereum. This change has effectively ended GPU mining for Ethereum, which could lead to a decrease in demand for GPUs. However, it also provides an opportunity for the market to correct itself and for GPUs to be used for their intended purpose, such as gaming.

Bloom, the latest open source model, is roughly equivalent to GPT3. It takes up 768 gigabytes of GPU RAM, which is a lot bigger than any of us can afford right now. However, with ongoing refinement and the availability of more data center-grade GPUs, it may soon be possible to run these models locally.

The state of the industry is rapidly changing and there are a number of factors to keep an eye on. From political tensions to advances in technology, it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.

The question of whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) can create art has been a controversial one. Some believe that AI art is impressive, while others argue that it is unethical. There have been cases of AI art winning awards or being banned by art hosts.

One of the most popular prompts for AI art is to use Greg Rakowski's name. Rakowski is a Polish artist whose work often features nude women. However, the use of his name to generate art has been controversial, as some believe it is unethical.

The Leon 5B data set, which was used to train AI art, may or may not have been ethically built. This is because it crosses international borders, and different countries have different laws regarding data and intellectual property.

Ultimately, the question of whether or not AI can create art is a complex one. There are many factors to consider, including the ethics of using AI to generate art and the legal implications of doing so.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a major disruption in the field of graphic design. With the advent of Photoshop and other software tools, it is now easier than ever for anyone to create professional-looking images. As a result, the need for talent scouts and agents has diminished, as artists can simply post their portfolios online.

This trend is likely to continue, as AI-generated art becomes more sophisticated. Already, there are many examples of AI-created images that are of comparable quality to those created by human designers. In the future, AI will only become more skilled at creating art, to the point where it will eventually surpass human ability.

This poses a serious problem for the millions of people around the world who make their living as graphic artists. With AI able to do their job better and cheaper, many will be out of work. This is just one example of how AI is causing major disruptions across a variety of industries.
