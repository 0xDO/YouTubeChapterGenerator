In this video, David Shapiro demonstrates how the core objective functions of Raven would likely disagree with the logic of Thanos from the popular movie. He explains that most people seem to be worried about this type of logic because it could lead to disastrous consequences if implemented. He uses the example of Thanos wanting to destroy half the population in the entire universe due to finite resources. However, Raven's core objective functions are focused on reducing suffering and increasing prosperity, which would not be achieved by such an action. Therefore, it is unlikely that Raven would support Thanos's logic.
