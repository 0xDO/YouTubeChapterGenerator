Hello everyone,

I wanted to make a quick video to let everyone know that I am taking a break from producing videos about GPT3 and cognitive architectures. The last couple months have been amazing and I went from 150 subscribers to over 500 in just a few weeks. Thank you all for your support!

I am a "burster" personality-wise, which means that I tend to go all-in on projects for a short period of time before moving on to something else. So what you have seen over the last few months is a burst of content from me.

I will be back in two to four months working on other projects. I have six books that I am working on â€“ a trilogy of fiction books and three non-fiction books. I hope that when I come back there will be more advancements in the world of large language models and artificial cognition to talk about.

Thanks again everyone and keep up the good work!
