In this video, I'm going to show you how to use Codex to generate code.

Codex is a tool that can generate code for you, based on natural language descriptions of what you want the code to do.

For example, you can tell Codex to "write a function to get data from Reddit," and it will generate the necessary code for you.

To use Codex, you first need to specify the language you want the code to be written in. In this example, we'll use Python.

Next, you'll need to provide a description of what you want the code to do. In this case, we want it to fetch the top posts from Reddit.

Codex will then generate the code for you. In this case, it wrote a function that fetches the data from Reddit and prints it out.

If you run into any errors, you can use Codex's "edit" feature to automatically fix them.

That's all there is to using Codex! With this tool, you can quickly generate code for any task, without having to write it yourself.

This powershell script will save every prime number from 1 to 1,000 in a csv file.

The script uses a conventional for loop to iterate through each number from 2 to 1,000. For each number, the script checks if it is prime by iterating through every number from 2 to that number and checking if there is a remainder when dividing them. If there is no remainder, the number is not prime and the script breaks. Otherwise, the number is added to a list of prime numbers.

The script then exports the list of prime numbers to a csv file on the desktop.

The script runs quickly and efficiently, and produces a list of all the prime numbers from 1 to 1,000.
