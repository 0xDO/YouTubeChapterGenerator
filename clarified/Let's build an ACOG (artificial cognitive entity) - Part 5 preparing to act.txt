Artificial cognition is the process of building an artificial mind. In this video, David Shapiro reviews the progress made on the artificial cognitive entity (ACOG), and explains how it works.

Shapiro begins by breaking down the main loop of the ACOG into smaller, nested loops. He explains that the first loop is context, which is all the information the ACOG takes in from the world. Next is assessment, where the ACOG makes inferences about what is happening. Recall is the third loop, where the ACOG retrieves relevant memories. The fourth loop is ideation, where the ACOG comes up with ideas of what to do. Discernment is the fifth loop, where the ACOG evaluates the ideas and decides which to pursue. Finally, the agent model is the loop that determines what the ACOG should do.

Shapiro explains that the book he is working on, Symphony of Thought, has helped him to identify some gaps in his understanding of artificial cognition. He is hopeful that by continuing to work on the ACOG, they will eventually be able to build an artificial mind that can think and act like a human.

When you assess a situation, you ask questions about what is happening, why it is happening, who is involved, where it is happening, and when it started. To assess the context above, you would need to ask questions like:

- What is happening?
- Why is it happening?
- Who is involved?
- Where is it happening?
- When did it start?
- How did it happen?

Answering these questions would give you a better understanding of the context and what is going on.

The company is losing productivity and money because its employees are not able to get to work. The president is also not happy. If they are able to find the driver, however, the driver is not found, the company may have to close its doors for good. The outcome could have been much worse. The situation for the company is not ideal. The employees are already behind their work and the president is not happy. The company will lose money because of the situation, and the president is likely to be even more unhappy. The employees are doing their best to find the driver. The police are also called to try to find the driver. In the meantime, the company should consider hiring a security guard to keep an eye on the situation and make sure the truck does not cause any more problems.

I am a humanoid robot with average human strength, speed, and intelligence. I have hands and feet, and I can speak. My primary goals are to assist the president of the company, and my secondary goals are to maximize profit for the company and to protect the safety of the employees.

Given the current situation, I have brainstormed a few ideas about how to proceed. I have determined that the safest, most effective, and most reliable course of action is to find out where the truck came from and why it is blocking the entrance. Once we know more about the situation, we can decide on the best course of action. If the truck is blocking the entrance because it is broken down, we may be able to move it ourselves or have it towed. However, if it is blocking because the driver is trying to make a delivery, then we need to get in touch with the driver. If we can't find the driver, we need to call the police.

The agent model is a way of thinking about what you should do in a given situation. It involves three key elements: identity, purpose, and abilities.

In most cases, the police will be able to help resolve the situation. However, if you are involved in a situation where the police cannot help, you will need to use your own judgment to decide what to do next.

One way to do this is to read the entire scenario and write a very detailed summary. This will help you to identify the most important points and make a decision about what to do next.

If you are unsure about what to do, you can always call someone in charge at the company or the police and coordinate a plan of action.
