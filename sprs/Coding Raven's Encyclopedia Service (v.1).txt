- David Shapiro presents episode on Raven AGI's encyclopedic service.
- Encyclopedic service provides Raven with verified facts.
- Generative models like GPT-3 lack inherent truth discernment.
- Encyclopedic service uses Simple English Wikipedia for manageable size.
- Wikipedia's full size: 18-19 GB compressed, 81 GB uncompressed.
- Simple English Wikipedia: under 1 GB, simpler language, smaller subset.
- Shapiro demonstrates cleaning Wikipedia's markup to plain text.
- JSON format used for cleaned data, categories and links removed.
- Script processes Wikipedia XML, extracts articles, removes unwanted markup.
- SQLite database stores articles; unique IDs prevent duplicates.
- Indexing improves search speeds within the database.
- Script uses regex, HTML to text conversion, and wiki text parser for cleaning.
- Final output: plain text articles, about half the size of original markup.
- Raven's "brain" will be a single database file of Simple English Wikipedia.
- Future improvements may include Apache Solr for enhanced search capabilities.
- GPT-3 will assist Raven in parsing and summarizing documents.
- Encyclopedic service will enhance Raven's problem-solving by providing information.
- Raven aims to have a library of human knowledge internally accessible.
- Code for the project available on GitHub; updates to follow on integration with Raven.
