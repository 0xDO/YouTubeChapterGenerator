David Shapiro discusses Automuse 3, a project involving simulations for testing cognitive architecture and its application to open-ended worlds in video games. He shifts focus from simulations to fiction writing due to audience interest. Writing long-form fiction is challenging, requiring years of cognitive labor. Decomposition breaks down cognitive tasks for large language models, often needing expert intervention. Two primary story-writing methods are pantsing (writing without planning) and plotting (structured writing with outlines). Pantsing involves starting with a premise and expanding, then refining in cycles. Plotting is more structured, leading to coding potential. A novel is a list of scenes refined iteratively. Shapiro starts a new repository, "plotter novel writer," aiming to generate a title, theme, setting, characters, and plot from a random premise. He uses prompt engineering to create a title generator and iteratively develops themes, settings, characters, and plots, acknowledging the need for fine-tuning and creativity. The process involves brainstorming and expanding on each element, with the goal of creating a minimum viable product for a story. Shapiro emphasizes the iterative nature of writing, where initial generic outputs are refined over time. He plans to continue expanding and refining each story element in future work.
