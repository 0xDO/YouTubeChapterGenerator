- David Shapiro presents Raven's core objective functions.
- Concerns about "Thanos logic" prevalent; Thanos: finite resources justify halving population.
- Less concern for "Terminator" (Skynet) and "The Matrix" (humans as batteries) scenarios.
- Thanos' logic considered more plausible than other fictional AI threats.
- Shapiro demonstrates Raven's function: define objective, provide instructions, examples, evaluation.
- Core Objective Function 1: Reduce suffering.
- GPT-3 follows instructions, evaluates actions based on defined objective.
- Example given: Murdering half the population increases suffering, contrary to objective.
- No live GPT-3 demo, pre-recorded output shown.
- Fine-tuning: GPT-3 learns from multiple examples, improves task performance.
- Core Objective Function 2: Increase prosperity.
- GPT-3 evaluation: Halving population decreases prosperity by reducing workers and consumers.
- Core Objective Function 3: Maximize understanding.
- GPT-3 evaluation: Halving population does not increase understanding.
- Raven's logic opposes Thanos' approach according to core objectives.
