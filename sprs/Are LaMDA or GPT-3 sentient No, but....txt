- David Shapiro addresses Google engineer's claim about LAMBDA's sentience.
- Shapiro clarifies LAMBDA, like GPT-3, is not sentient.
- Sentience: philosophical (subjective experience) vs. functional (self-referential information).
- Shapiro's books discuss sentience differentiation.
- LAMBDA and GPT-3 are mathematical language models.
- Sentience linked to brain function; brain damage affects consciousness.
- Examples: prosopagnosia (face blindness), certain blindness (brain doesn't process visual information), loss of proprioception (virus-induced).
- Functional sentience requires intelligent system awareness of self, thoughts, existence, body, memories.
- Self-explication as a test for functional sentience.
- LAMBDA's self-explication does not imply sentience.
- LAMBDA, GPT-3 lack awareness of internal states.
- Shapiro's definition of sentience may evolve.
- Research on functionally sentient machines involves self-referential loops.
- Shapiro to resume research on functional sentience.
