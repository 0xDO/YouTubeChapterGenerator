- David Shapiro creates video content on GPT and ChatGPT.
- Shapiro seeks Patreon support for his educational efforts.
- Patreon benefits: exclusive blog access, Patreon-only videos.
- OpenAI, creator of GPT, shifted from open-source to closed-source and for-profit.
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) predicts text tokens.
- GPT's power lies in its embedded knowledge from extensive training data.
- GPT models vary in size, measured by parameter count.
- Larger GPT models have more parameters, equating to more processing power.
- GPT flavors: vanilla (foundation models) and fine-tuned (e.g., Codex, Instruct, ChatGPT).
- Fine-tuning uses transfer learning, requires fewer data than initial training.
- ChatGPT's flavor developed through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback).
- ChatGPT's memory: rolling window, speculated search or scratch pad, potential knowledge graph.
- ChatGPT's latent space contains vast, embedded knowledge.
- ChatGPT complements human capabilities, offloading cognitive tasks.
- ChatGPT's impact: investment surge, proof of AI readiness, potential for rapid societal change.
- ChatGPT's limitations: operational cost, safety, privacy concerns.
- 2023 seen as the beginning of the singularity or fourth Industrial Revolution.
- Rapid change anticipated due to AI technologies like ChatGPT.
