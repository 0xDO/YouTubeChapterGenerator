- David Shapiro continues work on Auto Muse 3.
- Focus on fine-tuning for scene simulation.
- Aim: create model that advances scenes given initial setup.
- Experimentation with character and event simulations planned.
- Prompt engineering proved frustrating, switching to conventional fine-tuning.
- Synthetic data generation using prompts with location, time, character, and scene details.
- UUIDs used to increase internal entropy and reduce repetition.
- Over 600 different settings to generate scenes.
- OpenAI's price reduction makes synthetic data generation more economical.
- Next steps: generate basic scenes, then prompts to advance plot.
- Fine-tune model to advance plot scene by scene.
- Additional fine-tuning for character POV simulation.
- Character simulation to include stream of consciousness and interiority.
- Character traits important for simulation: backstory, beliefs, preferences, motivations, connections.
- Agent model concept: input, processing, output loop.
- Character simulation feeds into scene simulation, creating a cycle.
- Character traits form the agent model for simulation.
- Simulations can be used for fiction, AGI alignment testing, and understanding human cognition.
- Interaction with the world varies: game world, real world, fictional world.
- Consciousness defined as an agent interacting with an external world.
- Video to be continued in part two with further development on character and scene simulations.
