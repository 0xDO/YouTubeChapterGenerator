- David Shapiro presents a two-video day rarity.
- Post-project completion, Shapiro's mind prompts for the next endeavor.
- Auto Muse revisited, a popular project aimed at writing a novel via fine-tuning.
- Auto Muse's method: interlocking narrative chunks creating a chain of story.
- Fine-tuning led to repetitive content, prompting exploration of cognitive architectures and simulations.
- Simulation service and Nexus critical for artificial general intelligence in a sandboxed world.
- Text-based simulations equated to storytelling, leading to Auto Muse 3's conception.
- Auto Muse 3 demonstrated: summarizes story, sets scenes, dialogues, and events in cycles.
- Repetitiveness acknowledged, adjustments made to reduce it.
- Simulation script detailed: infinite loop, story loading from logs, summarization, scene setting, character actions, and event progression.
- Story elements saved as chronologically sequential logs, mirroring AGI's story structure.
- Character profiles, summaries, and recent events used to generate character actions/dialogue.
- Event generation aimed at advancing the plot with rarity events.
- Iterative process with separation of character, setting, and plot into individual simulations.
- Challenges with scene momentum and event handling noted.
- Compile story script converts logs into prose, with ongoing refinement needed.
- Auto Muse 3's development is iterative, with no promises for continuation.
- Shapiro contemplates the project's future sophistication and direction.
