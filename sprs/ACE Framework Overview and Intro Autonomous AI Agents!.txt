- David Shapiro announces completion of ACE Framework paper.
- ACE Framework: Autonomous Cognitive Entity framework.
- Academic team collaboration; paper submission to arXiv.
- Paper: deep dive into abstract scientific concepts.
- Research: interdisciplinary, extensive citations, LLMs.
- GitHub repository: DaveShapiroAce_Framework, MIT license.
- Framework practicality: reduced jargon, generative AI focus.
- Project overview: updated contribution guidelines, agile team size.
- Demonstrations planned: game using Pygame, desktop assistant.
- Hackability: reference architecture for ACE applications.
- ACE Framework: six layers, abstract to concrete.
- Aspirational layer: morality, ethics, mission.
- Global strategy layer: environmental context, overarching strategy.
- Agent model layer: capabilities, limitations, memories.
- Executive function layer: risks, resources, plans.
- Cognitive control layer: task selection, switching.
- Task prosecution layer: execution of tasks, interaction with world.
- Northbound and southbound buses: communication channels.
- Human-readable communication: transparency, security.
- Aspirational layer: abstract, guides entity behavior.
- Global strategy layer: synthesizes strategy from mission and context.
- Agent model layer: self-awareness, episodic and declarative memory.
- Executive function layer: pre-action consideration of risks and resources.
- Cognitive control layer: mediates task execution based on plans.
- Task prosecution layer: actual task execution, real-world interaction.
- Security considerations: overlays, runtime validation, ensembles, inference inspection.
- Future work: research paper publication, practical demonstrations, framework enhancements.
