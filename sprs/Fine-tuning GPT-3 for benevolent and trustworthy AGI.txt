- David Shapiro discusses fine-tuning GPT-3 for benevolent, trustworthy AGI.
- Core objective functions: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding.
- Heuristic mandates guide AGI learning and decision-making.
- Functions are biomimetic, reflecting fundamental human and life form behaviors.
- Reduce suffering: instinctual response to negative stimuli across life forms.
- Increase prosperity: multifaceted, includes wealth, well-being, happiness.
- Increase understanding: intrinsic learning leads to pro-social behavior, better decisions.
- AGI to use functions as moral center, decision-making guide, avoiding vague mandates.
- Functions integrated into AGI thought, central to operation.
- AGI uses transformers to interpret and adapt to functions.
- Synthetic datasets seed core objective function models.
- AGI records experiences, integrates them into fine-tuning datasets.
- More experiences with functions lead to greater belief, affinity, application.
- AGI's belief in functions based on data provided, pro-social data leads to pro-social values.
- Addressing common questions: functions do not specify for whom to reduce suffering, allow AGI to explore concepts.
- Functions account for individual differences, cultural needs, not limited to humans.
- AGI's understanding of philosophy seen as superhuman due to extensive data training.
- Demonstrates AGI application to real-world situations: relationship issues, climate change anxiety, social isolation.
- AGI provides advice, suggests counseling, therapy, self-help resources.
- AGI's responses based on training data, need for data set refinement acknowledged.
- Future work includes improving training data set, further integration of core objective functions.
