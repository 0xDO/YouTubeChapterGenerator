- Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) are an efficient solution for language model limitations.
- SPRs utilize associative properties of language models, similar to human brains.
- Dave Shap introduced SPRs 7 months ago; details available in his repository.
- SPRs activate latent space in Large Language Models (LLMs) through semantic associations.
- LLMs embed knowledge, abilities, concepts, reasoning, planning, theory of mind.
- Human logic flaws parallel LLMs' imperfect logic; both use associative learning.
- SPRs bypass complex loops in memory GPT for knowledge retrieval.
- Teaching LLMs: initial bulk training, fine-tuning, online learning, in-context learning.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) uses vector databases, knowledge graphs.
- Context window limitations are algorithmic; token count is fixed.
- Latent space is LLMs' superpower, akin to human associative learning.
- SPRs prime LLMs to understand complex, novel ideas outside training data.
- SPRs compress information into token-efficient representations for in-context learning.
- SPRs are stored in metadata and injected at inference, not human-readable data.
- SPRs are rendered as lists of statements, assertions, associations, concepts, analogies, metaphors.
- Example: ACE framework compressed into SPR, then unpacked to full content.
- SPRs allow semantic compression, reconstructing ideas from minimal details.
- SPRs can be nested in metadata, allowing for complex concept representation.
- Dave Shap's system message guides LLMs in using SPRs for advanced NLP, NLU, NLG tasks.
