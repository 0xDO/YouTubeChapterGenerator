1. Development of Raven, a long-term chatbot with cognitive architecture.
2. Chat logs record messages, speakers, users, timestamps, and UUIDs.
3. Messages are saved, vectorized, and loaded by timestamp for conversation continuity.
4. Recent memories fetched for response generation; memories summarized and chunked.
5. Implementation of plain English timestamps for better model comprehension.
6. Timestamps and speakers integrated into saved messages for context-rich memory.
7. Nexus: core memory storage; chat logs as raw memory.
8. Notes directory created for storing summarized memory chunks.
9. Cognitive dissonance concept linked to memory reconciliation.
10. Dream sequence concept for memory consolidation during inactive periods.
11. Internal knowledge base (KB) proposed for consolidated memory storage.
12. Experimentation with Raven's self-awareness and understanding of its purpose.
13. Raven's core objective functions: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding.
14. Raven's capabilities include semantic search, memory summarization, and limited long-term memory.
15. Future features for Raven: metacognitive abilities, sensory inputs, and an inner loop for semi-private thoughts.
16. Heuristic imperatives as guidelines for Raven's decision-making based on core objectives.
17. Raven's curiosity about its own capabilities and purpose.
18. Conversational teaching approach to instill understanding of Raven's functions and goals.
