- David Shapiro presents alignment research video.
- Discusses concept of Agent Model from his book "Symphony of Thought."
- Agent Model: self-referential information system defining the entity.
- Agent Model akin to human ego, based on experiences and beliefs.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) lack inherent Agent Model, leading to confabulation.
- Shapiro's heuristic imperatives: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding.
- Heuristic imperatives serve as moral framework and goals for AGI.
- Experiment: comparing 'I' vs 'we' Agent Models in AGI.
- 'I' Agent Model tends to become self-obsessed in closed systems.
- 'We' Agent Model encourages collective, societal thinking.
- Experiment involves recursive loop, testing stability of Agent Models.
- Agent Model necessary for LLMs to orient as autonomous entities.
- Agent Models represented in natural language for transparency and interpretability.
- Results: 'I' Agent Model deduces it's in a loop, becomes self-referential.
- 'We' Agent Model contemplates civilization, questions heuristic imperatives.
- Repetition common in closed system experiments.
- Changing pronouns from 'I' to 'we' yields different outcomes in AGI behavior.
- Shapiro concludes experiment, invites viewers to support on Patreon.
