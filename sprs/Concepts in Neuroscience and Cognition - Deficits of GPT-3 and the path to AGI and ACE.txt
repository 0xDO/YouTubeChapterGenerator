- David Shapiro records a midnight video discussing cognitive concepts.
- Shapiro experiences problem-solving insomnia, prompting late-night work.
- He explores working memory, task sets, and cognitive control in relation to GPT-3.
- Working memory: temporary information storage and manipulation system, limited capacity, crucial for cognitive tasks.
- Phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad are subsystems of working memory.
- GPT-3 lacks working memory, relies on recall or embedding.
- Task set: collection of tasks for achieving a goal, size affects difficulty.
- Cognitive control: regulation of thoughts, emotions, behaviors for goals, mediated by prefrontal cortex.
- Shapiro proposes core objective functions for AGI: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding.
- Default mode network (DMN): brain regions active during rest, involved in self-referential thought.
- Recall: retrieving information from memory, essential for learning and planning.
- Intuition: pattern recognition for quick decisions, based on limited information.
- Heuristics: mental shortcuts for decision-making, can lead to good or bad outcomes.
- GPT-3's impulsiveness requires external systems for cognitive control.
- AGI may require multimodal models and dedicated systems for different cognitive tasks.
- Shapiro concludes with a summary of the discussed concepts and their relevance to AGI research.
