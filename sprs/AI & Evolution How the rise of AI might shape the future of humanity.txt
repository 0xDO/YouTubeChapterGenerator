- Natural selection, sexual selection, gene flow, genetic drift, and mutation are evolutionary mechanisms.
- Food, environmental change, predation, disease, and competition are evolutionary pressures.
- Humans are toolmakers, impacting evolution through technology.
- Tools and fire expanded dietary options and social structures.
- Industrial Revolution and mechanization further influenced human evolution.
- Gene flow increased with global transit, affecting human genetic diversity.
- AI technologies like CRISPR and AlphaFold could directly impact evolution.
- AI's role in education, intelligence, and potential to make humans smarter or dumber is discussed.
- Post-scarcity economics could change human relationships and evolutionary trajectory.
- AI in dating could affect mate selection, a primary driver of evolution.
- Ethics and ramifications of AI influencing evolution are considered.
- Evolutionary pressures, tool use, mechanization, AI technologies, education, post-scarcity, and AI in dating are key topics.
- Shapiro concludes with the potential impacts of AI on human evolution.
