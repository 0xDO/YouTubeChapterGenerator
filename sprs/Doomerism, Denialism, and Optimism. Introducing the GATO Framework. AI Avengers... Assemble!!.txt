David Shapiro discusses doomerism, denialism, optimism, and a comprehensive framework for AI growth.

- Exponential growth in AI, not linear.
- Parameter counts in neural networks growing exponentially.
- Doomerism: belief in inevitable decline, collapse, or dystopian outcome.
- Denialism: dismissal of AGI and hard takeoff as distant or impossible.
- Optimism: belief in solvable problems and positive outcomes.
- Thought leaders often embody these perspectives.
- Sympathy for doomers: recognition of existential risks and need for safeguards.
- Flaws in doomerism: overemphasis on worst-case scenarios, dogmatism, discouragement of innovation.
- Sympathy for denialists: skepticism based on past overpromises, emphasis on current AI limitations.
- Flaws in denialism: underestimation of risks, lack of urgency, ignorance of exponential growth and saltatory leaps.
- Social impacts: polarization, nihilism, fatalism, complacency, inaction.
- Overton window: range of acceptable discourse too narrow.
- Lack of coherent global strategy for AI.
- GATO framework: Global Alignment Taxonomy Omnibus, a multi-layered approach to AI alignment.
- Seven layers of GATO: model alignment, autonomous systems, decentralized networks, corporate adoption, national regulations, international treaties, global consensus.
- Open source data sets and reference architectures for aligned AI.
- Encouraging aligned AI adoption in corporations, nations, and international cooperation.
- Global consensus on AI alignment through education, media engagement, industry partnerships, policy advocacy.
- Avengers analogy: collective effort to avert or undo disaster.
- Call to action for participation and support in AI alignment efforts.
