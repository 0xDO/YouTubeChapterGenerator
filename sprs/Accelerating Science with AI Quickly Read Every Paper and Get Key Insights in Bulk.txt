David Shapiro discusses research paper overload and automation solutions.

- Research papers proliferate rapidly; staying current is challenging.
- Automation engineer background; preference for creating tools over manual tasks.
- Automated a three petabyte environment to avoid manual management.
- Objective: digest and operationalize research paper consumption.
- Automation can assist scientists in high-velocity fields like AI and quantum computing.
- Shapiro demonstrates an automated system for summarizing research papers.
- System inputs paper text, outputs condensed summaries via prompted questions.
- Summaries simplify language, compress content, and provide clear explanations.
- System can generate analogies and metaphors for broader audience comprehension.
- Shapiro plans to enhance the system to process batches of papers from a folder.
- Encounters issues with outdated code libraries, highlighting the need for continual learning in AI.
- Fixes code issues, demonstrating the practical application of continual learning.
- Final output is an HTML document with headers and Q&A sections for each paper.
- Tool is shared under the MIT license to aid in accelerating scientific progress.
