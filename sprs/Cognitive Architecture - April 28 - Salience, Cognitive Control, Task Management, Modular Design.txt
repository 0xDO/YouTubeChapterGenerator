- Introduction to Heroistic Imperatives Discord research group.
- Group focuses on building cognitive architecture.
- Database, member of cognitive AI Channel, known for debates.
- Ansel, computer science engineer, fascinated by cognitive architecture.
- Database's recent engagement with cognitive architecture due to Auto GPT.
- Ansel's background in C# and recent Python experience.
- Challenges: finding a host for language model with working API.
- Solution: Uba Booga API for hosting multiple language models.
- Switch to OpenAI for rapid development and resource saving.
- Development of Salience Module, a Python script for cognitive loops.
- Salience Loop: initializes agents, processes task list, allows manual or auto mode.
- Logic Loop: designed for quick agent and logic loop creation.
- Salience Agent: sorts and filters task list, passes tasks to Job Agent.
- Job Agent: summarizes related results, executes tasks, handles frustration.
- Analyst Agent: evaluates task completion, provides feedback.
- System designed for easy modification and extensibility.
- Use of JSON files for prompt configuration.
- Main loop and agents designed for simplicity and modularity.
- Project open for collaboration, seeking contributors for new agents and features.
- Project licensed under GNU General Public License.
- Future goals: win hackathon, expand functionality, empower users to build AI systems.
- Project aims to be an engine for heuristic imperatives and other AI initiatives.
- Desire for project to be used broadly and to empower non-programmers.
- Project's semi-autonomous capabilities and potential for full autonomy discussed.
- Collaboration through GitHub and cognitive AI Discord.
- Project's significance in the evolving field of cognitive architecture highlighted.
