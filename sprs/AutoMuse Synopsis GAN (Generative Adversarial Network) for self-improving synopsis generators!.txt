- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating story synopses.
- Synopses serve as story seeds, premises for fiction generation.
- Removing names from synopses to create "garbage" or low-quality examples.
- Adjusting generative models to avoid generic outputs.
- Synopsis quality grading system from 1 (garbage) to 5 (solid).
- Separation of variable selection and synopsis generation in code.
- Infinite loop for generating and grading synopses until a grade 5 is achieved.
- High temperature setting for fiction generation to increase variation.
- Discriminator improves by setting criteria for a good synopsis.
- Three pillars of a story: setting, plot, character.
- Setting must include location, time period, and cultural context.
- Characters must be named and have arcs.
- Plot requires clear beginning, middle, end, and narrative progression.
- Fine-tuning models to generate synopses based on input formats.
- Input formats: list of appeal terms, reference interviews, stream of consciousness, list of comp titles.
- Fine-tuned model generates synopses with themes and moral truths.
- Open problem: generating names for characters and places.
- Integration of Whisper for speech-to-text in GPT-3.
