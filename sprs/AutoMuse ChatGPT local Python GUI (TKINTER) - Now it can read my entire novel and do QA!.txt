- David Shapiro presents a video update.
- Demonstrates a primitive graphical user interface (GUI).
- Discusses issues with ChatGPT: network errors, lost history.
- Learning ChatGPT API, access to GPT-4 (not 32,000 tokens).
- Seeks access to 32,000 token model for novel-writing.
- Repo named "chat chapter summarizer gpt4" provides developmental feedback, pros feedback, and chat capability.
- Utilizes 8,000 token window to summarize chapters.
- Scratch Pad feature for chapter summaries.
- Documentation for Auto Muse instance.
- Permanent record of chat logs maintained locally, excluded from git.
- GUI developed with Python, color-coded, uses threading.
- System message prompt for writing assistance, references professional writing concepts.
