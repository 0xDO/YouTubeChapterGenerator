good morning everybody as information continues to develop about the chaos happening over at open aai we're starting to get a clearer picture of what happened now at first it was made to appear that ilas ssav was the ring leader behind Sam alman's ouster and certainly that appeared to be plausible because of uh some of the tensions and disagreements between um Ila's approach to AI safety and alignment and Sam alman's approach to safety and alignment and one of the things that we were all speculating about is maybe they either achieved AGI or they were approaching uh AGI and that this is what caused tensions to blow up now it seems like the answer was much simpler than that it seems like one of the board members Adam D'Angelo had a conflict of interest where the sudden release of gpts by uh by open Ai and Sam Alman completely invalidated his other uh project um his PO project and so it seems like the way that you could read this now is that a board member accused Sam Alman of of quote not being candid by not letting the board know that this product launch was coming and that uh he basically said well let me just sabotage open AI um in order to try and preserve my own other interests so in this case the one not being fully candid You could argue would have been Adam D'Angelo in this case because if he had if he had a financial conflict of interest that prevented him from being a responsible member of the board um that is actually uh pretty significant now you could also argue that Sam Alman as CEO had a duty to the board to be fully transparent about all product launches uh who knows there is some speculation that part of the reason that the board has not been forthcoming is because they're lawyer lawyering up which um I'd be I'd look forward to hearing a legally Eagle breakdown of uh of this whole thing who is responsible for whom I've also got some U some really high-powered corporate attorney friends that I'll probably be asking about this um so it seems like whatever the Fallout is whatever Sam Alman ultimately agrees to there could be a long legal battle over this uh now again that is pure speculation on my part um in order for there to be a legal battle people would need to lawyer up and sue people um but given how much money is at stake the fact that open aai had an $86 billion valuation usually when there's that much money on the line people become more litigious um so I would be very wary about that uh now with that being said looking at the grander game of chess open AI has backing from Microsoft and Microsoft has repeatedly and unequivocally said We Stand by our partnership with open AI so let's make sure that we understand why they're doing that so Microsoft's reputation is on the line as soon as Sam mman was fired Microsoft's uh stock price dropped by a full 2% um so billions of dollars worth of valuation was wiped off of Microsoft because of this board move so I wouldn't be surprised if if uh Microsoft is also a plaintiff against Adam D'Angelo if it comes to that um again I am not a lawyer I'm not involved this is pure speculation on my part so do not take this as legal advice do not take this as Financial or investing advice I am just giving you my personal evaluation and interpretation um as the facts evolve now of course when it first happened I was like maybe it's Sam alman's fault and then I said maybe it's Ilia s's fault so I have been wrong repeatedly so I just want to own up to that fact that um as as information develops um I am updating my opinions beliefs and perspectives as should you because again we we do not have the complete picture and as I have said previously we might never have the complete picture this is how it appears right now but understanding that Microsoft has a huge interest not just a financial interest they have a they have a PR interest they have a reputational interest in stability at open AI this uh underscores the question should you as an Enterprise or as a corporation or as a startup continue using open AI I have seen lots of people saying that they're cancelling their chat GPT Plus Membership that they um I've also seen a whole raft of Articles and other conversations happening on LinkedIn and Reddit saying this is the final nail in the coffin we are making sure that we're moving away from open AI Services we're going to be using a different set of apis because we no longer trust that open AI is going to be respons you know there's there's the court of public opinion and then there's also the court of business opinion what whatever else happens whatever you know whether or not Sam Alman comes out looking like a good guy an innocent victim whether or not ilas suts comes out looking like um a you know a highly principled person who is just bewildered by greedy humans because having talked to some of my friends uh Silicon Valley insiders the perception now is that Ilia SG has been a mission first guy uh the whole time although I've seen accusations flying that he never cared about Humanity which is a really absurd assertion especially when you look at his recent Ted Talk um so one thing that I was warned is that some people are very deliberately spreading misinformation uh about this um I'm not going to name names because I don't have any evidence but make sure that you evaluate the sense of things because if someone says ilas s never cared about humanity and he was only in it for the money that does not reconcile with literally everything else he has ever said and people are saying that as if it is a true fact and as if people have believed it all along so I think that that is I think that is uh propaganda I'm not sure who's promulgating it but it is out there uh likewise I'm I'm sure that there's going to be some PR and some spin against Sam and Adam and everyone else you know take everything that you see with a grain of salt um with with respect to this now all that being said none of this is good for business um and putting myself in the shoes of of an IT infrastructure engineer uh back in the day if say for instance I was working at an Enterprise Corporation and we had been building products with the open AI API I would be a little bit nervous and the reason is because well if 93% of open AI staff resigns because we don't know what's happening it looks like the the power struggle is ongoing um then it's entirely possible that the open aai API goes offline for un undetermined lengths of time um now with that being said Microsoft has probably had some back Channel conversations saying you have a duty to your clients to our clients keep your services running while the rest of this like show is going on make sure that you provide quality of service and that the API stays online because that is your cash cow if that goes offline and you start losing you know more clients Enterprise clients you will never recover from that so I have also predicted that this is the death Nell for open AI which that was based on the assumption that that uh many of the open AI staff were going to leave and get scattered to the Four Winds it seems like the open AI staff is actually very highly committed to the mission I've seen people read it different ways where because open AI the staff wanted to follow Sam Alman but it also looked like they wanted to follow Ilia and they wanted to follow Ilia and Sam and Greg and the it seems like the Lynch pin here the one that the really the only toxic element as I'm reading it right now is atom so if this is if this is the thorn in the side that is that is destabilizing the entire organization the entire structure then okay like let's let's talk about that now with all that being said this does illustrate that there was a structural problem and that human institutions are the fragility here and so what I mean by that is humans are always the weakest link this is kind of a tongue-and-cheek joke that we have in the tech industry uh we have a whole bunch of of of terms for it there's pebcak which means problem exists between keyboard and chair there's um id10t error which if you it looks you know it looks like idiot if you spell it out there's a layer eight issues so layer eight refers to the OSI model where layer seven is the application and layer eight is the user so this is unequivocally a human error and this has grievously drastically harmed the reputation of all people involved I know some people have gotten mad at me for saying oh well you blame Sam Alman for running a coup and you blame you know Ilia s for running a coup I don't know who's running the coup but I trust all of them less because of how they've conducted themselves uh and you know as as has been stated by other people there was very poor messaging around the whole thing the the reason that you have a board of advisers is to have stop Gap measures to have things slow down to in in order to be uh more deliberative and more stable and so the fact that the board was unable to do this and Sam Alman was a member of the board as well as ilas utk as well as Greg Brockman that mean that to me tells me that the correct people were not on the board and that the people on the board do not have the uh correct skills whether it's communication skills political skills business skills or whatever because if one toxic element was able to throw a wrench this big in the gears to create this much chaos then it's like okay either he was a really good political operator and had a silver tongue and completely manipulated everyone else or the structure of the board was wrong like the bylaws were were were completely wrong or maybe he wasn't acting alone maybe Ilia was on board with it and then uh once once everything played out he regretted his choice like maybe he sincerely Reg RIT his choices we don't know cu the board has still been mum and again uh I suspect there's very good reasons for that there are lawyers have probably said do not say a single thing publicly um because anything that you can that you say publicly can and will be used against you when this goes to court and it or it goes to mediation um but again this to me is like I don't know it just it like there's something structurally and fundamentally wrong here with the board structure with the people uh participating in the board because again if it was just one they could have overruled him so what happened here what went wrong something something drastic went sideways here so you know is Sam still committed to the mission I think so I don't really agree with his approach to alignment I don't agree with his approach to business I understand it uh likewise uh I do believe that Ilia is committed to the mission I I don't agree with his approach to alignment either um but they know things that I don't uh does that make them bad guys I don't think so um but does that mean that they are equipped to to be the Shepherds of AGI no this proves conclusively that they should not be the only ones in the room uh steering the ship so I still think that it would be better if if open AI were drastically changed um new board um I really hope that Microsoft gets a seat on the board and that the bylaws are changed um if open AI sticks around but again there have been repeated offers from others like um there was what's his name benof trying to like just poach talent in public which is like that's kind of a dick move um so that made me lose a lot of any respect that I had for Ben off um so I was just like no you don't you don't you don't make you don't say oh like chaos is a ladder and I'm going to very publicly like signal um and try and and very clearly make a mercenary move to take advantage of this situation that's very low brow uh so long story short I would be very tepid there's a lot of trepidation in terms of the future of open AI right now because it keeps going back and forth now understanding that maybe Adam D'Angelo had ulterior motives maybe that there was there was some misinformation going on or some some manipulation going on because one of the things of people that that are close to uh close to Ilia the way that they characterize him is that he is like first and foremost like a scientist and so in a book that I read called survival of the Savvy there is there's what's called power of ideas people and there's power of of people people and so what I mean by that is that a power of ideas person thinks that the Merit of the ideas and the mission is external to their ego or external to the decisions but then power of people or power of position people think oh no it's the person is what matters and so I recognize in Ilia a lot of my own traits because I used to believe that like the mission comes first the principles come first the Merit of the ideas comes first not the people which would explain why Ilia could have made such a drastic miscalculation and would have been confused like maybe he had no idea that Adam had ulterior motives or maybe he would have been bewildered by the idea that someone would put their personal interest before such a Grand Mission um I don't know if that's true but having listened to uh ilas Ted Talk I think it's entirely plausible that that's how il's brain works that he's just like what are you guys doing like what it's like that Meme like do you really think someone would do that like join a board of directors and then lie right I I I I could believe that he was honestly confused or bewildered by this Behavior because like he is he is very much like kind of a a dreamer a thinker um rather than oriented towards people and I definitely recommend anyone um in in the business world to read the book survival of the sa Savvy um I'm not that's not a paid advertisement it's just it's a very helpful book to understand um high-powered corporate politics you know okay so I I've I've talked around the issue and I haven't made made a decision but if a client came to me right now and said Dave what should we do and I would say well one don't make any drastic decisions because it is entirely possible that this will all blow over because like I said Microsoft has a vested interest in ensuring that open AI returns to some level of stability because again chaos is bad for business rule rules of acquisition chaos is bad for business unless of course your business is selling chaos um but in this case Microsoft and open AI chaos is not good for their business neither of them wants the chaos to continue um now with that being said it's entirely possible that like it goes belly up so I would say I would recommend to a client if you can switch over to Azure because Azure has all of the same um or most of the same things I've had uh friends and clients tell me oh yeah I switched to azzure and I got access to the models faster and they perform better I don't know if that's true but that's what I'm hearing on the Grapevine um and you know Microsoft Azure is a much more mature platform it's got a lot more options yes it's going to be a pain to to convert this is part of the problem though and this is why I say like this could represent the death Nowell for open AI because a lot of other companies are going to be making this decision they're going to be making this calculus say okay well open AI is now an uncertain quantity an unknown quantity it's too experimental it's too um it's too chaotic it's too volatile so let me move over to to Microsoft Azure which is good for Microsoft right I can imagine all of the Microsoft uh sales agents and sales engineers and Microsoft to account executive saying yeah we'll help you we'll help you move over to Azure and they're like you know they'll say like well we don't have any skin in the game but like it's a business decision right it's good for Microsoft if more clients move over to Azure so I would I would advise a client I would say you know don't make don't make any drastic decisions but maybe maybe this is a sign that it it is time to to move over to a more mature uh set of apis because again we're already seeing language models being commoditized and so what I mean by that is you know for the longest time gpt3 was the new shiny and it was the only thing that was capable of it and yes gp4 is presently one of the most capable models but it's not going to be the only one and and Microsoft already has gp4 um and you know as Microsoft becomes more mature as meta and other competitors release theirs Gemini coming down the pipeline llama 3 is coming down the pipeline so like you know we're going from Blue Ocean to Red ocean and this infighting at open AI uh regardless of the of the science and the technology is a is a major setback from a business perspective um and and as I have said before Sam Alman is a was a scrappy startup CEO he's not an Enterprise grade CEO has no one has gainsay when me when I said that like I pointed out like he's good at the the scrappy startup stuff and he's obviously very close with SAA so he's got some good mentoring I have no doubt that he's got a lot of great mentors to help him learn but you don't necessarily want someone who's learning on the job to be uh like someone that you depend on like this Sam alman's a sharp guy I have no doubt that he will learn um but again the the fact that this was allowed to happen in the first place means that something was was very wrong the fact that Ilia also like signed the letter like demanding the resignation of the board is really interesting and I think I think that he has come around and realized just as we all have that maybe maybe there was there was a toxic element but this also underscores um a principle that I have come to learn in any group is that one toxic uh group member can disrupt the entire thing which is why like I have no bones about like asking someone to leave a group I've done it I've done it several times at this point because in in a group where you should have trust where you should have mutual communication where you should have everyone on the same page if you if you if that is a requirement ment for the group to be functional but you have someone who is either um lying uh either intentionally or or unconsciously lying because that maybe they're holding back it throws the whole group into chaos so what I will say is that like it would be difficult to to lay the blame at at any one person's feet because again I've lived through this personally several times where one toxic person one disordered individual can can upset the the entire apple cart um but that also scores the fragility of human organizations which again is like you know maybe open AI shouldn't be the the technology leader here um maybe it does need to be a broader conversation maybe it does need to be um more uh maybe there needs to be more checks and balances and what I mean by that is multiple organizations so I I talked about this in a video yesterday where having all the talent of from open a scattered to the Four Winds would be a good thing because then you have checks and balances between Microsoft and Google Google and meta and apple and everyone else some of them would go to the government some of them would go to Mozilla oh and by the way uh Mozilla released a very a public statement that I absolutely agree with actually let me bring it up and just show it to you okay so um just a few days ago just a a little bit well I guess almost a month ago um but you know a couple weeks before all this blew up Mozilla said this joint statement on AI safety and openness um and They Came Out Swinging real hard against closed Source things like uh let me see where it was um uh let's see openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities AI models can be abused with malicious actors and deployed by elqui developers however we have seen time and again that the same holds true for proprietary Technologies and increasing Public Access and scrutiny makes technology safer not more dangerous the idea that tight and proprietary control of foundational AI models is the only path to protecting us from society scale harm is naive at best and dangerous at worse so I am 100% behind this this statement by Mozilla AI Safety Research um and so this is this is where like I fundamentally disagree with Sam and Ilia and I'm glad that I'm not the only organization saying this but this is this underscores my point that um one a single organization should not be responsible for this certainly not a single organization as unstable as as open AI uh now uh will some people you know say oh well Dave you're just advocating for other organizations to be more powerful it's like you know what that's the way the world works and yes it could be better it could be worse but I'm also kind of tired of people saying oh my God Microsoft is evil no like that's not a mature opinion uh Bill Gates is not abjectly evil he is not Satan incarnate please stop saying that it is a waste of time um he is a complex human just like everyone else so you know like let's let's be a little bit more mature about this uh when we when we talk going forward so that's that's kind of the long story short or long story long really uh let me know what you think thanks for watching cheers
