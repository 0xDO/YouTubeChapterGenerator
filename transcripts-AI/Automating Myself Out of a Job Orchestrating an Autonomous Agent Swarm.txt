I am trying to automate myself out of a job so back in my days as an IT infrastructure automation engineer one of the key uh lessons that I thought was uh if I automate myself out of a job that means that one I'm a good automator but two it also means that I just have less work to do and I can save my time for doing other stuff so one of the one of the key secrets to automation is you save yourself 5 10 20 minutes every day uh and then it adds up to 1 2 3 4 hours every day until eventually you have automated so many things that you are getting literally hundreds if not thousands of hours worth of work done every single day and every single week which means that you can either kick up your heels and just stick around on the internet while while you're at work or you can automate even more stuff and learn and that's basically what I did and that's how I got to where I'm at so I uh got access to open ai's new gpts feature and of course the first thing thing that I did was build something that people have been asking for for literally like years now is a virtual David chapiro to talk to so Link in the description it is out there you can go use it it will I will work on improving it over time but right now it is equipped with all of my transcripts so you can uh you can ask it all kinds of questions so in this case uh you know I said what are the requirements to achieve AGI and it says a temporal window and axima Alignment uh nashy equilibrium framework and Consciousness and learning abilities again it's not perfect I need to figure out how to format all the data underneath but like you can tell that it's clearly picking up on some of the things that I have talked about so that's what I where I wanted to open the video uh I'll do a real quick plug for my patreon um so I'm starting to do monthly Master Class sessions for the premium tier patreon subscribers so this is going to be uh a monthly kind of webinar session um up to 100 people it's going to be recorded so even if you if even if you miss uh miss it if you're on the premium tier you'll get to see the recording uh but yeah so uh we're going to talk about uh the state of the AI industry I'll give you kind of a brief update from my perspective what I'm seeing the trends the Technologies the techniques that sort of thing then uh the second part of the master class session will be a lesson in systems thinking from my upcoming book and then third finally um we'll do a Mastery teaching session which is more or less a Q&A format but it's a it's a Mastery dialogue uh session to kind of talk about everything that we've covered and that is uh the first one is today at 10: a.m. us Eastern so if you're seeing this you might have already missed the window but go ahead and sign up uh I will be raising the price of my premium patreon tier uh in early 2024 um as the value of this content goes up so with all that being said let's move on over to the open aai Agent swarm So speaking of automating myself out of a job uh this is really exploding we have had so much engagement um and so what I wanted to do was uh basically conduct this and so what I wanted to do was basically conduct this like uh kind of a scrum where I just kind of show everyone all the discussions that have been happening and tell you kind of what the next steps are so uh right at the very top um we have a couple folks jumping in and we're we're experimenting with what are the the function s the tools that you need to to create another agent and so what I did was I went and tried to create uh create an agent over here with the agents um I called it hephestus Hammer of the the hos project and it didn't it didn't work really well I really I really barfed it like cuz I asked like what is the per the purpose of the Supreme oversight board so let's see if it works cuz it often doesn't but anyways my idea right now is because it's so easy to to build these gpts maybe these gpts at the front end should be the way that we orchestrate the rest of the the autonomous swarm and so while this is running I wanted to differentiate because when I say autonomous some people say like what do you mean and some I I I've seen a few comments I've had a few people reach out on LinkedIn they say oh well this is a fully autonomous framework and it's like if it weights for a human instructions it is not autonomous that is orchestration orchestration is where a human pushes button and then a rubbe Goldberg machine comes to life and it goes and does the human's bidding and then once it's done it stops the purpose of an autonomous swarm is that you set up the initial configuration with a mission with Mission parameters or or higher order goals and the Swarm keeps going indefinitely um and it doesn't it it it might need some help or feedback at some points but it is designed to not need human feedback um so in this case the the hephestus hammer uh say said the Supreme oversight board within the the hierarchical autonomous agents SW okay so in this case it worked like I said we're still figuring this out so establishing and upholding ethical standards high level decision-making ultimate authority of checks and balances guiding and Searing the house okay cool so you are there I'll have a link to this one as well but again be warned this is still in beta we're still figuring this out and we're fudging through but we you have an agent called hesus Hammer that can help teach you about the the hos framework and I also gave it the the the documentation so hypothetically it can help you do the coding um okay so that's pretty cool and let's uh oops let's come back to where did it go okay so then one of the other problems that we're discussing about is how do you organize all this and so as I mentioned uh a bunch of people have really jumped in and it's been super helpful and so here's here's someone actually threw together a great diagram as to how this works so in this case the the Saab the Supreme oversight board will be populated with a bunch of archetypes or personas or whatever they are the they're going to debate about what to do how when and why but again they're given the overarching mission and the context of what the Swarm is supposed to do in this case they chose Captain Kirk King Solomon and Socrates now that would be an interesting conversation um and so the Saab is they create the executive board and then the executive board um focuses on all the other actual tasks so one thing that I did want to point out is that there have been like I'm really glad that uh a bunch of people have jumped in um and I've had to I've had to to to steer the ship pretty hard because uh despite despite the enthusiasm uh some people just didn't quite get it and they wanted to change the scope of the project they're like let's do local agents we're not doing local agents right now because that's going to take way too long and it is time to move fast and Break Stuff also someone tried to like add the idea of like let's do a dow a decentralized autonomous organization again that's a bottom up management this is a top- down management so uh just wanted to say like this design is on purpose um and and that is because in order to orchestrate a swarm you need to have top- down command and control whereas you don't want the the agents at the very bottom to all be voting one that's a waste of tokens and two Dows are good for organizing social movements where where like equality for all is critical this is not about equality this is about getting stuff done as efficiently as possible so the hos framework is a top down command and control structure so I really appreciate people doing this um but yeah this is a perfect diagram so tier zero is the Supreme oversight board tier one is the executive board tier two and all the all the child agents below that so basically each agent is able to create worker agents um as needed in order to delegate out now we'll probably have some some general rules where it's like okay once you get to tier five you're basically EXP Ed to be a worker and like do something so one idea that I had was that in or instead of having one agent keeping track of multiple tasks you have one task per agent and so that might mean you know you might spin up an agent with the sole purpose of like write this function or or fix this bug or send an email to you know Mark Zuckerberg or whatever right like so one task for one agent probably at tier four or five this is where I'm thinking we're going it's obviously not set in stone so thanks for jumping in and contributing that um I think that was it for this thread yes so okay and it looks like someone has jumped in and created a tool Creator and Tool user demo so I'll show you this this conversation so complete the working implementation of automated tool and assistant Builder so this is great I'll I'll add a comment like I'll check this out uh recording now um submit a PR please once it's done so yep uh let's see moving right along use AI coder like a sweep so this was a this was a great idea that that uh uh Alexander inking um came up with which so basically this was like a meta process for probably instantiating swarms or evolving swarms over time uh which I really appreciate that idea uh we're probably not going to focus on this just yet but basically one swarm is going to have like one overarching Mission um but the Swarm you might need to deprovision the entire swarm and then start over and so then it's like what if you treat um all of the different components of the Swarm like a genetic algorithm so that that way you can just say like here's a bunch of variables so then when you go to instantiate a swarm you can measure like how well the Swarm did and then tweak those variables later so I really appreciate that idea and here was another idea this one is a little bit complicated um but it is a really good workflow of the the actual formal Logic the workflow of how things uh work um we're still we're still workshopping uh exactly how the agent are going to communicate so uh member of the ace framework and a few other people have some ideas about how that will work uh but yeah so there we go we have someone who created another uh GPT with a chat interface so let's see explain agent swarms this is good but yeah so um now that you're kind of a little bit more familiar with where we're at today I do want to invite people to submit more um issues and pull requests and I'll show you exactly what I what I want and what I mean in just a moment there we go cool so this this agent swarm um GPT seems to be working okay so I have two issues out here so this is where we're getting into like uh let's let's have the rubber meet the road so one idea that I had was I I would like if someone would create a Discord version um and so where where you could put that in the in the repo is just do like another folder like you know Discord connector or Discord version just to get the ball rolling that might be too complicated um at at first um because we've also been talking about like how do we get agents to talk directly to each other and that sort of thing and the other Bounty that I have out here is take a stab at building a toolmaker agent so uh a few people have already done that so let's uh as a community let's look at some of the proposals that we have there's a few out there um and um I'll I'll actually create some better organization in the discussion so by the time you see it I'll have a few better few better things here and I'm also going to create another issue um that is about doing some of the the instantiation via the gpts uh rather than just the API so basically I want the GPT to be able to use the API in order to to uh orchestrate all this stuff uh I hope that makes sense but yeah so thanks for watching um yeah this is really exciting and I think I'm finally getting the hang of how do you organize and orchestrate open source development um but yeah so what I'm going to do right after this and by the time you see this video is I'm going to organize the discussions a little bit better and organize the issues a little bit better and yes once once we have the uh a look just a little bit more I'd like to see some more poll requests either today or this weekend or next week um so that we can get some of these demos up and running and I think that as fast as you guys are moving we've got the agent Builder we've got the toolmaker now we just need to integrate it and then the last thing is figuring out communication Cu uh folks definitely see and understand the the hierarchy so thanks for watching like subscribe etc etc hop on over on patreon hop on over on Discord uh connect with me on LinkedIn also I've got a free substack all the links are in the description um but yeah thanks for thanks for coming along for the ride this is super exciting and um yeah I'm just super jazzed we're we're getting some we're getting some real work done have a good one everybody
