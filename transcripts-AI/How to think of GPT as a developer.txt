hello good morning um so today's video is a little bit different format um but I felt like this was really important because I have gotten this question or various permutations of this question uh at least half a dozen times in the last week and so that tells me that there's something going on out there in The Ether out there in the world and it's really resonating so I wanted to just give kind of a fireside chat today um and my audience today is developers so obviously uh I'm a former it infrastructure engineer I did Cloud virtualization and automation I've pivoted to YouTube and Ai and uh many of you in the audience I think what probably 40 to 60% are in some kind of tech space and the question that I get is should I stay with computer science or how do I Safeguard myself in the age of AI usually there there's a few different variations of this question but I get this question quite a bit and so one of the things that I tell people is I started with Pascal and C um you might not know that because the code that I write is not particularly good as I've mentioned I'm not I was never a professional developer I was more into Automation and stuff but having started with the basics with very old languages like Pascal and C that serves a tremendous uh like underpinning kind of you know foundational framework for understanding raw Computer Logic so if you're in computer science and you know the basics like that will help you even in the age of generative AI probably especially in the age of generative AI um like one of one of my personal biggest weaknesses is math um it turns out I was I was really good at math but I hated it because of the way that it was taught here in America anyways so the point there the first point is that yes investing in the underpinning skills from from me from my perspective my personal opinion is that yes it is absolutely worth it um even when as generative AI takes over uh now the next thing is okay well so how do you Safeguard it how do you think about this stuff uh many developers have been exposed to generative AI for the first time I've heard that a lot of companies have done like training sessions like here's chat GPT it can write code um it can do you know it can handle data and they're like some developers are having an existential crisis like oh my God my job's going away so this is the meat of the video is here is how to think about uh language models and generative AI as a developer so uh this this comes from a conversation that I actually had with my brother-in-law um who's he's he kind of like followed my footstep like he started he he did his Masters in uh information security and and cyber security so he was a security expert who has pivoted to Cloud uh you know not infrastructure but Cloud development and that's sort of thing and so he's like well what do I do and I said the best way to think about about a language model or a generative AI model is it's just a new kind of interpreter think of it like a new python interpreter think of it like a new Java virtual machine and think about English as a new programming language and he's like oh so it's just a new library I was like yes if you think about this as a new library or a new language and a new kind of interpreter you're golden and like and yeah so basically what I said is like think of it as a very poorly documented language and interpreter and librarian and after that he's just like oh yeah this is like super obvious so uh I hope that this quick little video helps you kind of wrap your head around how to think about it um you know large language models As an interpreter like it can you can call all sorts of functions but a lot of the functions are hidden right you you know some of the functions are brainstorming some of it are writing code some of it is calling apis and that sort of thing so if you're able to Pivot in your mind and think about large language models as a new kind of interpreter and English as a new kind of programming language then I think you're going to be fine um one of the other things that I've seen some developers struggle with is pivoting from um like kind of reactive or imperative coding to more autonomous agents so if you want let me know in the comments if you want me to talk about uh how to make that pivot in your mind anyways thanks for watching um if you got a lot out of this please like subscribe and also consider supporting me on patreon um everything that I do is free low friction no ads um but I do need to eat and this is my full-time job so if I help you please help me you know fair is fair all right cheers
