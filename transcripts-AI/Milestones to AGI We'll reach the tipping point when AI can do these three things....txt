all right so what do I mean when I say AGI this is one of the questions that comes up a lot and like out in the out in the world one of the best defin definitions that I saw of AGI is we'll know when we see it um and however I have put a lot of thought into this and I had an idea as to maybe not a definition but a milestone so let's think of it in terms of what what is the milone and what is a set of achievements based on our current trajectory when we could say anything before this was not AGI and anything after is Agi so this is when I say AGI this is kind of the Milestone that I have in mind so it is when AGI is achieved when machines or robots or AI can collectively and reliably improve every element of the full stack and so what I mean by Stack is Hardware software and AI models so that includes data algorithms and that sort of stuff so uh Anastasia and Tech had uh a couple videos last week about you know chat GPT participating in chip design and uh of course like machine learning has been used in chip design for for ages uh but it's getting better and so for in uh oh and another thing is uh Ai and machine learning has been used in the physical design of robots and other pieces of Hardware as well as learning how to make robots move right like spot and Boston Dynamics and all those they use neural networks to figure out movement now so however it's not there yet it's still is primarily run by humans however once AI can take over all of the hardware design research fabrication and Improvement that's like pillar one and then pillar two is going to be once Ai and machines can take over the whole software stack so that that starts with the operating system you know kernel level up and that includes applications that includes managing entire software repositories and so we saw the first hints of this with chat Dev but imagine a year from now with agent swarms that are capable of testing the entire life cycle of like Windows 13 and the next Linux kernel and the next Unix kernel once I can do that cuz I mean riding operating systems is hard as well as creating new programming languages so once it once it hits that Milestone where it's like hey we have the first operating system that is entirely generated by Ai and the first Hardware platform like server platform and robot platform entirely generated by Ai and then the third pillar is going to be the data and the training algorithms uh and the and the and the deployment of AI models themselves so like if GPT 4 eventually contributes to making GPT 5 for instance and then let's say GPT 5 is multimodal and it also completely end to end creates GPT 6 that'll be the final Milestone so like that's kind when I say AGI that's that's what I mean so before I get to the rest of the video I do have a quick favor to ask so I've mentioned that I have a bunch of books that I'm working on two are well one is ready I just need to like go through the final polishing phase um that's my novel heavy silver and then my systems thinking book I just finished draft three um now before I launch these books I need to have people on my mailing list so that means either substack which is completely free or patreon which has a free tier and the magic number that people tell me is I need to get to 3,000 so I need between those two I need at least 3,000 total people on my mailing list so I've got a th000 on patreon and 500 on substack so I'm halfway there so I just need, 1500 of you to either sign up on the free tier of my patreon or suback which is also free and that'll get me to the Tipping Point where I'm ready to launch my novel and ready to launch systems thinking once it's out so all right back back to the talk so if we hit those three Milestones of of of AI driven self-improvement that's going to be the Tipping Point and so I think in hindsight if if that's the way it plays out cuz it might not play out that way but just taking a first principal's view of okay let's look at the whole stack right Hardware software and then AIML and then everything that goes within those right because we already have data pipelines we've got data curation pipelines but it's still humans setting up those pipelines so like once AI takes over the building of pipelines which is why I'm so excited about the autonomous agent swarm is because each and I and so here's why I'm making this video is because some people have commented and I understand understand their confusion they're like Dave like you're talking about autonomous agent swarms this is not AGI no not right now but it is it is a major component because autonomy is one of the characteristics that you'd expect of AGI full autonomy and that means self-direction self-correction and self-improvement full autonomy has all three of those and it just doesn't need humans anymore it doesn't need humans to tell it what to do it doesn't need humans for maintenance it doesn't need humans for you know whatever man I'm getting toasty cuz I'm talking so fast so uh right so that's why I'm so excited about autonomous agent swarms and uh oh also I just I want to say that I get a total kick out of all you people that are like is Dave outside the funniest comment yet was who decided to upgrade him to legs really like that was hilarious I was like anyways so where we're at right now is these tiny agents and we're trying to figure out how to instantiate them and how to get them communicating with each other but then of course like there's some underlying model improvements that need to be made cuz I suspect that GPT for Turbo while it can help um with with algorithm research and Hardware research and design it probably is just not quite smart enough to do every step every level uh uh entirely on its own now again if it can help and accelerate it great that is one piece of the puzzle that's a keystone uh technology to help make it go faster so anyways thanks for watching I'm really excited and uh yeah let me know what you think you guys seem to like these kinds of riffing videos so let me know in the comments like subscribe follow me on LinkedIn patreon so on and so forth uh you know the drill take care
