so we've had some very interesting overnight developments I woke up early at 6:00 a.m. uh Eastern Time to find that at the 11th Hour a deal has been pulled out so zi Nadella announces on Twitter that uh that emit Shear is coming on as CEO at open aai and that Sam and Greg Brockman are coming on to a Microsoft research under a new AI uh division at Microsoft so here's the news Sam Alman isn't coming back to open AI he's out he couldn't come to a deal with the board EMT Shear is in as an interim CEO so this is this is really interesting because imit here was of twitch so that's not necessarily exactly who you'd expect to be leading a an open source or quasi open source uh research company focused on AI but this is someone with uh more experience at a larger company so that could bode well looking at it from a business perspective um it seems like the board has reasserted itself so I think we can um at least safely assume that uh that in the long run that ilas s and the rest of the open AI board will be adhering to the Charter the original Mission of to create AGI uh for the benefit of all mankind um and I know that I just grafted on some uh some NASA lingo there uh you know cuz that was one of the things that they said when they landed on the moon For All Mankind so anyways uh anyways that is kind of where it's going right now um it's really interesting so let me just Riff on kind of my reaction to all this cuz this is actually a really interesting turn of events and I'm not entirely surprised I didn't predict this but taking a step back the fact that Sachi Nadella was on stage with Sam mman at Dev day was a very public signal that they were aligned in terms of the business Direction um Sam Alman and Greg Brockman helping to um really productize these language Technologies to create you know the new assistance endpoint um and that sort of thing you know one of the criticisms that I had and that other people have was that open AI is Dev day was like a Microsoft product launch now that might make me sound like I'm critical of Microsoft I'm actually a really big fan of Microsoft I have a lot of friends over at Microsoft and every time I talk to people at Microsoft especially the higher ups that I've talked to they are some of the Far and Away most intelligent people that I've talked to and also the most principled people that I've talked to so Microsoft is a company that is very aggressively working towards becoming carbon neutral and zero waste um also last year or the year before they actually disabled and took down emotional inference technology like big brother type of Technology on principle um so like Microsoft in terms of big Tech is a very ethical company and I was actually I was talking with my wife about this of all people and the reasons there are structural reasons that Microsoft is like this and that they're not like uh not exactly like other big tech companies and the reason is because they serve the business industry Microsoft is primarily a business software company which means that move fast and break things doesn't work for Microsoft yes they want to be an industry leader yes they want to be disruptive but businesses don't like disruptions uh it's like a fangy rule of acquisition you know drastic disruptions are bad for business uh you know C some creative destruction is good for business but Microsoft sees the writing on the wall and they don't want to you know drastically and suddenly release technology that's going to send most of their customers out of business so they're releasing things in in such a way that gives the the market time to adapt and so one thing that I hope is that by bringing Sam Alman and Greg Brockman into the Microsoft Family where they're going to be among peers they're going to learn a lot because I don't think either of them has ever worked for a company this big um and so they're going to cynically you could call it golden handcuffs so this is this is a business term from like the high-end business world where you get a you get a deal that's so good that you can't say no but it comes with constraints that you can't get away from so will this ultimately feel like golden handcuffs to Sam Alman and Greg Brockman who knows but uh put it this way this this very uh very direct irly puts Sai Nadella over top of Sam Alman and Greg Brockman um and so it sounds like they're probably going to be a few layers down they'll probably report directly to um a sea-level uh person uh or you know someone a deputy CTO maybe or maybe they are going to be new Deputy CTO so this this is a really interesting thing about uh Microsoft is that they they have a very powerful internal culture like an internal startup culture and so they deputize they they have what's called Deputy CTO which are basically like CEOs of internal companies of Microsoft so I wouldn't be surprised if Sam Alman ends up as a deputy CTO or or reporting directly to a deputy CTO to head up some of these these new ideas because it's very clear that you know like if you go back to earlier this year when Sam Alman said that you know AGI or you know next Generation AI uh could generate a hundred trillion doar worth of of of uh revenue or value and he wants to capture most of it well Microsoft is actually a better place to do that than a than a than a nonprofit research company um why because Microsoft is one of the companies that I think is going to be you know a trillion dollar company or a 10 trillion dollar company or whatever because they are so perfectly positioned to make the most of uh the advancements of AI this you know more than meta more than Apple more than Google because um generative AI is going to accelerate business so much so I think Microsoft is in the prime position to to to reap the most rewards of uh artificial intelligence and the ramp up to AGI now I also think that like I said because Microsoft um is a highly principled company I think it's also the correct company for these guys to learn a little bit more about how to be responsible in the business world now this is not necessarily how to be responsible in the human world but Sachin Nadella is very clearly a long-term thinker um and what I mean by that is you look at the fact that Sachi Nadella is having them double down on open source models closed Source models they're doubling down on the hardware uh on the cloud on like everything when you look at the all the business strategies that Microsoft is doing um very clearly a long-term strategic thinker uh so ultimately I think this is going to be really good for Microsoft I hope that it's going to be good for for us I think that this is ultimately a very large setback for open Ai and the reason is because you know with the with with the the charismatic power that Sam Alman brought that's going to be difficult to replace so like there's been a few comments on on videos saying that like Sam Alman is replaceable I don't know that he is because this is a guy with a very unique pedigree he came up through y combinator he's a Silicon Valley darling he gets a lot of attention a lot of investment he just went on a world tour he's he's been you know highly praised so like this is this is a guy that is um pretty unique in the world uh and so I sus ECT honestly this is just my gut check right now I suspect that open AI will never recover from this I think that open AI has been forever changed um now will they be will open AI be able to um maintain its dominance its lead with just the power of ilas setav and will they be able to attract other I think that it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that that Microsoft is going to get a lot of open AI top talent that they're going to follow Sam and Greg um I think that I think that um kind of this is how I characterize it to my wife I was like worst case scenario open ey gets sold for parts which honestly if they can't meet their obligations to Microsoft then you know people are going to keep leaving it's going to become a nonviable company um or it's just going to fall further and further behind and become irrelevant um at which point it might either I don't know what the what the contract what the deal is but I would not be surprised if what all of open AI what they have just ends up you know just getting absorbed into Microsoft because of this um now does does open aai have anything that is truly and intrinsically unique the rule of thumb is that you know open source is only a few months behind closed Source open AI is at most two years ahead of the curve and I say at most I think that you can make a pretty strong argument that they're maybe six months ahead of everyone else so it's like okay well how much is this worth and also when you look at all of the all of the incremental improvements that open AI keeps integrating into their models it all comes from public research it all comes from Carnegie melon and Stanford and MIT and all the papers coming out across the world including China for all the algorithmic improvements um you know Microsoft is the one that that uh published LM infinite or maybe not LM infinite but um but the other one uh the the billion token one so you know all this all this public uh research is what's is what's driving us forward and closer to AI um you know the belief that open AI had some Secret Sauce some magic sauce I don't think it's true um now obviously that Ser that that serves their narrative uh if it's like oh well come to open AI because we're the best in the world and we're the only ones who can do this it's like but that's not true look at how fast Elon Musk had had uh x. trained grock it took them a few months um now he claims that it's better than chat GPT but who knows um at on the same token uh Google has Gemini coming and it's multimodal and a whole bunch of other stuff so like all the like once you have enough money like you throw it at like there's no there's no there's no magic here it's just math so here's one interpretation of this this is going to be a good thing because it gives all the competition a chance to catch up and competition is going to be uh better for everyone in this respect because then it's like okay for instance I I canceled my Claude uh subscription because I didn't like the way that they were going they need to do some serious work on their alignment um and if they fix it great I'll I'll go back Google's working on Gemini uh Elon Musk is is working on grock um Microsoft has Bing which you know is based on gp4 anyways um I'm sure meta is coming out with something Apple's coming out with something so in the grand scheme of things this is going to lead to a more competitive environment now on a safety and Alignment perspective there's this is both good and bad because it's good in that these companies are going to have lots and lots of structural incentives to one make their AI smarter and more efficient and more aligned and safe safer and they'll be able to compare notes and so from a from an alignment and safety perspective you're going to have these different companies kind of feeling out in different directions that's on the good side on the bad side this leads to a comp competitive environment that could ultimately lead to a terminal race condition which I've talked about in my recent videos so it remains to be seen how this will all shake out but I think that I think that this is kind of the death nail for open Ai and I think that it is kind of an intrinsic uh backslide from here because they just don't have the clout without Sam Alman without someone very charismatic bringing in the investment bringing in the trust they're not going to be able to afford the best talent they're not going to be able to keep the best talent and all that good talent is just going to get um it's it's called Talent poaching they're all going to get poached by the rest of Silicon Valley and this is where this is where open AI is insistence on everyone who works at openi open AI has to live in the Bay Area is really going to come back and bite them in the ass because guess who else is in the Bay Area area literally everyone else in the tech sector um so that means it's like well I already moved to San Francisco for open AI so might as well just work for Google might as well just go work for Microsoft because I think they have I think they have a office in Palo Alto anyways so there's all kinds of other tech companies in the Bay area that are going to be saying hey open AI is kind of a kind of a mess right now so you know the the mass employee Exodus I don't think they're going to recover from this um I think it was really messy so talking to a good friend of mine an Insider said who who characterized it this way it wasn't it wasn't Ilia leading a coup it was Ilia doing what the board was supposed to do and then Sam Alman and Greg Brockman led the coup which was like putting the pressure to uh using Twitter to get people to leave to to Garner support to you know get Microsoft engaged to get VC's engaged um because when you look at who was making it very public it was Sam Alman and all the people favoring Sam Alman now granted some of that's organic right I'm not saying that he was the ring leader but the point is is that is that trying to overcome the board's will and get back into open Ai and going against the wishes of the board that was the coup um Ting Sam Alman if again the board was acting in good faith and and trying to adhere to their Charter then that was not the coup that was them doing what they were supposed to do either way I don't think that this is going to end well for open AI I think that this is ultimately going to be a good for Microsoft a good thing for Google um and a good thing for some of the other big tech companies oh and so one of the biggest questions that I get is you know is this going to be a setback for AGI no um if anything this accelerates the timelines because now the competition is even hotter because open AI is is going to be hemorrhaging Talent um and and that's going to be a shot in the arm for places like Google and Microsoft and meta and everyone else and so now they're all just going to be turning it up to 11 and they're all going to be using this as as an opportunity to Pivot and double down and maybe change their strategies because now instead of instead of the business landscape being we got to catch up to open AI now it's like okay instead of trying to keep Pace with open AI let's like re-evaluate our Direction that's kind of how I that's kind of how I read it and that's how I kind of anticipate it to to fall out um I will reiterate my personal opinion that I think that Dev day was an embarrassment and a departure from the ethos of open AI a lot of of you in the comments have said that like well no it's appropriate to to get alignment and all that stuff out of Dev day yes if you accept the principle that that open a was trying to Pivot to be a commercial uh software company but that's not their Charter that's not the point um and so what I mean is is Dev day is fundamentally misaligned or was fundamentally misaligned with the mission of open AI um that's kind of my take and I think that what we're seeing here is a uh what I call a radical realignment of of initiatives and and and values and so the radical realignment here is that that Sam Alman and Greg Brockman were clearly wanting to take open AI in a more commercial Direction uh ilas s and the board wanted to keep it in a more of a research Direction so now Sam Alman is where probably he belongs with Microsoft along with along with his buddy Greg and the open AI board got what they wanted but the cost was very very high so that's kind of my evaluation of the news waking up first thing to all this so let me know what you think in the comments and um yeah let's figure it out let's see what happens from here uh needless to say it's very interesting either way
