So lately there's been a lot of talk about accelerationism and effective altruism uh dumer ISM has been in the news for a while but in particular with uh the attempted coup at open Ai and the firing of several board members including two of whom were effective altruists this has brought the conversation about accelerationism uh back into the conversation and of course Sam Alman uh tweeted what I think about a year ago or earlier this year no one can out accelerate me so we need to talk about how these various ideologies form why they're important and how they intersect with technology so here are some sources for this video I just want to show that like I'm not making this stuff up and if you want to look into it um go for it uh sapiens by yval know Harari the status game by Will store uh how family structure drives ideology by the channel what ifal his America's Freedom Is A Lie by wise crack uh debt a new religion by wise crack and then seven emotions that push the world also by what ifal hisst um there's more but these are probably the most Salient and also that's like I don't know 30 40 hours worth of of reading and watching uh by itself so moving right along first we need to unpack narratives tribes and Status games so when I say a narrative what I mean by a narrative is just a story or set of stories that we use to make sense of the world so this is why some of you who've been the internet for a while might remember the arguments uh particularly when atheism was kind of more of a Hot Topic where people would say well science is just a religion too and that's not necessarily true but you know people would say well you have to take you know scientific Publications on faith and blah blah blah and what I realized is that actually what they have in common is that they're both narratives so science is a narrative uh religion is a narrative philosophy is a narrative as well and what I mean by by that is that all of these are conveyed as Stories the history of science is a series of stories that we use to make sense of Science and that's how we used to teach the lessons of science uh and in fact every scientific paper every publication is a miniature story saying this is what we did this is these are the this is how we did it and this is uh the information these are the conclusions that we came from this little miniature scientific story that I just told you uh likewise philosophy is uh very often there certainly the history of philosophy is taught taught through narratives through little anecdotes vignettes and stories uh likewise religion is is taught the same way now you might say well the chief difference is that is that religion is fictional um that many of the stories many of the parables are in no way you know you like yes you can say they're basically myths it's mythology uh but likewise philosophy is not much different because most of the thought experiments are complete fictions uh and so this the the similarity and difference between philosophy and religion is far narrower than the difference between uh the the narratives of Science and religion but the point is is that that is how they exist in the human brain um you know science does not exist exist outside of human brains neither does philosophy neither does religion these all exist only by virtue of the fact that they are in human brains um and they are stored as narratives which is why you can multiple versions of reality in your head because it's your brain doesn't handle it as there is one you know one true version of reality your brain holds it as a series of narratives so understanding this is pretty Central to the rest of the video the next concept that you need to be familiar with and I've mentioned this before is epistemic tribes so an epistemic tribe is just a group of people with similar narratives or with shared narratives and so the simplest example of this is you might say like all Protestants have some shared narratives but it's not even fully true but that's an example uh likewise you might say like uh people from Michigan have some shared narratives about Michigan Americans have shared narratives about America uh capitalists have shared narratives about capitalism uh so that's pretty much all you need to know about an epistemic tribe one thing that I will point out though is that many people call them Echo Chambers but that is a normative uh gatekeeping tactic used by the institutional establishment to say well we are the Arbiters of the only true narrative we are the we are the dominant epistemic tribe and therefore will'll pathologize anyone who disagrees with us and just say that's an echo chamber but this fails to recognize that that epistemic tribes are a natural and healthy phenomenon and epistemic boundaries can break down along any line you can have uh linguistic boundaries so for instance you have the English-speaking world and then you have the chinesee speaking world and then you have uh you know the french- speaking world so epistemic Tri are Perfectly Natural um there's geographical boundaries as well so you know information tends to uh stay local until it goes viral on the internet the internet has really changed our relationship with information but yeah so you get the idea epistemic tribes are a perfectly natural phenomenon it's not just Boomers on Facebook which is what this graphic is supposed to represent so then the third primary uh phenomenon that you need to understand is status games so status games is basically the observation and there a lot of evidence that support this is that social status is the primary objective function of the human brain um and there's a lot of the evidence to support this is that when push comes to shove uh people will make the choice to uh Elevate their status rather than a lot of material gains so a piece of evidence of this from the from the book is that given the option between a new title a new prestigious title at work and a raise people will more often choose the T the the title something that confers more social status more than just a basic raise they want they want to The Prestige of the title and there's literally thousands of examples in in the book but that's just one example um another thing is that there are objective empirical benefits from having higher Social Status and so what I mean by that is that social status is the strongest predictor of longevity of health of uh sexual Fitness of um happiness like it predicts pretty much everything good um so more social status is better now within the status game there are five key principles um that he talks about and there's so there's virtue games dominance games and success games which I'll talk about each of those in just a minute um in more detail because uh in particular virtue games are what is at stake here when we're talking about dorismar positionism and all the other uh dispositions all the other ideologies around technology but uh one what I'll conclude with on this slide is that there are tight games and then there are broad games and so what a tight game is a tight game is where uh the game becomes more rigid the definition of success is more exclusionary um and there's a lot more scrutiny and homogeneity and I'll give some examples of tight games in just a moment you are familiar with tight games you have seen them multiple times throughout history but then there's also broad games and so this is the opposite basically when there are multiple paths to success um and there's no one true conformance or no one true path um broad games uh create uh more inclusivity and um and are also less violent so moving on success games this is the most familiar kind of uh game because particularly in America we have refined it to an exact science of saying like money is good therefore get more money um that's capitalism in a nutshell that's neoliberalism in a nutshell um conspicuous consumption by accumulating wealth accumulating Prestige buying more property having a fancy car social media following Success is Not Just money um having more followers on social media is a is a way of conspicuously demonstrating success um and this is pretty welln pretty well established so I don't need to perseverate on this slide uh terribly long again you're familiar with this probably dominance games you've also seen this um so it's basically comes down to physical prowess and and intimidation and physical dominance in all of the ways that it manifests in terms of social structures where you see this law enforcement Sports Athletics military uh at the gym as well uh prisons uh very much uh engage in dominance games this is the most Primal form of game that we have so this is you know you can see dominance games happening in the animal kingdom uh such as between chimps Dolphins gorillas uh so on and it's about about aggression sexual prowess physical Beauty um and establishing a hierarchy based on very Primal um tactics and strategies again you've seen this it's very familiar there's no mystery here and then finally virtue games you have seen virtue games as well um so virtue games are about Prestige and piety or or conformance to certain value structures um and this leads to purity testing it also leads to Virtue signaling um but it is also one of the most sophisticated games that we play because it requires a lot of social intelligence a lot of uh social uh political Savvy um and also it requires you to remember things about people um and concoct and engage with very very sophisticated narratives and some of those narratives are very very complex um so for instance like the qinon crowd that is an example of a virtue game that has a very Byzantine narrative so the Q andon narrative is a is a very complex set of stories uh likewise antivaxers that is a virtue game that is about a very complex set of narratives um but an example of virtue signaling is you the the quintessential post of an antivaxer Mom saying I'm a good mom so of course I don't vax my baby um and that is that is an example of virtue signaling and then the purity testing in those and I'll go over those in in Greater detail in just a moment but purity testing is about uh is about basically scrutinizing people um to to say are you one of us or not and purity testing and virtue signaling gets more intense when you have a tight uh virtue game so uh purity testing the the most broad spectrum quintessential example today is cancel culture which Left Right everyone does cancel culture and cancel culture is also nothing new um the Spanish Inquisition and burning witches at the stake that was a form of cancel culture it is the same exact psychology which is basically you don't conform to our narrow set of values and standards therefore you are now expelled from the group um and so like the fact that that people that have been canceled on social media um they often lose uh their livelihood some of them lose all their friends their family their support and in the worst cases they end up killing themselves and so cancel culture is uh is a modern version of basically burning people at the stake it is it is a it is a uh what's called a social level of execution and so the idea of purity testing is you're constantly looking for things that someone has done wrong in order to to to discern whether or not you're a member of the group we've seen this countless times uh throughout recent history and and older history so the Red Scare and McCarthyism was an example of purity testing it's how American are you um and of course you know China with the social credit system is now working on just making it State policy and and and doing purity test testing on conformance to the ccp's party line um doing it with AI uh so this is why purity testing is bad and purity testing is well it's I'm not going to say that it's always bad but it is a sign of a tight game and tight games lead to violence and Injustice and then finally virtue signaling um this this this particular one was was good to uh to make look how inclusive I am this is superficial and performative demonstrations of your group performance um so virtue signaling often people will do this in a way to say they they'll do it as cheaply as possible to say like look how aligned I am with this ideology um this is in in contrast with costly signaling and so for instance an example of costly signaling is going to church every every Sunday um in order to demonstrate your adherence to uh you know the the virtues of being a good Christian because basically you sacrifice an entire day or an entire morning um uh in order to to show look I am I am a member of this group and I am conforming to its values whereas particularly on the internet um superficial gestures such as just you know uttering a few catchphrases is pretty much all you need to do in order to vert uh to Signal your virtues now I don't want to pathologize Virtue signaling because again when you look at status games and if you understand and accept that social status is part of the human condition purity testing and virtue signaling are part of it um but they only become pathological when the game's tighten to the point that you start wanting to excommunicate and execute people either uh literally or figuratively okay so now that you have the groundwork let's talk about some popular examples that are in mainstream American culture today so on the left uh equality is the primary virtue to signal and so equality is good therefore more equality is better and so whenever when you start to look at the the fact that the left is emphasizing equality that's why uh Concepts like Universal basic income um is is popular uh you know and this is also about positive rights and so the what positive rights mean is um that's an entitlement and so if you say like well everyone should have a right to education and Health Care um and internet and have a right to a job those are what are called positive rights which is the government should enforce and ensure and guarantee that you have access to certain things and this is converse to negative rights which we'll talk about in just a second um and in in the most extreme cases when the game Narrows you end up doubling down on equality at all costs including putting the cart before the horse um where you basically draw moral equival equivalency between all because any suggestion of inequality becomes taboo becomes perverse um and is is impure and so when you say equality above all else you end up making really kind of dumb assertions such as like well men and women are just intrinsically equal uh at an endogenous level which is like not provable and and demonstra demonstrably false men are taller that is something that you can observe men are stronger that is something you can observe um and I'm saying on average um but when you put the principle of equality above all else you end up having to deny these very obvious facts um likewise in the most extreme cases as we've seen with the uh recent violence in the Middle East um they they purified it to the point where they just say Hamas was justified and I will say that that uh that deliberate rape and murdering children is never Justified I don't care who's doing it um but because we've gotten to the point where um where equality above all else is the is the is the the point of the hard left or the the radical left you end up with these really asinine beliefs um and oh by the way no group is safe um on the right Freedom it freedom is good therefore more freedom is better and so you have the idea of of equality versus freedom is the primary tension in uh America but also all Western cultures Europe has its own struggles over this and so when you talk about Liberty or individual Freedom this is about negative rights it's about um it's not about entitlement to things it's about freedom from tyranny oppression coercion uh government overreach and so this is why you end up with the the the thing like taxes are theft um because freedom in an absolute sense means that you don't have any obligations to anyone but of course that is an extreme version of of that principle of Freedom taken to an absolute extreme especially if you if you uh value freedom to the exclusion of equality and so this is the fundamental tension um again in all Western liberan Li liberal societies of what is the balance of equality versus freedom but because we're in such a polarized uh period of time people take both to extremes and so this is where you see libertarian uh you know ideology saying like just get rid of the government altogether um get rid of taxes all together and these are extreme positions that are completely indefensible they don't make logical sense there's no historical PR for it um but because they have doubled down on these principles of Freedom at all cost to the exclusion of all else you end up with really extreme ideologies just the same that on the left if you put equality Above All Else and to the exclusion of all else you end up with really extreme ideologies uh conservatism is tradition Above All Else uh tradition is good therefore more tradition is better um and I've literally had people tell me women ought to know their place so the story behind this was I was uh driving back from the mountains and I was at a gas station and there was a woman struggling with the gas pump and she came in to get help from the from the gas station attendant and he just looked at me after she left and he's like women shouldn't be allowed to drive and I was just like wow what century is this um so anyways but again tradition does have its value but if you double down on tradition for tradition's own sake and you put that to the exclusion of all else you end up with really asinine backwards beliefs I think you get the idea uh progressivism is change for the sake of all change um so change is good therefore more change is better um this quotation was actually said to me by a friend in high school um she said we should lower the standards um so that more people can be firefighters if they want to and um no the the physical requirements to be a firefighter uh are there for a reason you don't want someone who weighs 110b trying to pull you out of a burning building um so again when you double down on the idea that maybe change is good and therefore more changes better and you become a Hardline or or you take that to an extreme you end up saying really things that are that are completely indefensible because you have doubled down on a single principle and then finally religion so uh most most religious people are fine oh and one thing that I need to say is what I'm talking about here are the extremes I'm not talking about the reasonable people uh reasonableness is on a bell curve most people are reasonable what I'm talking about in all of these cases is any ideology taken to an extreme so I just need to say that cuz like just because someone is religious doesn't mean they're a crusader so um however there have been periods of times where games have narrowed and you end up with things like Crusaders um you know Jesus said love thy neighbor and you know tolerate and turn the other cheek but then you also get Crusaders which doesn't make a damn bit of sense but this is the principle of God is good particularly my God therefore more God is better um the Romans felt much the same way and the the fact that uh that the Roman R Catholic Church evolved from the Roman Empire it really kind of makes sense why the Roman Catholic Church is the way that it or at least was the way that it was um anyways Deus Vault God wills it um so you see the pattern here um something is good therefore more of something is better this is the universal pattern of all extreme ideologies now let's talk about composite identities so at the beginning I talked about epistemic tribes most people are well everyone is a member of multiple epistemic tribes I am a uh White American of Jewish ancestry who lives on the East Coast who is you know blah blah blah blah blah someone watching this I know that I have a global audience some of you might be Hindu some of you might be Catholic some of you might be whatever right like there's all kinds of people from all over the world and when people have a healthy well-rounded set of epistemic tribes that they are a member of and are not doubling down on each one that is how you avoid extremism and so if you have a singular identity where your identity is entirely wrapped up in a single epistemic tribe and everyone you know is wrapped up in a single epistemic tribe that is what leads to extremism and so a like a well-rounded person is someone who is a member of generally around five or more epistemic tribes and so if you say like well I'm a white guy I'm white I'm a man I'm an American that's three right there and that's before even getting into like my preferences like I identify with technology I identify with a bunch of other stuff um and so the more well-rounded you are the more epistemic tribes you are a member of and also the more Nuance you are required to have because some of those tribal identities are going to be in tension with each other however if you use purity testing and virtue signaling to eliminate all tension to eliminate all Nuance that is how you get to purified extremism so now let's te talk about technological ideologies because these are no different from any other ideology doomeris AI is going to kill us all um so the idea here is that Doom is inevitable therefore more Doom is better um and the idea is that this is a principle that people double down on and it becomes a virtue game where you have to Virtue signal around how much you believe in P Doom just because like okay people by and large agree that like the the the chance of catastrophe is between one and 50% but some people say ah well I'm going to double down on this and say that it's 99% certain or that it's almost certain or that it's absolutely inevitable and so this is an example of purity testing and virtue signaling that leads to dorismar up in this dorest ideology and you have no other epistemic tribes to counterbalance you you end up just doubling down and you say okay well optimism is actually bad like if you pathologize something that is not congruent in the same way that um that leftist demonize and pathologize any form of inequality um including earned uh privileges or you know endogenous privileges like you're supposed to be ashamed of anything any advantage that you have according to the left because equality Above All Else and inequality is bad likewise with downslide towards Extinction or worse that is why these people are incentivized to seemingly hope and pray for something that is going to be abjectly miserable for themselves and even to avoid talking about Solutions or antidotes utopianism Perfection is attainable resistance is feudal I don't think I have to talk about this much more but the idea that um that there is a an idealized perfect State um that you can reach for um that's not necessarily a good idea um because one person's definition of Utopia is going to be different from everyone else's definition and uh the Borg from Star Trek are an are an example of um of achieving that perfect state that perfect Society at all costs because according to the Borg a perfect Society is one with no disharmony whatsoever where everyone is homogeneous everyone is treated equal um and everyone is uh 100% collectivist And so you know you're biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own um I say this as someone who is who is myself a utopianist so I am aware of the tension here but I as a member of multiple epistemic tribes I am aware of the problems of taking that particular ideology to an extreme and so I temper my definition of Utopia as high social Mobility um highi High individual liberty and high standard of living I feel like that's a pretty reasonable definition of Utopia but again I am aware that that if I were to distill that identity into a pure form it would basically be the Borg and then finally accelerationism technology is good therefore more technology is better um this leads to really silly statements like you can't out accelerate me because again if technology is good and more technology is better and you double down on this you end up saying well maybe Nothing Else Matters um and so this is also called techno optimism um but the thing here is if you believe in this then that means you inevitably have to pathologize um people who are advocating for safety people who maybe are skeptical of technology and so when you when you have to again it's about that dichotomy it's whatever you optimize for you have to pathologize the opposite if you become an extreme and so again the assertion that technology is good therefore more technology is better this is an eminently defensible position which is why I understand Tech uh accelerationist um is because yes like I am someone who uh used to unironically say the only thing that has um that has increased the standard of living for people is technology uh politics economics none of those things in the grand scheme of things has increased increased our uh quality of life the fact that I'm able to sit here and record a video on my computer on the internet and play video games and do other things that's all due to technology the fact that I am alive right now is due to Medical Technology because there have been several things in my life that would have killed me without medical technology and most of you watching actually probably wouldn't be alive right now to watch this without medical technology and medical advancements over the last century why because we would have died of tuberculosis or polio or you know staff infection or whatever um and so yes technology is good therefore more technology is better is an eminently defensible belief however when it gets purified and you say more technology at all cost and everyone who disagrees with me is wrong or insane or whatever that is when it becomes pathological that is when it becomes an extremist ideology um and so then incrementalism so this is deliberation and cautiousness is good therefore more deliberation and cautiousness is better um again this is kind of like Whatever Whatever Gets someone the most social status in their particular epistemic tribe so I picked Dr Roman Chow who is a big voice in caution and deliber I happen to agreee with her because again I am a member of multiple epistemic tribes and I'm not doubling down on anyone I agree with pretty much all of these all of these ideologies that I've that I've talked about so like what I mean is like yes there is there is the potential for catastrophe I'm one who talks about terminal race conditions as one of the most dangerous things that could threaten us but I'm not going to keep saying that until I get on the Ted stage likewise I do want to see a utopian future but I'm not going to I'm not going to say let's do this at all costs and then technology is good therefore more technology is better yes I agree with this but not to the exclusion of all else and likewise caution is good but not to the exclusion of all else so what are the general principles that we can extract from this first radical narratives are bad um people that are calling for a reimagining of society or a radical restructuring of society that is an extremist ideology and I picked the French Revolution to represent this because while we valorized the French Revolution in hindsight it was extremely destructive and extremely bloody and extremely terrifying we don't want to repeat that um and there have been other radical restructurings of society um throughout the world uh Soviet communism the people's revolution in China um the American Revolution the American Civil War whenever someone calls for a radical restructuring of society and that happens it is very bloody and a lot of people lose um and so I want to caution against any radical narratives um technological or otherwise this is a universal pattern whether it's the woke left or the Maga right all of this is about that same pattern of X is good therefore more X is better I've already kind of driven this point home so I don't think I need to perseverate on this but this pattern has existed across uh all of time in space for the entire like the entire globe and the entire history of humanity this pattern keeps emerging this is why you had the Salem Witch Trials this is why you had the Spanish Inquisition this is why you had the Crusades is when a game tightens and you end up with too much purity testing and too much virtue signaling you end up with extremism and you end up doubling down on a on a single principle X is good therefore more X is better dual use one of the key things about technology and this is a hardcore like unassailable truth is that all technology is dual use so an example is f material you can use uh you can use it to make nuclear weapons you can also use it to make nuclear power plants very powerful technology either way you slice it it is dual use artificial intelligence is no different some of you probably saw the news broke yesterday that the Pentagon is going Full Tilt towards autonomous uh AI based weapons that will have discretion to use lethal Force without humans in the loop AI is dual use so when someone like Sam Alman says a GI is going to make the world an infinitely better place and completely ignores the fact that AI could also like be used as a tool of tyranny and oppression that is a single-minded view synthetic biology likewise um you know there's medications out there that we can take there's all kinds of things that that emerge from the same technology that created the covid pandemic um so you can use you can use synthetic biology to cure diseases or make new ones this is a hardcore unassailable uh fact um but again some people kind of double down on one side or the other um so what do I call myself tongue and cheek I say I'm a car are carlist realism um and so he this is George Carlin who was a comedian he said Inside every cynic is a disappointed idealist I'm not going to spend too much time on this I just thought it was funny so I included it near the end but uh the conclusion here is like acceleration and coin they are extreme extreme versions of of these ideologies that I talked about that have just doubled down on a very narrow principle and the game is still presently narrowing because the stakes are high and they're getting higher so that's one of the key things that you need to know is is that's what makes these games narrow or tighten is when the stakes go up and so for instance during wartime the stakes go up and so like what it means to be a good American becomes a very narrow definition when we're at War when when every nation is at War um but in both cases for you know the the two Polar Opposites accelerationism and dorismar and flat earthers rooted in fictional narratives the idea that that humanity is going to is going to be wiped out by by AI there has been zero evidence that I am aware of and please correct me if I'm wrong but that any of the the the frontier models that we're talking about want to eradicate Humanity I haven't seen any evidence of it um so like where are they getting this idea they're using their imagination to get this idea likewise when Sam Alman and other people say AGI is going to you know make everything infinitely better there's not really any evidence of that yet except for the principle that technology is good therefore more technology is better yes AI is helping in many ways but it can also hurt in a lot of ways um there are winners and losers in these status games and if you View accelerationism and dorismar to the technology or anything in the real world if you just view them as virtue games as status games there are people that win the ones that end up getting on the Ted stage for instance um and but there are real consequences to these virtue games and so what I mean by that is look at the fact that uh you know McCarthyism uh the satanic Panic uh these are all examples of virtue games that had very real consequences for people burning witches at the stake has very real consequences for people cancel culture has very real consequences for people so we want to avoid having a narrowing uh set of virtue games or status games because that is what leads to extremism and that's what leads to violence and um and Injustice so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this I know that this was probably a very spicy take but I think that it is time to advance this narrative and talk about some of these things as primarily human phenomenon social phenomenon and as many of you have said and pointed out aligning humans is the hard part aligning machines was never going to be the hard part it was always aligning Humanity was the hard part and that's what this video is about cheers
