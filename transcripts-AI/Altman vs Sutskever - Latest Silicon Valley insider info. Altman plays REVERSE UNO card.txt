hey folks David Shapiro here I just wanted to give a really quick uh kind of update uh today's thoughts on Sam Alman and the board and some some thoughts about all the conversations I've been having so the tldr it seems like the primary point of contention has been between Sam Alman and ilas sver and the general gist is that they're they either achieved AGI or some level of sentients um or are close and the fundamental disagreement is over what to do next now Ilia has repeatedly said keep the the most powerful models absolutely closed Source do not open source them do not publicize them uh study them you know basically keep it keep it cloistered keep it sequestered for as long as possible and Sam has been a little bit more in favor of Open Source or you know moving in a more commercial Direction kind of you know releasing it into the wild and it seems that this was the fundamental point of contention now when you look at the uh what looks like a coup led by Ilia um and by all accounts it was almost like a rage like a like a desk flip kind of thing where it escalated very quickly he was very angry um According to some of the leaks and the reports that I've seen um and so then he quickly rallied the board and marshaled a firing uh you know they fired and then Sach Nadella of Microsoft was angry all the open AI investors are angry and even it sounds like a fair chunk of the open AI employees were angry which is really interesting not surprising I mean he's very charismatic very popular and so my read of this situation then is that this ouster this attempted ouster because it looks like it's very possible that Sam will be coming back and there's a lot of people who want him to come back it looks like this was a grievous miscalculation by Ilia um or maybe it was a moment of intense passion or anger or whatever and when you take a step back and because you know I've I've made some of my criticisms of Sam Alman clear but now I'm wondering if some of the because like when you look at what he used to say about AGI and stuff and then he tempered it I wonder if it was actually being kind of forced by the board and Ilia to to step back because one of my biggest criticisms of open Ai and Elon Musk as others is open AI was was you know originally open source and now it isn't and I wonder if if the board resigns it looks like they might if Sam Alman comes back if they're going to move back more towards an open source model now I've talked to some people in the uh in the AI safety community and they say that that is one of the worst possible things that you could do is go Full Tilt open source now I think that I don't think that Sam Alman is going to open source gp4 and then G GPT 5 that doesn't make sense but I think that he's more amable to uh to putting things into into that pipeline especially when you look at like some of the tweets and some of the other things that that um all the all the Reddit investigators and all my patreon supporters have have sced up it really looks like there's been some back and forth about very very particularly close Source versus open source or profit motive versus nonprofit motive it seems like that's kind of what it all hinges around now the thing that concerns me though is that the investors and Microsoft really really wanted Sam back um so that tells me that there is a commercial motivation or you know maybe self-preservation or profit motive um but I will also say that doesn't necessarily mean that safety and profit are mutually exclusive it is a little bit suspicious um but it remains to be seen uh how that'll turn out exactly and kind of who you know who said what and who did what so long story short we don't really know what's going to happen just yet it does look like there is a tremendous amount of energy to bring Sam back it seems like um you know investors Microsoft and open AI employees all rallied to bring him back so maybe you know maybe Ilia just really drastically uh miscalculated here so who knows but I've also heard on the grape vine that Google is planning on making the most of this uh misstep um and I'm sure that I'm sure that some people at open AI are just going to leave for good that they're going to get poached by Microsoft or meta or Google because they're done with the drama and so talking with other people uh from an outside perspective you know whether your team Sam or team Ilia or team Microsoft or whatever this just looks bad it looks really immature um this is the company that is supposed to be creating AGI and supposed to be doing it safely and they have this like HBO level drama that doesn't bode well like this is this drastically reduces um the the the perception the pr the public relations of open AI regardless of whose fault it was and uh so talking to one person they said like maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing if if this ultimately leads to Microsoft acquiring open AI outright because Microsoft is a far more stable far more mature company that is not going to have this level of drama and like you know just when you when you when you take a big step back and you say okay what is the dream team that you imagine for creating AGI and solving super alignment the dream team that you imagine doesn't behave like this doesn't get all twisted around the axle around this kind of thing and and can't figure out how to talk it out and has this going back and forth this waffling and this basically what amounts to he said she said drama um yeah that that is really kind of like looking back like that has really deeply eroded my trust in all people involved regardless of whose fault it is because it's like how did it get this far why why didn't why weren't they mature enough to talk it out why didn't they have contingency plans and as people often say on my comment section if humans can't align to each other how in the hell are we supposed to align AGI and if Sam and Ilia can't align to each other how the hell are we supposed to trust them to align AGI so that's my primary concern all right I'm going to get off my soap box I hope this makes sense to yall cheers
