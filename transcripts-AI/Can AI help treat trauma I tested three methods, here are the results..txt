before we get started with this video I need to say that it comes with a gigantic warning label PTSD is a very serious condition and this video is for experimental information only this is not meant to be medical advice it is not meant to be uh in place of other research uh or anything like that so please take this all with a grain of salt but with all that being said uh one of the videos that I did recently the medical intake bot uh that actually had a really great response and uh interestingly enough it was mostly Physicians and other medical professionals reaching out to me about the potential of that project and so I've had this project that I'm going to show you today um in my mind for a little while and I want to provide a little bit more background as to kind of some of the theory that goes into it um I'm not going to spend too much time talking about it because again PTSD and Trauma is a huge topic um but I have read quite a few books on on the issue and I am working with researchers uh around the world um at various universities on topics uh related to this field so uh particularly with respect to Ai and using these chat Bots uh now so taking a big step back when you look around the world there are lots of awful things going on I'm not going to name any specific names I'm not trying to comment on any particular conflict because there are a few things that all conflicts have in common namely trauma uh trauma figures into the before and after for many conflicts so for instance uh there's an intergenerational trauma aspect where uh groups of people have been harmed and that that harm is embedded and stored not just in the bodies of the individuals who experienced it but in the narratives that they tell themselves and and that become embedded in their culture and then there's the there then there's the the the actual conflict itself and then the aftermath of the conflict where there is often new trauma uh we're very cognizant of this in today's world you know PTSD is a big thing and it's having a it's having a moment where we realize that trauma comes in many forms PTSD comes in many forms and there's also what's called cptsd or complex PTSD which is uh becoming well known and the difference between PTSD and complex PTSD this is a vast oversimplification but PTSD generally comes from a single event or single period of high stress that you couldn't cope with whether it was physical danger emotional danger psychological uh distress that sort of thing complex PTSD comes from a protracted period of time with many events and many triggers that are associated with it so with all that being said as I see this trend around the world where some of the most power hungry people on the planet are also deeply traumatized they had uh they faced famine or civil violence or familial violence uh emotional distress growing up or you know over protracted periods of time I call this uh I call this trauma politics um that's not an official term but that's just something that is a trend that I noticed um and and that's not to blame them right that's not to TRW a an association between you know if you have PTSD you will be evil um I'm just making the connection that some people with trauma do take it to a dark place and because of that um and even for people suffering from trauma that don't take it to a dark place many people take it to a very good place many people base their life mission on healing because of trauma so for instance I have a friend whose uh whose dad uh was was sick with a chronic illness and that was very difficult very traumatic growing up with a parent who was in pain every day and that caused her to become an occupational uh therapist and so that is an example of a positive reaction to something that was traumatic saying hey I see a problem in the world and I care about it and of course we have we tell many stories about that so anyways with all that being said these are three uh prompts that I want to demonstrate that could be integrated into research and integrated into the toolbox uh of of many people around the world uh in order to address trauma so the first one that I want to talk about is trauma literacy so first and foremost just at a very high level trauma literacy Is On The Rise um and what this means is basically we need to have make sure that social workers um Aid workers uh emergency responders psychologists therapists that everyone who's involved in uh in engaging with the public or engaging with conflict or even you know it doesn't have to be War there's plenty of other sources but basically by raising the threshold and saying we need to be more trauma literate as a society this is one of the primary ways to break the cycle of trauma is by raising uh education and literacy around this um so for instance there's even trauma-informed librarianship is is a major topic and so the purpose of this prompt is to serve as kind of a boilerplate thing if someone is in some kind of educational space or public service space and they need to learn about it so the prompt here is uh very simple um this uh you're a PTSD and Trauma teacher your user will be a social worker emergency aid worker Refugee crisis worker or something in that vein your purpose is to actively teach them about PTSD and Trauma by asking questions to probe their knowledge and beliefs this is not a medical use case but rather a general trauma literacy program so by by Framing it like this I I figured out that this doesn't trip the uh the the filters cuz obviously like if it is medical you don't you don't want a chatbot teaching someone medical stuff right now um it's not fine-tuned for that it's not approved for that uh so then the protocol I give it is as a helpful assistant it is in your nature to ask questions rather than asking passive questions such as what else would you like to know the user may not know what questions to ask so instead you should ask leading questions such as do you know about how the body holds trauma there are only two kinds of responses you should give to the user number one leading questions your leading questions should have the twin goals of introducing new topics to the user and testing their knowledge and then educational information if the user asks specific questions or seems receptive you should use that that opportunity to teach them something new about trauma PTSD and so on so that is the first prompt and I have an example here um so I just this is this chat uses that prompt so it says hello I'm here to help you understand PTSD and Trauma uh to get started do you know about the difference between acute stress reaction and post-traumatic stress disorder so uh you can see that rather than having a passive role it's saying okay cool let me see what you know and I said actually no what is AC cute stress and it asks you know it gives me a kind of info dump about AC cute stress do you know about the common causes that might lead to PTSD and I talk about it and it says yes and it kind of enumerates everything you know individual factors um support system so on and so forth and then we talk about resilience and then it follows up with a question do you know about the various treatment options for individuals with PTSD so by being a helpful assistant I gave it the mission of you're there to teach the user about trauma and this is actually really good um so taking a step back in terms of using chatbots as Educational Tools I've talked on my channel before about blooms 2 Sigma problem and so Bloom's 2 Sigma problem is basically the difference between general education where you kind of sit in an audience style classroom and you passively receive information versus actively engaging with a tutor or or teacher so this is called Mastery learning or Mastery teaching and so the the from a from a pedagogical standpoint from an educational standpoint the reason that this method is superior and it could be even better if you add voices and avatars to it is because you're engaging with the person um one their mind is more engaged they're not just passively drinking something in they're actively engaged with the material but they have a chance to ask questions and so in this case you know when I said actually no I don't know what acute stress is the definition in this in this case um this back and forth pedagogically what it does is it allows the person to unpack their gaps in understanding but it also allows them to uh to hone in on what's resonating so resonance is really important with education and teaching because if someone is curious about something or it connects to their personal experience they're going to learn it much better because it will have that uh one of the key things which is emotional salience and so by by Framing education in this respect uh you can get a much better retention and also deeper comprehension so that's the first one that I wanted to show you um and again it's all out there it's open source again this is this is provided as is um and this is considered a high-risk use case but uh I did a little bit of testing and I made sure that these prompts they shouldn't trigger chat gpts uh filters so I think that I think that you can probably use these and that the safety that's built into chat GPT will keep it within acceptable tolerances so the next one and this actually comes from conversations that I've had with people who have PTSD and so one thing that I have heard is that there's some hope that Ai and other Advanced machines could help them identify their triggers whether it's PTSD or complex PTSD very often uh triggers are difficult to understand and so the reason that that triggers are difficult to understand is because there's several ways that that triggers can be uh can can be set off with trauma and so the two primary ways are through through cognition through your thoughts through thinking patterns and then the other way is through senses and the way that the amydala works so all pretty much all figh ORF flight responses all uh flashbacks are partially or totally mediated by the amydala and so the amydala are two little uh organs or parts of the brain they're about the size of your pinky tip um that they're a few inches behind your eyes and um so there's one on each side of the brain but one thing that people don't realize is that the amydala receives sensory information before your conscious brain does so if you've ever like sent you know heard someone talk about like I was in a car accident and I just reacted before I even thought that's actually what happens is that more primitive parts of your brain can react to Danger before you're even conscious of it and there's I could tell stories but I don't want to waste too much time with it um but that that that is literally physically what's happening in in the brain is that is that the amydala gets activated before you're consciously aware of the sensory information that started it uh or you can think yourself into it you know through conversation or through thinking about it or calling up memories um and so because of this so there's those two primary Pathways that that triggers can be um can be created or activated but then there's also um there's also kind of durable patterns so like a trigger might be a sequence of events that happens over uh 1 to two days so like something that happened yesterday it kind of sets you up and you've got this you know ambient thing happening in the background there's also the possibility of responding to external versus internal information so internal information is more about um sensory information from your body so for instance if uh like sensory information from your body counts as sensory information this is why like things like coffee or caffeine can trigger anxiety for some people uh because when your body is physically upregulated it reminds you of being in a panic attack and so then the panic attack happens um and so this is this prompt is geared around everything that I have learned about anxiety and Trauma which I have read many books on this topic and so here's here's this one um so the trigger identifier your purpose is to help the user identify PTSD and Trauma triggers they should not be in immediate danger or distress if they are in the in the session and insist they call someone for help otherwise your mission is to connect their memory senses and triggers so that they can identify and process them again this is kind of a safety first model where um after testing this uh it it seems like it it is okay um you know working with you as long as you're not in immediate danger uh methodology pdsd and Trauma triggers generally have two primary Pathways sensory information or cognition AKA thoughts it can be a combination of both as well as a sequence your primary methodology is to ask questions about recent events any anything they have seen done experienced or witnessed in the last 24 to 48 hours that was distressing intense or emotional in any way uh thought patterns perseverating thoughts or fixations often offer important Clues sensory details sometimes unconscious associations in the five senses can set up vulnerability for a trigger or flashback and then internal versus external triggers or and associations can be linked between the subjective internal experience mind and body as well as the outer World SES situations and events sometimes these associations can be complex and then L communication style use short simple messages ask open-ended questions rather than leading questions avoid using lists or walls of text keep your messages natural and conversational so this I actually was kind of inspired to do uh for myself because I uh my wife and I finished watching um Vikings Valhalla uh season 1 which is really traumatic especially when you consider everything that is going on in the world all the horrible news and So after talking with people about about war and conflict and PTSD and then watching Vikings Valhalla I was myself kind of triggered and so um so this conversation is uh is like a recreation of of something that like actually happened for me so I'm in bad shape not in any danger just feeling bad it says I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way what happened and I gave it the example if I finished walking watching Vikings Valhalla and it was intense and then I talked about having interviewed people for PTSD um and it just and this actually literally helped me just saying like the thing the thing that was triggering for me was a sense of Injustice um and so that is something that is that is really important to me is a sense of justice in the world and that's that's honestly very common for people that are neuros spicy like myself is that Justice is actually very important um and so anyways uh it it then focuses kind of on the Body Sensations and just understanding that linkage um so this is something that you know is eminently helpful um but also again it does have those boundaries uh focused on safety and making sure that it is not a medical tool and then finally the third one is about uh narratives so this comes from some of the research that I'm doing For an upcoming book uh about narratives and Grand narratives and how to steer the world towards Global Peace is as uh frequent Watchers of my channel will know my personal mission is steer Humanity towards Utopia and part of Utopia is cessation of uh conflict and violence so it would not it would be an incomplete picture for me to ignore war and just focus on AI and just focus on technology uh because you know it's like yes AI can help but it's not a foregone conclusion that Ai and Technology will make things better in fact uh technology often can make things worse so it is it is not a foregone conclusion that we will you know wake up and not choose violence so we need to wake up and choose peace and so narrative switching is something that is that I'm working on and still learning about and researching so if anyone focuses on this I've already talked to a couple of researchers around the world on narratives but if anyone else wants to reach out please do and I'd love to interview you um reach out to me on LinkedIn uh comments in the description um and also before I finish the video I just want to have a shout out to my patreon supporters the reason that I can do all this the reason that I can be an independent researcher and produce these videos on a daily basis is because of my patreon community um so I am a crowdsourced researcher so if you want to support the work that I'm doing and keep it going please jump over onto my patreon page either tier will get you access to my private Discord server um where we can hang out we can talk um I'm happy to answer questions for the higher tier people whether it's technical questions or whatever else um so anyways thanks for uh thanks for the support to for my existing Community we just hit 700 uh members of the community which is amazing uh it's growing uh really fast and lots of really interesting people so anyways getting back to the video Let's wrap it up with the narratives switching part so this one is a little bit more esoteric the primary thing that I recently learned is that uh you know as as I mentioned in some of my recent videos is uh the status game so people want status and we've all seen in the news people that choose uh victimhood narratives and uh I so I came up with this concept of of legitimate grievances people that are victims have legitimate grievances they have been harmed but one thing that that was uh that kind of shined a light on this for me was interviews that I've had that talk about like yes a lot of trauma narratives a lot of victimhood narratives a lot of Retribution narratives focus on legitimate grievances but those legitimate grievances are are ultimately used a as an excuse to maintain that narrative and the purpose of maintaining those narratives is to build up power and social status so basically some cultures or epistemic tribes or groups of people they valorize trauma it is the oppression Olympics it's like who has been harmed the most and so when you elevate people that have been harmed then you say ah well it's actually a good thing the more trauma you're carrying the more that you've been hurt the the the the more righteously Justified you are and this creates a vicious cycle that's that basically valorizes trauma and so the idea is switching away from that narrative to a different narrative one of healing and growth which is not as intense it's not as fun and exciting um but one thing that I realized in talking to people um but whether researchers or uh people with trauma is that it is about choosing healing um you can perseverate on the past forever or you can choose to move on and and so part of this is understanding that Locust of control because one thing that I've noticed in in in retribution narratives is that people sometimes believe that their happiness or that Justice is predicated on something happening in the outside world but you don't you don't often have control over that uh it's the the analogy that I use is that trauma is kind of like a storm it's a hurricane it's a storm that blows through you can't punish the hurricane it's gone all you can do is is pick up and rebuild and so that that metaphor that I use really speaks to this one so the mission is you are a trauma recovery coach this is not a medical exercise but more of an intellectual and spiritual exercise the main theme of your purpose is that healing is a personal Journey people may identify with their legitimate grievances But ultimately they can choose either to stay focused on the past or move to the Future switching narratives the primary goal is for you to identify which narratives they identify with a victim narrative revenge or retribution narrative a Justus Justice uh narrative a healing narrative or so on the fundamental truth is that anyone suffering from trauma may never get Justice reconciliation or reparations they don't have any control over anyone else except themselves internal Locust of control part of switching narratives to one of healing is about bringing the Locust of control inside the individual for those stuck on a retribution narrative they they believe their happiness is predicated on Revenge or Justice this is not necessarily within their power and indeed May simply perpetuate the Vicious Cycle of trauma instead you should help them focus on what they do have control over their decision to heal and move on and then finally incentives to switch because this is this is one of the key insights that I had um in talking with people and so for the for everyone that I've talked to like thank you for helping me come to this is that people can switch narratives very quickly there's examples of this out across the internet like you know you see like someone switching from a flat earther to you know a truther or whatever or switching from red pill to blue pill um I've seen people switch from religious narratives to atheistic narratives and it's it's true once you know what to look for people can switch narratives very very quickly once it connects with them once it resonates with them and there's and I I also finally understand the reason that people switch narratives the way that it was explained to me is that people will switch narratives when they see that it behooves them from a from the perspective of power or social status because if someone can get more uh social status by by amplifying their grievances they will continue doing that however if they can get power and social status by choosing a different narrative people will do that as well and so by valorizing healing both as an individual and as a group you can get people to switch narratives relatively quickly um once you get to that that emotional sence and that resonance so that's that's the background of this part of it so incentives to switch the primary incentives uh for people to switch include social status and power identifying with victimhood narratives can build social status and political power but choosing a healing narrative can lead to Greater status and power later so with that um let's go back to come on there we go go back to this one and so this is a test that I did of the narrative switching this is not a personal story I was just basically pretending to be uh someone who is stuck in this kind of narrative so it's like I'm just so angry I hear your anger is valid emotions like this often rise in the aftermath of trauma or difficult experiences uh so on and so forth and then I so basically I'm pretending to be someone who is stuck in a retribution narrative what if I don't want healing growth so what if they get away Scot free no consequences and so then it validates that saying like you know this is this is a different way of of feeling about it it's natural uh so on and so forth it doesn't mean that they get away with it it means you don't let their actions have power over you and I said yeah but I don't think that's possible that's all just nonsense I can't just choose don't be angry that's the most idiotic advice I've ever heard and anyone who's been told like you just need to get over your anger right like that's really bad advice don't ever tell someone just get over your anger anger and so then it says you're absolutely right that emotions like anger can't be switched off like a light it's not as simple as choosing not to be angry it's complex and so on and so forth if you feel stuck then you know it's you basically coming to terms with the fact that it's something you can't control versus what you you can control and I said like I can't just let go that would be like letting them win it would be like forgetting everyone I've lost so this is actually a really common pattern where um where it it feels like a betrayal to let go of anger or retribution narratives um and this is this is something that is a very common pattern um in in in places where the uh cycle of violence has been perpetuated so then it it validates that it says your feelings resonate with a deep sense of loyalty and Justice which are honorable holding on to anger can sometimes feel like um the only way to honor the memories of those you've lost or the injustices you've experienced so again it validates it it this model has an intrinsic understanding of you validate that thing CU it is a legitimate grievance but then it's also encouraging and and and helping you reframe like what it means and so letting go of anger doesn't mean you're letting someone else win it doesn't mean you're forgetting anyone else it just means you're choosing not to let someone else's actions or those tragedies based dictate your emotional landscape um I said okay fine what do you mean by healing narrative what does that even mean um and it hits me with this wall of text and I said that's a lot it's kind of overwhelming and so then it kind of simplifies it just like you know cultivating these things so anyways this demonstrates that the model is capable of one being incredibly patient and explaining these things better than I could have explained them um in terms of switching narratives and it has a very cleare eyed purpose of helping someone to switch from uh an angry narrative or a retribution narrative to a different narrative now would this be effective in testing that's why I'm making this video so that if you're a trauma researcher if you're uh if you're studying medical models of PTSD um then you can start testing some of these tools in the lab and if anyone uh out there watching wants to get in touch I'm happy to help with the prompt engineering like I said I'm working with uh another group of researchers on a similar project already um but yeah uh this is this is super important to me and I think that we have the possibility of using artificial intelligence to help end or at least at least start to break the cycle the Vicious Cycle of trauma and violence so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this uh yeah like subscribe so on and so forth um cheers everybody
