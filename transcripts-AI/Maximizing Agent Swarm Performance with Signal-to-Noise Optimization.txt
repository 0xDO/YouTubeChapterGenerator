good morning Collective let's dive right into the hierarchical autonomous agent swarm repo updates for today so uh number one thing right off the bat we have a second uh assistant so there is the hos board concierge which is the original as well as a new hos assistant which talks directly to the GP uh the GitHub API so it's a little bit faster both of these guys work really well and they work a little bit different so here's the board concierge the first one that was created um I I asked you know what are some best practices documentation it read it uh this one uses Bing um so it's a little bit more Global search oriented it works really well it's just a little bit slow but in terms of value added it is incredible because uh it's still faster than reading it manually um and it will also site all of the um all of the sources uh and give you direct links so this is a very powerful tool the link for this one is right here at right at the readme so if you're looking to get involved in the project and you want to get caught up these two these two gpts are the absolute best way and the first thing that you should do to start asking questions so the second one is the one that was just created by another member of the community called the hos assistant and as you can see this one uses the API uh and so this is really good for you ask it say like what are the discussions what are the bounties um and so in this case I said uh don't look at the issues look at the discussions it'll surface the correct discussions for you um and so this is it's a little it's substantially faster um but it's got a slightly different Focus so you can use both of these and like I said they've both been documented um on the main page uh as well as in the wiki which I'll show you closer to the end of the video so if you're wanting to dive in to the agent swarm um these are the very very uh best ways to get started so that's the first two touch points so go ahead and close those tabs I go through literally every discussion in issue and poll request um once a day in the morning so I went through it all and under the discussions under the announcements I have adopted a new format so primary directives for today uh 2023 November 12th make and use tools Define and instantiate agents and then finally swarm architecture and communication so um I have documented what I see as the top conversations and comments uh as well as a few uh poll requests and wikis so check out this I'll I'll this video will be linked here so if you're watching this video you might have already seen it or vice versa but check out these conversations um and then dive in so this is basically kind of a highlevel the three primary categories of things that we're trying to solve now there's a lot of conversation around agent to agent conversation um like direct agent conversation uh whether it's locally inside of a container or whether you use uh an external API something like uh you know Kafka or risq or you know something um I suspect that in the long run it will depend on the kind so for instance for real-time communication we can use something like amqp uh or cfco which allows for public uh uh Pub sub uh in order to have realtime chat between agents because then you have routing keys and you can you can have uh you know one to many broadcasts you can have producers and consumers um but then we'll also need something that is a little bit more static so that would that would mean maybe using to a database whether it's you know postra SQL uh or pine cone or chroma or whatever but something that is a little bit more static in terms of accumulating uh information and then refining stuff uh but you know honestly something that's kind of emerging to me is that uh a GitHub repo actually might be an an ideal uh touch point for a swarm because you can break things down into Wiki so if you decide that something needs to be documented you create a Wiki for it if there's something in an issue that you spot you create an issue if you're ready to solve a problem you submit a poll request and if you just want to talk about something discussions then there's also actions projects and some other stuff that we're not using so maybe the best touch point for a swarm is a GitHub repo at least in the early days as we discover what's what's working and what isn't so um yeah if someone wants to actually use uh the the GitHub uh API as the single source of truth that might be a better way to go um for now because it's a single API and it provides a lot of the tools that we need rather than Reinventing the wheel so um in terms of addressing these things uh this might be the way to go and of course uh one of the main pillars of getting to fully autonomous AGI is the ability to fully automate the process of of software development so if someone wants to do some experiments uh of of pointing some agents and assistants at a GitHub repo not this one this one is a human GitHub repo but if someone wants to wants to do a demonstration of um of creating a brand new repo and having the primary touch point of of interacting with it being the the agents the assistants to write Wiki pages to discuss issues to submit poll request I think that's probably going to be the best way to go right now uh so yeah that's that's that um one of the uh key things that I wanted to point out was PLL request 88 so we have um o Wiggins hay has been a very active contributor um and has submitted a really phenomenal poll request I definitely recommend you check it out um It's all under toolmaker and so this is uh some some pretty pretty impressive code and there's also some demonstrations out in the discussions um but and I think I've got the the tab pulled up here uh yeah so this is the this is like basically the MVP P or the minimum vial a minimum viable agent so the MVA um so I really appreciate the work that um that Wiggins has done and Wiggins has actually been promoted to being the second contributor the second collaborator um and so now we have two folks that have been deputized that have full uh Authority um across the entire repo to uh create destroy add merge whatever so thanks guys for jumping in um and so basically if you want jump in please jump in I deputize People based on the quality of work that they do and so the two primary signals is one the quality of work that they do um and also I guess before that is do they seem to understand the project because I'm basically deputizing people that I don't need to manage that is how a drone swarm works is you get it so I'm just going to go ahead and Empower you and I'm I'm going to enable you to do what you need to do and um I will continue orchest rating from uh behind well I guess not behind the scenes uh but you get the idea so yeah this was um this was a great contribution we're getting better at making some of the tools I also have some of the videos documented um so if you go uh let's see where where did I have the videos documented I think the best way to spot it is going to be here and going to the um going to the discussions um because there's some some of the folks have linked videos demonstrating their work in the discussions um I'm not going to uh repeat here but there's lotss of good stuff out in the out in the conversations so moving right along uh here's an example of someone who who this is really good work um in terms of uh someone created a new GPT and then had a video demonstrating it so this is this GPT is an action Creator um which is basically like uh make an action that will go um talk to the Reddit API and find the latest on autonomous AGI so let's see what that does I I recognize that I moved a little too fast yesterday so I'm going to be a little bit more patient um but you see okay cool oh it seems there's an issue interesting okay so it's it it ran into an issue and it's going to try again uh but this uh the the video demonstrating this was really impressive and this is the uh this is the the level of work that we're trying to do um and it even if it doesn't work perfectly it's fine because the idea is we're trying to build the tools that build the tools and if we can make the tools that can that can automate as much of the process as possible well then guess what it doesn't even need to be a human calling the toolmaker it can be another agent making the toolmaker so this is a really important step the action the action generator um so let's see it looks like it kind of gave up and said okay here's how you can do it this is actually really good ux because it it it it it gave it a try and then failed so um yeah but again this is this is how this is how we rapidly iterate so Move Fast Break Stuff if it's not broken we're not moving fast enough and we're not trying hard enough to break it so good work on that I'm I am not concerned that it didn't work but if you want uh check out the video so this is um this is conversation number 84 uh which was linked in the today's announcement so check this out um and then so this is where we're getting to a little bit more higher level abstract stuff so uh the three pillars of today's directives are uh number one the tool making and Tool use so we were just uh talking about that um then the minimum viable agent so instantiating and defining what a minimum viable agent is please jump into that discussion it's super useful and then finally um very much higher level stuff talking about okay well if you have one swarm how do you orchestrate that that individual swarm but then also if you have multiple swarms talking to each other how do you do that because the because the GitHub API seems like it's kind of a good One-Stop shop we might might start there um so but then that's basically like one repo talking to another but uh as I commented here let's get one swarm working first but I'm really glad to see that people are thinking about having multiple swarms uh coordinate and collaborate because then you might end up with swarms of swarms uh basically you might have one swarm that's kind of managing things and and instantiating other swarms and evolving them there's also been some conversations as I mentioned yesterday about how do you steer swarms and how do you improve them over time so this is good these are good conversations to have but we're not there yet so again uh one thing that I will that I will say is one of the primary uh one of the primary things that we've discovered as I documented it here is signal to noise ratio um so signal to noise ratio is the primary problem to solve with human swarms and it is also the primary problem to solve with agent swarms so uh you know I I will close discussions that are off topic or that are that are out of scope um I will uh remove people if they're being too disruptive we've only had one person um need to be removed from the project because they were just completely off base um but that's to be expected with a completely P public project and so by focusing on maintaining a good signal to noise ratio this is the number one principle that we have discovered both both in this project as well as in the Ace framework project is the hardest problem to solve because once you once you find ways and like general principles to squelch the noise and and and surface the signal then that's when work really gets done fast so if someone wants to work on that from a theoretical perspective or a practical perspective how do you have agents and oh so by the way I read a lot of the comments on the video yesterday on YouTube and someone basically mentioned the same thing you basically need a moderator agent uh so that's another uh possibility to work on um so one of the last things that I'll that I'll leave you with today is I've created a for a few more Wiki Pages um every member of the of the community should have access to update these Wiki pages so one thing that I want to see is thanks guys for jumping in on the issues and the poll requests and the discussions um I did have someone request to create projects um so the two collaborators can be use this if we don't need it we don't need it that's fine um but I would like to see people capturing um some of the best practices and insights on the wikis uh because these are really useful kind of like uh sources of Truth and I've I've asked a few people to start documenting what they've got on the wikis so uh the door is open please make sure that the documentation is there because it is super useful stuff and then the very last thing that I'll say is we've got the you know a road map Wiki and then um and then the assistant best practices Wiki and so then the very last thing sorry is um also if you want to get a feel for what's going on the insights tab is very very helpful because uh it'll show you who's doing what it'll show you like this is like such a great dashboard so you can look at the issues you can look at the poll requests um and then you can see like kind of what has been going on you can also look at the uh the contributors obviously like I've done the most GMO has done a lot Wiggins has done a lot and then fire mmdc um is also uh Rising quickly as as a top contributor so basically what you can do is say like okay who's done the most and then you just you know figure out what what they're saying that you know the leaders um we can look at the community tab as well this isn't quite is useful I think that I think that the pulse and the contributors are probably the best places to look but yeah so let's see Community standards uh looks like you need to add a code of contuct uh security policy and issue templates um so I'll do that uh but yeah so thanks for watching jump in um we've got a lot of momentum and uh you know early success is fast and we are rapidly coming to realize what the challenges truly are such as the Swarm orchestration and agent to agent community but um there are people doing some experiments on that so thanks for everyone for jumping in uh and uh you know what I'm just going to go for it make it so
