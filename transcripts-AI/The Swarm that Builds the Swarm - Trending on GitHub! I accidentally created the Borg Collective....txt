so I think I might have accidentally created the boorg collective and I'm not sure that it's a bad thing so for some context if you're just uh tuning in I've been working on a project called the open AI uh autonomous agent swarm or H for hierarchical autonomous agent swarm so basically with the release of open ai's agents endpoint or assistant endpoint we realized it would be really easy to spin up an arbitrary number of agents and so I created an open source project and I've been using uh daily YouTube as more or less kind of a scrum standup uh but then the comments started getting really cool uh someone said the Swarm is pleased by your videos and then someone said is that what the subscribers are being called nowadays the swarma and I said the board Collective approves and someone says thank you little cutus there's a lot more comments like this but uh yeah so hello Collective good morning uh we are hard at work so let me give you some updates in terms of what we're doing and what we've achieved but first and foremost the most important thing is I set out a bounty so the bounties are are put under issues but I set out a bounty for someone to create a new chat GPT um that specifically reads the discussions here so that you can talk with a chatbot and someone delivered so thank you team uh the collective approves so here's the hos board concierge which you can get to it right here so I put it right at the top since it's super useful and I just said like what's the latest set of tasks I can do so it gave it like literally just as like okay cool this is what we can talk about and I'll ask like um what are the latest uh PRS is it's slow but I think it'll get faster so anyways um let's see what that says after a little bit so we'll come back but point being is that it's moving fast and there's a lot going on but we have a tool that acts as an information concierge to the actual discussions okay great we'll delve into the discussions in just a second but what I want to start with is the issues so this system has worked really well where I'll just put out a bounty um and I've closed a bunch of bounties that I realized were a little too ambitious um but it's starting to really work and so the first Bounty of the day is proposed Milestones road map and general principles um so basically I started with okay what is it that we're trying to build so we're trying to build a mission-driven hierarchical autonomous agent SW it needs to be self-organizing and we're realizing that's the hardest part so I've got a few other uh bounties that are around that and then ideally in the long run as a stretch Co it should be self-improving which there's been a lot of conversation around that but we need milestones in a road map so we need to we need to get more organized around the general principles that we're discovering so on and so forth and and to do that I created a Wiki and I actually allowed for like this is Wikipedia style um anyone can can create an edit but I have a general principle um wait it looks like it didn't save the okay I'll update this I had I had a homepage that said uh that we need to um we need to uh abide by some general principles so I'll fix that but anyways I've documented the chat GPT agents so there's the the hos board concierge and then there's the first one that I built um then oh here's the homepage this is supposed to be the homepage um general rules and principles don't modify this page less is more and document hygiene um and then finally I put a a placeholder for the road map so uh that's uh how we're going to order organized so this is going to be this is very similar to like the standard operating procedures that we should attach to all agents so basically all agents in the autonomous swarm should have a standard set of documents that they that they can follow and abide by so that is how you can ensure that the behavior of all the agents is at least somewhat aligned and so that they have some relative information so we are the agent swarm and we are building the agent swarm great it's swarm Inception agent Inception so so that's the first Bounty um another Bounty is I'd like for the community to look at the recent PLL requests and the current codebase and the open poll requests and comment on them um so there's a few things that uh that I I was not quite so happy about with the current ones I want to so let me just say I want to integrate all this code um but we need to make sure that we're adhering by uh best practices and keeping the the repo organized um so that's first and foremost I did merge the poll requests that that are that are good so just test the code base let's make sure that it's working um and share your results uh that's what the discussions tab is for people are using that uh to great effect um and then let's see the next big thing is we realized that the uh that the agent uh communication is actually the hardest part and I also had a meeting with the ace framework team which I'll talk about in just a second uh but basically like we can take inspiration from from chat Dev and autogen but we really need to to establish like the best practices and general principles for establishing agent to agent communication and also one thing to keep in mind is that we are going to need to have multiple layers of communication which actually let me just go ahead and show you that in the wiki um so in the road map I had I had you know my ideas like based on based on some of the discussions so I'm reading all the discussions by the way um what's kind of emerging is that it looks like we need kind of a global communication space for all agents to talk like on broadcast so that'll be like an internal Twitter um which you know honestly pine cone would be good for that because then like all agents can search everything that is put on the global space and it's super fast and it's got metadata so that's basically an internal Twitter um and it's a it's a third party API which also means that it's arbitrarily accessible um but uh people are also talking about we need to document topics and it needs to be organ organized so I think an internal Reddit kind of style thing would be really good for basically you know accumulating knowledge around specific topics but again that can be a thirdparty API so knowledge accumulation topic management and that sort of thing but you know let's use the Reddit and then we also need a real time uh set of chat channels such as Discord which could also be an external third party kind of thing um but yeah so I think these three like styles of communication should all be used eventually um but obviously we're very early so hence this um hence this uh Bounty which is um talking about multi-agent like we need to start with the basics CU we as humans know how to use Twitter Reddit and Discord but now we need to make we need to make sure that we can build agents that can use those communication platforms as well um and I think between the three of those there's enough differences like structural differences in terms of strengths and weaknesses that um that could probably hopefully solve uh swarm self organization cuz that's going to be a that's a tough nut to crack um and then finally I have one final um PR just to organize the repo that's the those are the issues of the day uh I'm not going to go over the poll request um you can check these out they're up there but what I will say is check the closed issues and check the closed poll requests as well just so you can see what has been changed this is going to be one of the easiest ways to get up to speed because ultimately the discussions are there as part of the conversation but the ultimate source of Truth is going to be the issues the PLL requests and the wiki um the discussions are there for kind of getting the community to churn um I did update some of the Pinn conversations so check these out I've got a um I've got a welcome message we have our first uh contributor this is a member from the ace framework team so um he's a set as a collaborator so welcome guo he's been uh really really heads down on this and just super involved um and has had some really good ideas is um so I've got some help now um let's see I guess uh the last thing is like let's go over some of the top discussions um so this one is what I showed yesterday there's been a lot of discussions on uh the agent relation and communication architecture so this is this is really good there's been there's been a lot more conversation um and actually that conversation was what kind of inspired me to say looks like we need a Twitter a Reddit and a Discord um let's see this thread was really cool so we're getting to the point where the tools are generalizing and we're getting where it can it can set up its own tool chains is the very short version so if if we have agents that can build tools like build arbitrary tools and then chain them together like this is what I mean by creating a swarm that can build whatever it needs um so self-improvement at a certain level looks like it's eminently possible so Che definitely check out this thread I yes I pinned it I pinned it it uh so that it'll be easier to find tool Builder interacting with the real world incredible Behavior definitely check this out this is going to be a critical insight and this this post also serves as a really great example as to how you can contribute back to the community even if all you do is an experiment on your own by by going off on your own either in your own repo or your own fork or just locally and then and then sharing what you've done share the code too like a link to your code or or a GitHub gist um that will help integrate and the uh the collectives intelligence our collective intelligence will go up um in order uh and if you do these kinds of things yeah and there's lots of good conversation around this um I think those are the two biggest things today so if you want to stop watching now that's fine but um let's see there was a couple other things I think actually maybe that was it um there's been a lot of other other good conversations and questions so for instance does you know agent generator need to be H top of the hierarchy that was good oh this was another one this was uh will will multi-agent communication become the new prompt engineering and so basically this is by reading all these conversations I realize that okay here's the kinds of communication channels we need anyways um thanks for jumping in everyone uh locutus has spoken go forth and assimilate all useful technological uh distinctiveness um yeah have a good one
