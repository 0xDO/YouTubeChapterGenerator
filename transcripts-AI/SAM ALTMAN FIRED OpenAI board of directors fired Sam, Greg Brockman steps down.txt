okay so I just saw the bombshell news that Sam Alman was fired as CEO of open aai now there are two facts of this because I read the whole Announcement by open AI there are two facts that are very interesting so the first is that a uh successor CEO has not been found or appointed instead they're they're appointing an interim CEO now this isn't entirely uncommon when a board desires decides to fire a CEO but usually you decide to fire a CEO because there is a usually a pretty Grievous misalignment um of values or needs so in some cases I've heard stories of CEOs being fired for drug abuse and addiction I don't think that's the case here um but it does sound like the board decided that they needed to act quickly uh because they were likely concerned again this is pure speculation on my part but they were concerned about the direction that that Sam Alman was going and what they said in the in in the uh statement was that Sam Alman had not quote been completely candid with the board which made it difficult for them to do their job truthfully or honestly or something like that um which is like who that's pretty strong language they they that's a very diplomatic way of saying Sam mman lied to them uh which is fascinating turn of phrase the other fact of this is that they um is that Greg Brockman is also stepping down uh as chairman of the board which when you look at this as a set of chess moves you get rid of the king um or you know some some Power Player and then another player loses their power I wonder if there was an alliance between Sam and Greg and with Sam gone um there was no more leverage to keep Greg on the um on the board something like that again pure speculation on my part um but very interesting development nonetheless so I'm very curious to see how this will play out let me know in the comments um this is obviously developing quickly I think it was announced literally just 30 minutes ago so very fascinating way to end a week uh especially with everything that's been going on with open AI developer day and Microsoft's ignite and everything else going on so yeah uh have a good weekend everybody and stay tuned
