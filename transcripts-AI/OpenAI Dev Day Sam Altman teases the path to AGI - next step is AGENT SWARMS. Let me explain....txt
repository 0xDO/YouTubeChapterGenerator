okay so I just finished watching the uh open AI developer day and uh or at least the keynote speech and I'm not going to comment on a lot of the specifics um but there's a couple things that I will comment on so first and foremost they're baking in a lot of uh memory and other tool use and other things into the agent so the the core model the GPT model is getting all kinds of additional things kind of bolted on uh part in terms of the capabilities of the language model but also in the wrapper around it and so this is an analogy that I've said for a long time that creating AGI is not just creating the engine cu the GPT model by itself is like the engine of a car you need the rest of the car in order to get AGI so that's what we're seeing happening in real time they're adding more and more tools and more structure around the core model and so one of the first things that they're adding is better memory the ability to instantiate agents uh on the Fly and more tools and so these are the kinds of things that people like I and others who are working on cognitive architectures have been doing for quite a while where it's you need memory systems you need communication systems and all this other fun stuff so for instance the Json feature that they're adding is going to allow you to ensure that the communication from one model to another API is always going to be in the correct Json format without having to do any extra steps which is really nice really handy uh now one thing that I was person listening for is autonomy and so he Sam Alman did say like we're making it easier to create more agents and the agents are going to be more capable and soon the agents are going to be able to to do more planning and make more decisions on their own without your input so he basically alluded to autonomy without saying the word autonomy because that would spook a lot of people uh but then at the very end of the keynote speech he said that you know he basically told us the road map the road map that open AI wants to create is they're getting the world ready for more agents to get used to the idea of having human directed agents and I don't remember who I was talking to I think it was a patreon supporter but they said that uh or maybe it was someone from the ace framework team but they said that like it makes sense to go this way because nobody knows how to even use agents yet let alone deploy fully autonomous agents and I realized that uh and hindsight I had a client ask me once hey you know you're doing all this work on cognitive architecture let's deploy autonomous agents and I said are you using generative AI at all yet in your company and they said no I said you're not ready to deploy fully autonomous agents and I was like and also you're not going to be able to find anyone who knows how to deploy them because this is a brand new discipline we are still actively researching how to create autonomous agents so I've got a video coming out in a week or two uh talking about one of the ways to steer these things um so I think you'll be really excited about that I had conversations with a couple philosophers and a couple people from the ace framework team about this new paradigm that's coming uh so I'm really excited to announce that but I I have a lot of work to do um in terms of testing it but the initial test looked really good so stay tuned for that um but yeah so I have been critical of open Ai and Sam Alman what they say is often agreeable but then what they do and their incentives often leave me with some questions uh so time will tell uh but one other thing that I wanted to point out uh from a business perspective is I have had many many people ask me like how do we overcome the limitation of the model today and I said just wait literally just wait 6 months because having started back in the age of gpt3 you know where we had gpt3 for just like a year and a half before we had any movement so but you know the the window the token window size started at 1,000 went up to 2,000 went up to 4,000 that was a year ago a year ago today we still had only 4,000 tokens now we have 128,000 tokens uh that's what exponential growth looks like but also beyond that so here's an example I had a prospective client say Dave I really want your help overcoming the token window limits and I said no that's a waste of time I said you're going to you're going to waste days weeks or even months trying to overcome the limitations of the model today and um then all the work that you're going to do is going to be completely invalidated by the next iteration that comes out and what everyone just saw in real time is what I have seen over the last four years um and so like basically the rule of thumb that I recommend to everyone is if you find a limit for the model that is just a limit for the model it might not be smart enough to overcome what you're trying to do the the window count might not be big enough or whatever so once you find these new limits the limit is the limit um but yeah so this is a huge step towards AGI and towards autonomy I've had a lot of people message me on LinkedIn and other places like so have you updated your your estimate for AGI yet and I'm like it it's all confirmed I honestly think that my my estimate for AGI which is SE right now at September 2024 uh I think is probably too conservative um because basically what Sam Alman just said is hey we want to get the world ready for semi-autonomous agents and the next stage is guess what but human level autonomous agents that can make decisions and and I mean they're already superhuman in a lot of ways like you know you hop on over to claw or whatever they can read an entire book in 30 seconds um and then can produce useful output on that as we get better at making these agents that can do planning and execution and testing and iteration and Cycles it's basically game over right so a lot of you in my audience seem to uh believe and agree that like we're heading towards post laor economics or or you know some kind of job apocalypse where most jobs are going away I I've had a lot of conversations with people where it's like you know we can we can squint really hard and try and imagine that you know yeah jobs are going to stay and but again it's normal C bias I've talked about this before but then like when you take a big step back and look at it in terms of first principles this is the this is the four criteria I talk about better faster cheaper safer when Ai and machines and robots Are Better Faster cheaper and safer than a human a given job the human job goes away forever now will that create enough abundance to to say like oh well now that the machine can do the same thing as a human for a hundred times less uh you know cost is that going to is that going to create an abundance of wealth and demand elsewhere I don't know that it is not it's certainly not for jobs as we know them today um but neither here nor there because then what I was talking about with other people is you look at it in terms of demand side so the way to think about this is what jobs will there be where you are willing to pay a premium in order to have a human in that job and the quintessential example is a Somalia so if you don't know what a Somalia is this is someone who is an expert on all wines around all the world and they they work at fancy restaurants and they help you pair uh wine they help you pick a wine to go with your meal um I've actually been to a restaurant just once as an adult that was fancy enough to have a Somalia and that is the kind of thing that like yeah hypothetically a robot could do um but you know that they don't have a sense of taste and they certainly don't have a subjective experience of of wine that you do um do we need a billion Somali no right and that's the kind of thing is like is there going to be enough demand for those premium jobs to justify replacing all humans now reading between the lines Sam Alman has said many many times in the past like we're going to revolutionize things and and I think he and others have been quoted as saying like you're going to have a lot more free time what does he mean like what does he mean when he says you're going to have a lot more free time that means you're not going to have a job right so anyways I'm probably preaching to the choir here but I wanted to get my thoughts out as soon as I finished watching this thing because you know you guys know me like AGI full autonomy post- labor economics this is the kind of thing that I'm looking for and that I'm waiting for and so I'm looking for the clues I'm reading the tea leaves you know um and and I would say the the biggest things that I saw just a quick recap before I close out this video the biggest things that I saw that are Clues to that is one they're going to they're going to work on instantiating agents as fast as you possibly can and each of those agents is going to come baked in with their own memory which is a really critical component uh you know in terms of knowledge storage and then tool use so you combine you know the the customizable nature of it you can spin them up they have data that they can refer to they have tools TOs and apis that they can call you're a long ways there because think of it this way build a robot or a peripheral that has an API call you know use zapier to automate your home or whatever or you know build a robot Butler right like once you get to the API level where these these agents can direct themselves or direct other agents cuz this is this is kind of where I'm going with this in terms of how to create autonomy is you actually rather than creating a single autonomous en you create dozens hundreds thousands of Agents each with different personas or archetypes and so then those they all debate amongst themselves as we saw with chat Dev so chat Dev if you're not familiar is a project where they basically created a software company with you know a a few dozen agents and each agent had a different personality what if you give them the personalities of Captain peard what if you give them the personalities of you know King Solomon and you give you have a whole bunch of agents that have these different personalities and those are the ones that are making moral ethical and Mission oriented decisions in terms of what other agents to spin up so then you we're very very close to having agents that create more agents and and set missions and supervise and have different roles um and so I think I think the model of autonomy of AGI that we're going to be uh moving towards very close is more like the GU from Mass Effect where each individual agent is actually relatively small and so like uh Legion the GU that you get in Mass Effect he actually has aund I think he said that he has more than a thousand agents running in the hardware platform so I think uh I think Mass Effect wins for being the most accurate way that uh that AGI is going to be achieved um because it's so much easier to just spin up a really small individualized agent that has its own little Mission its own little set of tools and its own little memory and so then it does one little thing and then it can you know you know you can have ephemeral agents you can have permanent agents as well but I think instantiating and de-provisioning agents um is probably going to be the way that we achieve AGI and then you know you'll have one aggregate interface you know like Alexa or whatever um that will be kind of the your your input but it's going to be uh many many many nodes uh in the future and and when I say many I mean like your average Enterprise is probably going to have a million agents this time next year uh instantiated and and destroyed um on a daily basis and so then you're talking about billions if not hundreds of billions of Agents being created and destroyed on a daily basis globally this time next year um and but then who's creating the agents right you have one human who acts like an orchestrator who says okay I need software that does this and then the system spins up a thousand agents to figure out what it is that you need to go test it and then those thousand agents spin up another thousand agents each as they supervise all the things and then once the software that you've requested or whatever it doesn't even have to be software this time next year we could all have robots maybe um and then you know the problem is solved all the agents get deprovisioned some of the logs get stored in some master repository so that the you know the whole system can learn from it that's really where I predict that we're going and um what many of you don't necessarily know is that uh this was what I did I I was a it infrastructure so setting up containers creating automated pipelines it's the same technology just you add the GPT engine into it and now you've got a bunch of new capabilities so anyways uh real quick plug for my patreon we do have a private Discord server which um not everyone is into we also have new exclusive content so uh both tiers have exclusive content that's given to them as well as channel members here on YouTube so uh yeah if you want to jump on in support me get in on the community if you're not into the community side at least I've got some exclusive content where you get raw unfiltered and deep dives into various topics that I'm talking about uh and yeah I've also got two books that are coming out uh my novel is pretty much done um I just need a proofread pass basically um and then I'm going to get that uh going so either sign up on the free tier on patreon or my substack in order to uh links in the description in order to get notified when that's ready for pre-order and then my systems thinking book so uh about me I you know successful it career what you might not know about me is I have a grand total of 5 weeks of college under my belt and two certifications um but I was able to build a six-figure career and then I was able to become an expert in Ai and then I was able to become a a famous YouTuber right so how did I do all of these things how did I find success in everything that I did I took a big step back and realized that it was systems thinking so now I've got a systems thinking book coming out um and I'll probably do some systems thinking courses inside my patreon so if you're subscriber you'll get some uh some unique training videos uh related to systems thinking um but yeah thanks for watching I hope that you are as excited as I am about these developments and um yeah so stay tuned I think we're in for a very exciting 2024 cheers
