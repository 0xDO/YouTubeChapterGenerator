0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:47:21.360,0:47:25.440
the embedding will be to what you're looking
for and you see how these scores go way up
0:47:26.640,0:47:32.700
um and so it's the the whole idea is if you find
one abstract that you like or if you can think of
0:47:32.700,0:47:37.080
kind of the title of what you're looking for you
just kind of keep typing and you give it as much
0:47:37.080,0:47:42.120
as you can and it will generate a more accurate
embedding and so then I've got it where it just
0:47:42.120,0:47:47.880
you know here's the title here's the score and
then here's a link directly to the archive so
0:47:47.880,0:47:52.260
it'll just take you straight to it I suppose
I could have had a little bit more metadata in
0:47:52.260,0:47:57.600
here like the date and authors and stuff but I
didn't include that like because I was like why
0:47:57.600,0:48:02.940
duplicate effort like I just got the bare minimum
that was required which is the title abstract and
0:48:02.940,0:48:06.780
ID which allows you to come straight here and
then you can say okay this is when that was
0:48:08.100,0:48:17.580
um but yeah so then like I did uh what was it like
uh Large Hadron Collider is that one where LR2
0:48:18.840,0:48:23.160
um Higgs vacuum Decay from particle
collisions and so it's just like okay
0:48:23.160,0:48:31.140
cool everything related to colliders and etc
etc um bigger better faster more at the LHC
0:48:32.040,0:48:40.200
um and you see the the semantic similarity score
of 0.54 um and yeah so I think probably the next
0:48:40.200,0:48:45.480
thing that I'll do is I might add a tab or
another function where it's like okay you
0:48:45.480,0:48:51.540
know if you have the results that you want like
generate a literature review but you see how
0:48:51.540,0:48:56.340
fast this is and and the quality of the results
and this is using a very low dimensional Vector
0:48:57.300,0:49:03.300
um relatively speaking because 512 is pretty small
you can go up to 12 000 with DaVinci that would
0:49:03.300,0:49:10.500
be really expensive to embed 2.1 million things
with da Vinci but anyway so let's just grab this
0:49:11.880,0:49:15.180
um and so we'll do here actually let's
0:49:16.500,0:49:25.140
copy the both the title and the embedding
and then we'll just put this in our search
