how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:29:22.200,0:29:26.520
I wonder if there's a way I can speed this
up anyways you don't need to watch all that
0:29:27.180,0:29:31.260
um if I'll if I find a way to speed
it up I will come back and show you
0:29:35.160,0:29:42.960
okay so um yeah it wasn't going fast enough for
me so this should work um but yeah so what I was
0:29:42.960,0:29:50.280
working on was I made the prop well all right
so a few things first loading 2.1 million or
0:29:50.280,0:29:56.880
2.3 however many millions of chunks are things and
processing them one at a time is slow especially
0:29:56.880,0:30:02.940
when your model can do batching so I'm creating
batches of a thousand and we're feeding it in
0:30:02.940,0:30:07.920
in chunks and then we're processing each chunk
as a batch and you can look at the code if you
0:30:07.920,0:30:13.800
want but it's it's pretty straightforward but
the the the the secret sauce is here is where
0:30:14.700,0:30:22.140
um you do the 100 or a thousand in batches and
it should go a little bit faster so instead of
0:30:23.700,0:30:25.680
um uh let's see what just happened
0:30:28.320,0:30:35.760
oh I ran out of memory okay so I can't do
batches of a thousand um yeah that's not working
0:30:37.080,0:30:41.400
okay so that's too big so let's go
back down to 100 because that did work
0:30:42.360,0:30:47.580
um so we'll do uh that of a thousand so there's
no embeddings and this is filling up the error
0:30:47.580,0:30:53.280
directory yes okay so delete that okay so we'll
do a batch of a hundred so rather than doing one
0:30:53.280,0:30:59.940
embedding at a time we'll do a hundred at a
time um yeah and we'll go from there uh okay
0:31:00.600,0:31:05.880
so clear that out so generate embeddings so
the reason that I'm doing this is because
0:31:06.900,0:31:09.960
um I was doing it one at a time and I was
like okay you know I've got a small GPU
0:31:10.500,0:31:14.700
um but it was like 36 hours that it was going
to take and I'm like I'm not going to let this
0:31:14.700,0:31:19.200
thing run for 36 hours straight I can do better
than that I'm gonna challenge myself to do better
0:31:19.800,0:31:25.440
so I'm gonna see make sure that this works and
make sure that it's filling up my um not errors
