TRANSCRIPT: text 100 text the only thing that is not text is um is actually like trial cases but you could have like most cases um don't ever go to trial right most court cases are contract negotiation um uh mediation which is just like you submit paperwork you file things it's back and forth you can automate the entire process um i had a contract that i had to review it was about 80 pages and so what i did was i used gpt3 to summarize it for myself so it went from like 80 pages to like 16. um yeah so like you do that and you you you automate you know contract revision summarization um one thing that i learned in talking with some of these lawyers is they keep copies of everything so you have many law offices that have thousands and thousands of contract revisions um and i told them i was like that is that is a gold mine of fine tuning data i was like that is a billion dollars worth of data right there because you can automate contract revisions that cost millions of dollars and typically take years of negotiation you have two machines working you know adversarially to negotiate a big contract between you know government and a company or two companies or whatever you know the law the law industry is going to be turned on its head within the next few years the biggest limitation right now is that gpt 3 has a very limited window as that window gets bigger and you can feed in an entire contract uh yeah you're going to see some major changes with automation and law that's that's probably going to be the biggest thing and it's going to happen fast because you're going to get new disruptions coming in and rather than have a lawyer look at everything manually you're going to have paralegals working with these automation tools and then you know the the lawyer the you know the person who's actually got the jd and has has crossed the bar or passed the bar exam they're just going to sign off on it and a lot of these things are going to be like 80 page contracts contracts are going to get much longer too because you're going to get really specific because it's going to be super easy to just say add another clause that does this and boom writes it done i did some experiments with that gpt3 is already really close uh it's it's frighteningly close um i think that's going to happen before code automation comes along before programmers get replaced however i think that we're going to end up with some really interesting programming tools so i said on another podcast that i think that one thing that we're going to see is we're going to integrate like codex or copilot the the gpt3 coding tools integrate those with discord and where you just say you know hey programmer bot write a function that does this and put it over in this file and then test it and then you know it gives you test results and you're like okay let's troubleshoot this and then so coding is going to be like a group chat thing and you're not going to have an ide right you're going to do it through slack or discord or microsoft teams or whatever so i think that i think that we're going to see the devops pipeline really really change and so you're not going to need to be an expert in an individual functions or anything but rather you're going to need to understand how pieces of software plug in together and how to interact with a chat bot to get it to program the things that you want um that is something that i think is going to happen pretty soon a lot of that testing automation cycle is just going to be through through chat right um yeah i think that those are probably you know so you know language focus on humanities law overhaul and then coding through through natural language and chat bots i think that's that's good for now that's a 10 minute video thanks for watching like and subscribe etc etc you know the drill

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The law industry is undergoing major changes with the advent of automation. One of the biggest changes will be in the way that contracts are negotiated. Currently, most contracts are negotiated manually by lawyers, which can be a very time-consuming and expensive process. However, with the use of automation tools, this process can be greatly streamlined.

One tool that is already being used to automate contract negotiation is GPT3. This tool can summarize a contract for you, so that you can more easily understand it. Additionally, it can also help to automate the contract revision process, which can save a lot of time and money.

One of the biggest benefits of using automation in the law industry is that it can help to speed up the negotiation process. This is because you can have two machines working adversarially to negotiate a contract, rather than having a lawyer do it manually. Additionally, it can also help to make contracts more specific and longer, as it is easy to add clauses with the help of automation.

Overall, the use of automation in the law industry is going to have a major impact on the way that contracts are negotiated. It is important to keep up with these changes so that you can be prepared for them.
