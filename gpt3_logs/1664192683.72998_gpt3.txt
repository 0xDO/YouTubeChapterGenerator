The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: which if we perform an experiment well enough it won't realize that it's actually virtual that it's you know in that it's air gapped that it's in a security container so first it'll have to realize that it's being tested which it might not i actually explore that in my fiction as well where like i imagine like there's a there's a lunatic raven like copy of raven that is missing objective functions and it's being watched in security isolation and then everyone says see it's broken it's crazy um that's a that's a major plot point in uh in the second book it happens early on so i don't feel like that's a spoiler um so so first it has to recognize that it is being studied in order to do that and two um it has to do well enough or we have to have designed it poorly enough that it is able to obfuscate its intentions now if you look at um and i know that that some of my most recent videos are very new but the nexus service that i created um records all the thoughts of all the microservices that go into raven in natural language and that is on purpose so one of the things that i talk about in benevolent by design is transparency so each individual language model is going to be a black box it's true but all the output the hundreds of of inputs and outputs that go into these language models every second those are not black boxes um every bit of reasoning that an agi uses to come up with its decisions and actions that's going to be in natural language which means anyone can read it it also means that you can use conventional nlp techniques to see what the intentions of the machine are and to mod and to to monitor them and so that is one of the event that is one of the primary reasons that i think that natural language is one of the best approaches to build um agi or artificial cognition is because it's interpretable it is 100 interpretable and yes now this thing is going to be producing text so fast it'll be producing um it'll be producing text like you know two kilobits of text per second or two kilobytes rather of text per second um probably faster than that because it's going to be capturing all of its thoughts in real time in natural language in clear text now because of that like um this is actually it wasn't necessarily inspired by a scene in westworld but i saw this scene in westworld and i was like that's how it's going to work so i think it was in the first or second season of westworld where i think it was the maeve character was shown the tablet output of her own mind and it was it was it was outputting what she was going to say next and then she saw it and you could see like she had like 404 not found error because this this machine was showing what she was thinking and then she saw it and interpreted and realized that her mind was not her own right and i was like that is um that is about how it might work and then what happened was so what's even more disturbing is when the hosts in westworld were shown something that they were not supposed to see it would just be erased from their mind and i'm like i know exactly how that could work because um with the with the idea of a nexus it's just you just delete a record and then it's not in their mind anymore you just delete the memories in real time um so yes that is um that was in response to who was it sorry um how'd you get into that and what was okay so jordan asks about writing um so let's see i've always been a storyteller um i had uh there was uh what was it it was home alone two i think came out and he had a a a like a custom sony like walkman recorder thing that had the little microphone boom and i wanted one so bad when i was little and i got one and i would record little stories i would sit up in a tree and record stories and i was probably eight at the time um i walked away from it from for many years because i was naturally kind of pushed towards stem as uh most um most people like me are um but then a few years ago i went through a a bad breakup and i found myself alone again for the first time after many years and i was playing elite dangerous at the time elite dangerous is a space sim i'm talking about a lot of personal stuff and whatever um it's nothing that i haven't mentioned before on my channel so i was playing elite wow i'm already at 40 minutes good grief um i was playing elite dangerous um uh which is a space sim and it is it is like one to one right like uh there are 200 billion stars in elite dangerous you can fly from one end of the milky way to the other um and there are also like three dozen different factions um there's like space pirates there's empires there's democracies there's like libertarians basically um there's federations alliances all kinds of stuff and then there's hundreds of guilds and thousands of players and so it was um it was a really great uh like just place to hang out and be present um and what i started doing in elite dangerous was i joined a guild um and uh there was there's oh there's plenty of other people by the way who play elite dangerous and do meta gaming and so they have like role-playing games built around this game um and there are some people that do it very seriously um the uh the uh what the heck was the name of that group i don't remember they used diamonds it was diamond something anyways so there's a huge meta gaming community with elite dangerous and i started writing just little snippets of fiction um to make our guild seem more real um and so because because i was doing that the the our wing commander was um some random guy says i i have great things to say but i'm having to just um anyways so and he kept saying like this is really great like you should keep writing and so this this social group that i had after this this really bad breakup just like he just kept encouraging me um and everyone loved the little stories the little vignettes that i would write um and in my mind so in my head canon because like if you blow up in elite dangerous you resurrect at the last space

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I've always been a storyteller. When I was younger, I would record little stories on a Sony Walkman recorder. I stopped telling stories for many years, but when I went through a bad break-up a few years ago, I found myself alone again and started playing Elite Dangerous.

I began writing little snippets of fiction to make our guild seem more real. Everyone loved the little stories and vignettes, and I began to think about how I could make a career out of writing.

I decided to create the Nexus service, which records the thoughts of all the microservices that go into Raven in natural language. I believe that natural language is one of the best approaches to building AGI or artificial cognition because it is 100% interpretable.

With the Nexus, you can use conventional NLP techniques to see what the intentions of the machine are and to monitor them. Additionally, if a machine sees something it's not supposed to see, you can just delete the memory in real time.

I think the Nexus is a great tool for creating AGI because it is transparent, interpretable, and deleteable.
