The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: sense of discipline right if you are a disciplined person you will one you'll make good decisions but two you'll be able to stay on task and you'll be able to task switch um appropriately um and so there are things some components of cognitive control such as keeping track of topics changing priorities um self-awareness and metacognition also figure into it and also if you notice that it shifts from left to right it's because this pdf is for printing um anyways just notice like you might notice that the alignment changes and that's because this is this is the actual printed copy um yeah and so then also for cognitive control you need to be aware of like your identity you need to be um you need to be conscious of your beliefs and what evidence you're operating on so there's a lot that goes into cognitive control and then part five learning so this is actually the shortest section because and there's a reason that it's at the end is because this is where the most work still needs to be done but i still have a few principles to start with which is first record everything um and then two label your memories to create uh curated automatically curated data sets and then what that goes towards is self-correction and error detection so you know machine learning that's pretty well established no you you ingest data you know especially if you have a robot with cameras and eyes having data is not going to be the problem labeling that data and curating data sets to train new models that's the problem but more importantly if you have an autonomous autonomous machine it's going to need to self-correct and detect errors both in itself and outside of itself and so yeah that is uh that is an overview of the book um the reason i'm just i'm gonna i'm going ahead and releasing it as um electronically is because looking at the numbers most people just download it electronically all of my other books i've only sold a handful of like physical copies the paperback will be available soon but like 99 of people just read it digitally so there you go it's out there um symphony of thought uh on my github um you can probably just search for it um but yeah symphony of thought orchestrating artificial cognition out now um stay tuned for the paperback thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The book "Symphony of Thought: Orchestrating Artificial Cognition" is now available. In it, author David Shapiro covers the five key components of artificial cognition: memory, attention, decision-making, learning, and cognitive control.

Memory is important for storing information and knowledge. Attention is necessary for focusing on relevant information and ignoring distractions. Decision-making is the process of choosing between different options. Learning is how new information is acquired and stored. And cognitive control is the ability to self-monitor and regulate one's thoughts and actions.

Shapiro provides principles for each of these components that can be used to build artificial cognition systems. For example, he recommends recording everything and labeling memories to create curated data sets for learning. He also emphasizes the importance of self-correction and error detection in autonomous systems.

The book is available electronically now, and the paperback will be available soon.
