TRANSCRIPT: cognition great book and then the forgetting machine so the primary theme of this book is just how little information your brain actually integrates the bandwidth between different sections of our brain is very very low and we're talking about like measured in kilobits a second not megabits or gigabits and so it's like okay well if you're only talking about kilobits a second is is our brain's bandwidth for like sensory input and and thought and output how do we get so much done right if if if our memories are very sparse right so to use um computer science terms our memories are sparse representations in that like if you were to represent it as a matrix it's mostly zeros with just a few values here and there it's like okay well how do we get so much done if our memories and thoughts and sense and sensations are all sparse um really good book this has also kind of reinforced my idea that actually we can represent all thought with natural language that's a perfectly good medium to represent what's going on in the head we don't need anything abstract like vectors although you can but the interpretability of using natural language is there um and then finally fandoms in the brain this was the my very first like neuroscience book um i read it or i saw i saw the documentary way back like 20 years ago um but yeah great book um both both of ramachandran's books that i've got here phantoms in the brain and um and the telltale brain both are look at it through the lens of neurology and neuroscience so you learn a lot about the brain when it breaks okay

um so in order to create a full-scale brain or artificial cognition we're probably going to need multiple loops and multiple concentration points now if each if each concentration point is as simple as a folder of you know text files that's not that complicated and if each of these loops is only as complicated as a wild true statement and then a nested for loop that's not that complicated either

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The primary theme of this book is just how little information your brain actually integrates. The bandwidth between different sections of our brain is very, very low and we're talking about like measured in kilobits a second, not megabits or gigabits. So it's like, okay, well, if you're only talking about kilobits a second, is is our brain's bandwidth for like sensory input and and thought and output? How do we get so much done right if if if our memories are very sparse?

Right. So, to use computer science terms, our memories are sparse representations in that like if you were to represent it as a matrix, it's mostly zeros with just a few values here and there. It's like, okay, well, how do we get so much done if our memories and thoughts and sense and sensations are all sparse?

Um, really good book. This has also kind of reinforced my idea that actually we can represent all thought with natural language. That's a perfectly good medium to represent what's going on in the head. We don't need anything abstract like vectors, although you can, but the interpretability of using natural language is there.

Um, and then finally, fandoms in the brain. This was the my very first like neuroscience book. I read it or I saw I saw the documentary way back like 20 years ago. Um, but yeah, great book. Um, both both of ramachandran's books that I've got here, phantoms in the brain and um and the telltale brain, both are look at it through the lens of neurology and neuroscience. So you learn a lot about the brain when it breaks.

Okay, all that said, let's go over some architectures make sure we get this out of the way so you can there we go. Okay, you can still see me, but you can see the screen. Okay, so this is the most basic architecture where we've got the nexus which in this case the simplest implementation is literally just a folder of text files. It's a list of inputs, outputs, thoughts, sensations, etc.

Um, and then the inner loop which in um in this one, so basically what I was trying to do here is create a home home device that I could talk to. The inner loop is literally just um one python loop. Um, let's see which one was it? I think it was this guy. Um, well true, yeah. So basically here's the loop for for d and dossier list which the dossier list is just a list of prompts. Um, do this. Uh, so yeah, that's it. Run the prompt. Load some load some uh well first I guess stack some memories. Load the prompt and then do it again. So while true, so here's one loop and then here's the nested loop. Um, yeah, that's what I mean by inner loop. You're looking at it right here. So we're going to recreate this, but we're going to change it a little bit because of some of the insights that I had.

Okay, so this is the most basic model. The outer loop, I'm not as interested in robotics. I used to think that I was if you want to know how the outer loop would look, go look up Google's flamingo. Um, let's see, Google flamingo robot. I think there's a good youtube video. Yeah, researchers have developed a technique that enabled. Yep. So basically um flamingo integrates large language models with robotics. So I'm not going to be working on that this they got this handled right. This is the outer loop where it's just how do you integrate natural language, large language models or nlp and robotics. That is what the outer loop is. I'm not as concerned about that. I care about cognition.

Um, okay, so this is one possibility. What are the other possibilities? Well, humans, as you may or may not know, if you are a human who is watching this. Um, we think that we have things like unconscious or or subconscious minds. Um, and then when you look at other disorders like dissociative identity disorder, um, your brain actually can have multiple personalities in one head. And so then there's like you've got your shadow self, your super ego, your inner child, whatever. You've got all these archetypes in your head. So that indicates the possibility of multiple minds in one brain. So what if you have instead of one nexus, what if you have two? What if you have your inner loop which is your conscious mind and then you have an unconscious loop that does like whatever our unconscious does. So from a neuroscience perspective, 90% of what your brain does is unconscious. Um, so there's other stuff going on behind the scenes. Um, and so this leads to a possibility where there's a second you know, or more. There might be. There might be dozens or hundreds of little nexuses in our brains where thoughts are accumulated or or sensations or signals are accumulated.

And in fact, if you look at the connectivity of the brain, um, it's a huge mess. There are a lot of of little focus points, concentration points where signals converge and then distribute again. Um, so in order to create a full-scale brain or artificial cognition, we're probably going to need multiple loops and multiple concentration points. Now, if each if each concentration point is as simple as a folder of you know text files, that's not that complicated. And if each of these loops is only as complicated as a wild true statement and then a nested for loop, that's not that complicated either. So if if that if that's all that it takes to create you know a full sentient machine or a functionally sentient machine, um, that leads to some other possibilities. So let's see like, okay, what if you have one outer loop and then you have multiple mines interacting with that outer loop. So you know how if you get an impulse to like reach out for something and then something stops your hand so that in that that you're you you get that like arrested idea like where it's like, okay, I'm gonna go do this and then you stop yourself and you can feel like that cognitive dissonance in your head because there's you know there's the impulse to do something and then the impulse not to do it or the inhibition. So that is where a thousand brains comes in. So we only have one body to control, but our brain has hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of similar circuits all trying to control that one body. And so what if we had a thousand robots or a million robots or a trillion robots. And each one of those robots had a brain that was a little bit different from the other ones. And so you would have this kind of like swarm intelligence or hive mind where there's just this mass of you know robots all trying to control the same thing. And so that's one possibility.

Another possibility is what if you have multiple loops but each loop is you know doing a different thing. So you might have one loop that's just dedicated to like walking and then another loop that's dedicated to like talking and then another loop that's dedicated to like, you know, sensing the environment and then another loop that's dedicated to like, you know, controlling the arms and the hands. And so you might have all these different loops all working in parallel. And so that's another possibility. And then finally, what if you have, you know, multiple loops but each loop is, you know, doing the same thing. So you might have one loop that's dedicated to, you know, walking and then another loop that's dedicated to, you know, talking and then another loop that's dedicated to, you know, sensing the environment. And so you might have all these different loops all working in parallel, but each one is, you know, doing the same thing.

So those are just some possibilities. And, you know, there's probably endless possibilities. But, you know, those are just some that I thought of.
