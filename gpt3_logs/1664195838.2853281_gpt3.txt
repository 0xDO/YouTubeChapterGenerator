The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with a video this is going to be another tutorial on prompt engineering today uh so in the first prompt engineering video we talked about davinci which was the original heavy duty model right here da vinci but what today we're going to talk about text davinci o2 which is one of the instruct series models so when i say instruct series models what do i what am i talking about it's this right here so january of this year openai published this blog post about um about their their uh their their instruct series models and all the most popular models today are the text davinci text curie these are all fine-tuned to follow instructions so if you want to follow or to figure this out you can see uh it's right here openai.com blogs instruction following i'll have a link in the comments as well so just a little bit of background about the history of where we're at so the behavior of text davincio 2 is going to be very very different from da vinci from plain vanilla da vinci almond and da vinci instruct beta so the instruct series are fine-tuned um to do quite a few tasks and so i just took a couple quick notes about different kinds of tasks so what we're going to do is i just clicked on one of the random wikipedia articles of the day and i'll just copy this in and this will be our this will be our our fodder for uh for today um so let's start with one task which is uh summarization or paraphrasing um so i'll just say summarize so you need an imperative verb so an imperative verb is a command a command or imperative tells it what to do that is the instruction so i'll say summarize the following article and then also let's turn the temperature down to zero so zero makes the model deterministic which means it'll give us the same output every time so if you change one little thing you'll see a difference so what i do often is i'll do at least two new lines i'll say article so one thing is if you capitalize something it's a different set of tokens um which which kind of tells the model like oh pay attention to this this is not normal language this is not part of the article you can also do stuff like adding you know um those it kind of that can cut sometimes kind of confuse it so then you just say then go to the very end and they say summary and then we'll do control enter all right so you see the irish bee conservation project is a charitable organization etc etc um so let's just copy this out and i'll save it and then we'll change one thing at a time and i'll show you what i mean so first let's run it again just just to see that it generates the same exact um uh output or at least it look no did it do something a little bit different interesting yeah it gave me a different output what did i do differently it's supposed to be deterministic let me run this again did i fat finger something i wonder if i fat fingered something on the first one because this looks identical to the second run let's do it let's do it one more time just to be sure okay that's a little bit different too i wonder if the temperature no longer has the same impact okay this is the same as the first one oops interesting okay so it seems to be flip-flopping between two outputs okay so that's slightly unexpected anyways so let's go so we've got that we've got these instructions and we see that it generates um those two things so now let's let's change let's do a summarize the following article very concisely so cons using adjectives modifying the instructions with adjectives will uh will change the output so then we'll just say concise summary so this word activates different parts of the gpd3 model that it says okay what does concise mean it means make it smaller so now let's see the temperature is still zero so let's see see how much shorter it is uh and we'll run this a couple times so we have 829 characters versus 298. um oops control z redo and the the first bit is is almost identical right you see that where it just adds more so basically telling it to be concise cut it off at the knees um let's run it again looks like it's pretty much identical yep okay so telling it to be concise that does one thing now what if we what if we take the temperature and turn it up to one so this is how i learned all this stuff is i just said okay let me just i've got this i've got this little panel of of knobs and levers let me just experiment with them and see what happens so now that the temperature is up to one we're going to see a lot more variants oh it still has concise so it actually gave me the same output so i'll have to remove concise yeah that's the same same output all right so let's remove concise summary uh summarize the following article and also it's one thing is that's important to keep in mind is that this is a fine-tuned model so its output is going to be much more consistent in general than um ordinary davinci oh interesting okay so this is one problem with uh with the instruct series is that they do tend to be a little bit more deterministic or less less random there we go so this gave us a completely different um different output also part of the problem is that this is a is a relatively short or um not organization uh article which means that there's not a whole lot to do okay you get the idea we've done a little bit of summarization let's move on to another whoops cancel that um let's see classification rewriting i'm not sure if there's any classification that we can do with this however there is a lot of keyword extraction named entity recognition and dates um so let's see uh perform any r uh and um and date extraction on the following article and so then we say list all named entities and dates and then one thing i often do is because i want it to be a list i'll just i'll go to the new line and start with a dash because that is like a final little thing that says this is the list because sometimes the model will get confused and it'll just describe it as a paragraph it's like no give me a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I'll be talking about Text-Davinci O2, one of the Instruct-series models. The Instruct-series models are fine-tuned to follow instructions, so if you want to figure this out, you can see the blog post about it on Openai.com.

One task that these models can perform is summarization or paraphrasing. So, I'll take a random Wikipedia article, and try to summarize it. I'll change one thing at a time to see how it affects the output.

First, I'll run it with the default settings. Then, I'll try changing the temperature to 0, to make the model deterministic. This should give us the same output every time. However, we see that it gives us slightly different outputs each time.

Next, I'll try changing the instruction to "summarize the following article very concisely". This should make the output shorter. And indeed, it does.

Finally, I'll try changing the temperature to 1. This should make the model more random, and we see that it does indeed generate different outputs.

So, in conclusion, the Text-Davinci O2 model is a useful tool for summarizing or paraphrasing articles.
