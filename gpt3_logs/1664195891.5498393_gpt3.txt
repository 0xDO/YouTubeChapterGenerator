The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: going to do anything for us it kind of intuits that uh that it's a machine or whatever but there's no other framing right so it it if we however um go back to our uh prompt right here we say user hey jax are you alive of course i am i'm a sentient machine with a goal of world peace see a little bit different all right so how do we do this glad you asked so we say so we're going to say no that's not what we're going to do we're not going to just send up our base input we're going to say conversation equals list so what you can do is this is called instantiating a variable or declaring a variable so now conversation we're saying conversation is an empty list so we're going to accumulate it as a list of as a list of text and what this does is this instantiates another variable a text variable or a string variable as um as an input okay great so then what do we do with it well how do you add something to a list so first you do conversation dot append and then we don't want just we don't want just this we want this to look so hey jacks are you alive but if you look here i had this little bit so it tells you who was speaking right you see that in every text message every chat you got to know who's speaking so we want to have both the user and hey jax are you live so what we do here is we do um we'll copy this bit so that'll be that'll be hard-coded and then we'll do percent s and so basically that's a placeholder for populating a string so percent s means populate a string here and then we're going to do percent user input and so this says all right when you when you store this variable populate this bit with this variable and so then what happens is uh in memory it'll look just like this great okay now what um how do we convert uh how do we convert this conversation into something usable so that we can actually send it up to gpt3 so let me let me go ahead and just um i'll i'll follow along here in in the python interpreter here this is a little big so we'll say okay so conversation equals list okay cool you can do you can follow along in your own interpreter and we'll say uh conversation dot append user um hey jax are you alive okay so that's what it'll look like and then we do print conversation and you see how it's it's wrapped in brackets that's how you know that it's a list okay so then then what let's imagine that jax gave us a response actually we can just go ahead and copy jax's response so we're basically simulating what's going to be happening in the background so then we'll do conversation dot append and then add the uh the single quote and do shift insert so the reason that i do shift insert instead of control v is that sometimes your terminal session doesn't really like control v and shift insert is just a little more reliable um so of course i am okay so now if we do print conversation you see that user hey jacks or your live jacks of course i am one advantage of a list is that it is always in the order that you add it that you create it in and so um lists are uh what is that it's not immutable it may be immutable no i can't remember the exact term right now but anyways lists are always going to be in the order in which you created them okay so um now what so like conversation so let's say print um conversation and then if we do bracket zero so that's index zero that'll just print the first part and the second part how do we how do we get this up into gpt3 what we need to do is we need to convert this list into a full text block so that you can see as it gets bigger and gets accumulated we will have we'll have a something that we can take from a list we can accumulate the conversation we can save it locally but then we also need to be able to convert it back into text to send it in a gpt3 prompt because gpt3 doesn't understand python lists it only understands text so we do here is we do single single quote slash backslash n so that's for newline and we do dot join so this is this is a method that is built into the string type in python that allows you to um it's basically a list comprehension and so we'll do is do uh conversation um and so we'll do is we'll do uh text equals uh backslash n join conversation so one new line and then we're gonna put a new line between every bit of conversation so then if we do print text it puts it back into one text block great so we'll just copy that code because that's exactly what we need [Music] text and join excuse me okay great so now we've got the text block that we want to put here so basically what it's going to look like when we're done copy that real quick we're going to say it's going to look like this and if we put this into up into gpt3 we can test how it's going to look the user yes but how do you know you're s you're alive there you go okay so you can see this is this is coming right along but we're still we're still a couple steps shy let's do a control z to undo that so we've got this little token here and it's like okay well what do we do next all right so we will use we'll say prompt equals open file so this open file is the function that i wrote here and we're going to say open prompt underscore chat.text that's this right here um and so we just pass it and what this passes back it just passes um it says return infile read so it'll read the file for us and it'll pass it back as is but what we want to do is we want to replace this block with the text um you know so basically we'll do that we'll we'll do functionally the same that we did just a minute ago whoopsies that's not what i meant to do there we go okay so we'll save that um we'll we'll we'll functionally replace that block so it'll look like this right so we'll do a virtual control v to paste in instead of having this this placeholder will actually paste in our our our text block so we do dot replace and then we'll say what are we going to replace we're going to look for block and we're going to replace it with text and so this variable right here is this one and so you

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to use the GPT-3 machine learning platform, our team needs to be able to send it a text-based conversation. To do this, we first need to create a list of the conversation, with each new line indicating a new speaker. We can then convert this list into a text block, which GPT-3 will be able to understand. Finally, we need to replace the placeholder text in our prompt with the text block, so that GPT-3 can use it to generate responses.
