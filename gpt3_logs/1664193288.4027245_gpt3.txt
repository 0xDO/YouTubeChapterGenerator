TRANSCRIPT: expecting to recover a dead crew instead they found steve alive and well what happened ask a lead ground crewman i'm not sure said steve one minute i was falling out of control and the next i was floating down to the surface we were expecting to recover a dead man said the lead ground crewman maybe you should consider a different line of work that's great the ai the ai chimed in you would be surprised how often re-entry accidents result in miracles steve just shook his head and said i guess chaos theory is alive and well man this is nice this is really creative the frog prince never flew again but it didn't have but it didn't have to because within two weeks of landing another ship landed with enough customers there was already a waiting list for sheets on other ships that would be flying soon after dave shapiro is an aerospace engineer who has worked on rockets for nasa oh that's very sweet i actually haven't done that boeing and spacex okay cool so it knows what spacex is he lives in seattle with his wife and two sons his short stories have appeared in analog science fiction in fact his short story the martian transit was one honorable mention at the 2014 writers of something okay so here you have it here is a uh here's a co-written short story with uh with gpth3 it is 1200 tokens long which is about um what is it one token so one it's about one word per token if you use conventional ones um some longer words like super lightweight this could be three or four tokens so let's just say this is about a thousand words so this is flash fiction um yeah i had no idea where it was going you saw i just i just gave it an opening prompt and then it just took it and ran with it i did use vanilla davinci which is much better at just writing long form stuff like this i left the the temperature at 0.7 because if you go up too high it gets crazy i did ultimately put the frequency penalty up to 0.5 which forces it to be a little bit more creative so the frequency penalty what this does is the more times a token appears the less likely it is to appear again which is really critical if you're writing long form stuff if you turn this all the way up though you'll end up with really weird things where like the period there will be a space between the periods and stuff because it's like oh well i can't i can't keep using periods because those are uh you know those are those are common tokens um and so if you turn the frequency penalty up too high you'll end up without the ability to use like normal punctuation so there are limits to that but yeah there you have it we just co-wrote a speculative fiction and thriller uh in just a few minutes thanks for watching i hope you liked it

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In 2014, aerospace engineer David Shapiro and GPTH3 co-wrote a short story called "The Martian Transit." The story is about a man named Steve who is involved in a space accident. The lead ground crewman tells Steve that they were expecting to find a dead body, but instead Steve is alive and well. Steve is surprised to find out that chaos theory is at play.

The story is set on a space ship and is about 1000 words long. It is a speculative fiction and thriller. The story ends with the lead ground crewman telling Steve that he should consider a different line of work.
