how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

of retrieving information from memory
when we recall something we are accessing
0:14:22.800,0:14:30.080
memories that are stored in our long-term
memory oh let's wait for it to finish okay
0:14:30.080,0:14:35.760
it's actually not done here let me increase
the length it says hey buddy we're not done
0:14:38.960,0:14:44.640
this might be too long okay uh let's see where
were we we're access when we recall something
0:14:44.640,0:14:49.520
we are accessing memories that are stored in
our long-term memory so long-term memory is
0:14:50.800,0:14:57.440
roughly i'm not going to say equivalent but it's
approximately similar to embedding in gpt3 so
0:14:57.440,0:15:04.160
embedding we'll get to that actually gpt3 might
not be able to give a good definition of embedding
0:15:04.720,0:15:07.840
because it's a newer term where it's going
to have more neuroscience but anyways
0:15:07.840,0:15:12.080
bookmark that we'll talk about embedding in a
second so basically long-term memory is similar
0:15:12.080,0:15:18.560
to embedding recall can be prompted by
internal or external cues internal cues
0:15:18.560,0:15:23.600
include things like our current mood or the
time of day external cues can be anything
0:15:23.600,0:15:30.240
from our from our environment that reminds us
of something from the past so um this idea of
0:15:30.240,0:15:35.520
internal and external cueing i talk about this
in my book um but basically like your brain is
0:15:35.520,0:15:40.160
always searching for memphis related memories
always completely unconscious all the time
0:15:42.240,0:15:46.240
recall is a basic cognitive function
that is essential for everyday life
0:15:46.240,0:15:50.640
without the ability to recall memories we would be
unable to learn from our past experiences or make
0:15:50.640,0:15:55.760
plans for the future recall is also important
for our mental well-being when we recall happy
0:15:55.760,0:16:00.720
memories we can boost our mood and increase
our satisfaction okay that's uh well here
0:16:00.720,0:16:04.800
free recall is when we try to remember something
without any cues that can be more difficult
0:16:04.800,0:16:08.880
cued recall this is when we use external
cues to help us remember information
