TRANSCRIPT: giving me that i needed to split it up into like four different chunks in order to get this answer okay this made the last emperor okay okay so there is relevant information in each of these sections that's great okay so then what we do is we take all this and we say merge the following answers into a single paragraph um the question asked was and that should still be oh darn let me just copy paste this whole thing okay merge the following answers into a single coherent paragraph the question asked was so then we'll do oh i have another thing falling off let me pause real quick okay and we're back all right the question asked was okay and then um various answers so then we'll come back to here and grab wait where did i accumulate those answers here we are various answers and then let's do this all caps various answers and then um merged answer actually let's say merged paragraph see how that does and gaul however rsd's incident marched on rivena the capital of western proclaimed romness and napostead was only a figurehead with orestes running much of the imperial administration interesting okay but it doesn't mention auto asser okay well whatever that's fine let's go whoops let's go to the wikipedia article and see lester captured rivena killing arrestee's deputy okay all right whatever okay so we've got it broken up into a couple sections we summarize it um here i wonder what happens if um that should be fine yeah that'll be fine okay so we'll do one last thing we'll save this as answers question and then we'll do prompt and we'll call this prompt merge okay so then we're closing in on complete i think all right so we got all of our answers and so um answers equals uh no answer equals we'll say space.join answers so that just merges it all into one block and we'll say prompt equals well here we'll just prompt merge and it's we have answers and question so replace question with question i already had that um and then we'll replace uh answers with answer i think that's how i did it yes various answers into a single coherent paragraph the question asked was okay that should work and so then we get that gpt3 completion we do the encoding here so um this was a thing that i started adding because when especially when you use external sources sometimes there's characters that gpt3 does not like but if you convert it to ascii and ignore errors and then decode it back then gpt3 seems to be happy and then return answer okay so we've got we pass it a wikipedia article we ask a question we break it into chunks if necessary might not be necessary we ask questions and then pass it back okay so now that we've got this it's like okay wow we've done a lot now what um so let's copy this and we'll copy this out to here and let's go back here and we'll say background info user um what caused the fall of rome time why didn't you give me an answer there we go but you got to include this hmm because we've got this information which is good so part of the problem is and this this might not work i might have to exclude this part is because this model was not fine-tuned to um was not fine-tuned to incorporate other information ah let's see um oops user i wonder if instead of using the fine-tuned model i could just what if i just exclude the fine-tune model and just have this information it would require it would require um reworking this fine-tuned model so i might have to stop here and and split this up because this fine-tuned model does not know how to incorporate additional information darn but that's okay we're already at almost an hour so it happens we'll stop here we'll leave it off where we need i need to create another model that will incorporate background information external information into the chat because this chat model is already pretty good but it's missing a couple things all right thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The question asked was: What caused the fall of Rome?

The answer is that there is no single cause for the fall of Rome. A variety of factors contributed to the decline and eventual fall of the Roman Empire. These factors include political corruption, economic decline, military weakness, and barbarian invasions.

Political corruption was a major factor in the decline of Rome. Government officials were frequently bribed, and nepotism was common. This led to a lack of competent leadership, and the government became increasingly inefficient.

Economic decline was another factor in Rome's decline. The cost of maintaining the empire's vast territory became increasingly difficult to sustain. Inflation became a major problem, and the standard of living for the average Roman citizen declined.

Military weakness was another factor in Rome's decline. The Roman army became increasingly bloated and inefficient. In addition, the empire's vast territory made it difficult to defend against barbarian invasions.

Finally, barbarian invasions were a major factor in the fall of Rome. The barbarian tribes that invaded Rome were often more skilled and better organized than the Roman army. This led to the fall of the empire.
