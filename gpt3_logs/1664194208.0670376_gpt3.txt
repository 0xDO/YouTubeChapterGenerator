The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: script that i need to write um which is actually preparing the json or i need to fix it so i'll do this while the rest is running um and the re so uh for file and files so i actually got this wrong because instead of prompts um i don't need to i don't need the prompt because then we're just we're doing the prompts i need the stories so stories so we'll have the story the completion so the prompt is going to be the prompt plus slash n actually let's change this to story equals and so then the story is so the kind of clarifying open file stories so we're going to get the story then the prompt is going to be the story plus new line new line and then what i usually do is do the tags do the um the demarcation tag in all caps because then it's very obvious that like this is the end so professional feedback and then add a space and then the completion will be space plus completion um and i think that should be it creativewritingcoach.jsonl um okay let's make sure this is running yes good okay um yeah and then the last thing that we're going to need is the actual fine-tune script so let me copy my fine-tune script from another one fine tune dot pi whoops not recursive summarizer creative writing coach and then we'll edit this with notepad plus plus and we're changing this the name is the creativewritingcoach.jsonl coach okay so that should be good this is going to be a lot of data also um one thing that might happen is if this bombs on any of the um it shouldn't because i have i have the the prompt in there limiting the length so if you look here in the prompts the maximum size is six kilobytes which is um six thousand characters so you can see that um like it is it is very much constrained because one of the biggest risks is if it's going to be too long that can cause it to fail and what i don't have in my script right now i should add this is because if i get a bad if i get a bad output or a bad response this script will bomb in the middle and then i'm going to need to write something to just skip the ones that are already done um because you don't want to regenerate everything um yeah because well no i do have a retry thing in the gpt3 completion where is it the generate completions so right here where i have while true try and accept so this will catch some errors um so it won't bomb but if the prompt is just too long it'll bomb five times in a row and then exit that that loop also if there's any like formatting issues that cause errors and file handling that will also cause it to bomb but so far so good so this will take a little while to finish we've got 388 stories um to do and uh we're sitting pretty at 19 so this is going to take a little while to finish so i'm going to pause the video and then we'll get back once it's time to do the um the data prep and fine-tuning okay not all is well in the valley um i'm watching it run and there's um i noticed that some of the completions are big because you see some of most of them are one kilobyte right so you take a look at it your story has a lot of potential but there are some areas that could use some improvement etcetera etcetera that's fine but then let's look at the bigger ones um so the first one that's two kilobytes says the complement sandwich is a method of blah blah the following constructive like okay i didn't ask it to tell me what the compliment sandwich was um uh so let ba in this case all we have to do is just delete um what we don't want to see that's fine this one the opening of your story that's fine first i will commend you on something you did well in the story so it's like yeah we already did that um i think i know what i can do though i think if i change the prompt um feedback so let's do that um that should fix it because now it's just saying like okay this is what i'm gonna do feedback feedback time um and since my script so the reason that i can do that i've done this deliberately is that in my in my scripts i have it um so see for up for each file it opens the prompt um oh wait no that's not going to work right because i separated the process darn oh actually i know what i can do i updated that so we can get sneaky creative writing coach python prepare prompts so now all the prompts are going to be updated behind the scenes so there we go now that should be fixed okay so because if you're in the middle of a long run and you see some some things you don't necessarily want to interrupt it because if you only have like 5 or ten things that you want to fix before it finishes doing 300 right you don't want to you don't have to stop and restart so got that fixed in i all i did was do this for the prompt because what it what it did was it it queued off of this and just continued explaining i was like oh okay um it didn't with the semicolon or sorry with the colon it didn't realize like okay feedback starts here but now i just made it explicit feedback starts here like this is what i'm gonna do feedback um okay so get rid of that so this is an example of a good one you did a good job of setting the scene okay one suggestion one suggestion the opening of your story is strong that's good first i want to commend you okay so those are ones that i had already fixed um so let's go back to completions and sort by size so let's open all of them that are two kilobytes or larger because those are the ones that are more likely to be problematic okay the opening of your scene is story is good okay that's fine the opening is strong that's good it added some dashes don't need that proxies new okay so this this one where this is an example of what i said where i just continued the story for some reason um so i have no idea why that happened um gpt3 just got um it it came up with its own idea so these ones you know like praxis new without even the smallest nagging doubt the former heart of industry seems so fragile in the dark um oh okay wait this is a great opening line the metal once revered as the backbone of american society this is great

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I'm preparing a JSON file for the Creative Writing Coach bot, and I'm fixing some issues with the prompts. The bot will take a story, then the prompt, and then generate feedback based on the story. I'm currently working on fixing the formatting so that the bot doesn't get confused and generate incorrect feedback.
