TRANSCRIPT: good morning everybody david shapiro here with a video we are going to do some dolly tutorials today um i've got a list of some examples to show you um just uh most of these are going to be style tags just to show you kind of how to get what you what you want out of dolly um just to show you some of the styles so the first one is high fantasy art so let's say alvin archer in um a sunny forest high fantasy art so we'll give that um one thing that i found is that less is more um if you look at some of the some of the good ones you kind of you give it just enough to go on and then you let it go um one thing that i found is i often have an idea in my head as to how i want it to look but it often doesn't work so in this case i just said elven archer into sunny forest and it gave me exactly what i asked for i'm going to save these real quick you can take a quick look this one could be legolas this one's good uh and so the fact that i said like high fantasy art um so that tells you that like it's not gonna be a 3d rendering so let me just show you um if you just change 3d change high fantasy art to 3d render otherwise it stays the same you can get very very very different results um so i'll probably just leave it as elven archer and a sunny forest and then change the tags so that way you can kind of see how how it varies depending on just the style tag that you give it oh this is pretty this looks like it could be from skyrim so very different style still overall the same thing it's interesting they're all pointing to the right um oh there we got one pointing to the left um those arrowheads are really big um so yeah just changing it from high fantasy art you can tell that this is like clearly um like it looks like a digital painting and then the the the 3d render um it's not quite fully rendered-ish looking but it's better like especially when you look at the the light um and the grass it's a little bit different um let's see what else did i do um abstract art oh there we go um abstract art like a dream so this will probably be pretty different i know this is boring sorry it seems like it's going slower than it should or maybe i wasn't talking enough oh okay um so when i say like abstract art like a dream you can see that it's it's it's not attempting to be representational as much this is more impressionistic but there's also artifacts that make it so that like you kind of lose meaning but you can still see that the the archer in the middle is kind of obvious that face is a little unsettling um but you see these um oh what is that called uh my mind blanked um but the the like basically the lens flares um [Music] so it kind of makes it a little more disorienting this one is interesting it's more impressionistic you've got this over saturation of the light to show that it is sunny but i mean i could imagine having a memory like this of a dream this one is really interesting there's a lot of motion blur almost you see it's like this you've got this radial motion blur this is really good let me save that one [Music] almost this one almost looks vaguely like highly stylized um eastern um like a like a video game character like from dynasty warriors um this one looks also vaguely like monkish or or marshall but also like you're really losing some definition um very dreamlike love it and so just showing the difference like this one looks a little bit more like one of the renderings so we've got the dreams then we've got the render and then we've got the high fantasy art so you can see you get very very different um results um let's do wide angle wide angle shot well and i'll change it to photo wide angle photo this will probably look like a cosplayer um it's really interesting i'm not sure what the what the background training data of dolly was because um i put in like ghost in the shell and that was really disturbing it does not know what ghost in the shell is so it seems like the training data that they used they were trying to avoid um anything that was like licensed or anything that was like proprietary um so it gave me like a ghost and then like a bulbous robot um okay so we do have a wide angle shot this is you know you see the sun here um but it's oh we we do have some lens flares so that's that's like an artifact from a real thing the trees look very realistic with the branches and and um yeah trees have branches that's real i realize how silly i must sound sometimes okay um but yeah this looks like it could be a photo shoot from cosplay except we have this uncanny valley thing um that's fine okay what was next aerial drone shot so this will so by changing the perspective so it's kind of redundant because if you just say like drone drone shot that's usually enough if you just say aerial that's enough but i found that if you say like aerial drone shot it will it will definitely give you a high angle high angle shot it's a little bit redundant but it doesn't cost anything extra and i found that you get a little bit more consistent of results so you can see again it's still still an elven archer in a forest but now the perspective is very different this is pretty cool yeah so we got the high angle-ness so think about where you want the perspective to be from um so that worked rather well uh let's see speculative art so one thing that i found especially if you're trying to get something that is like not necessarily realistic like i was trying to do a render of um of a friend's book of a character and they're supposed to be like a cat folk like cat person but it just kept giving like a woman with a cat on her shoulders and i'm like no no no like humanoid cat like cat folk and so if you add something like speculative art or or sci-fi or fantasy then it's like oh you want like you know a khajiit um but otherwise it'll try and keep it photorealistic because if you if you have like cat and woman or you know not catwoman but like cat folk in a shot and i'll show you in a second um because it's really

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Good morning, everyone. In this video, we're going to explore some dolly tutorials. I've compiled a list of examples to show you how to get the results you want from dolly. For most of these, we'll be using style tags.

One thing to keep in mind is that less is often more. If you look at some of the good examples, you'll see that they give just enough information to get the idea across, and then they let the viewer fill in the rest.

For our first example, we'll be doing a high fantasy art piece. So, let's say we're looking for an image of an elven archer in a sunny forest. One thing to note is that if you change the 3D tag to high fantasy art, you'll get very different results. This is because high fantasy art is not meant to be realistic.

Next, we have a wide angle shot. For this, we'll change the perspective to photo. Again, we see that the results are quite different from the previous example. This time, we have a cosplay-esque image with an unsettling uncanny valley effect.

Finally, we have an aerial drone shot. This gives us a high angle view of the elven archer in the forest. Again, we see that changing the perspective can give us very different results.

In conclusion, we've seen that by using style tags, we can get very different results from dolly. By playing around with the tags, we can get the results we want for our specific needs.
