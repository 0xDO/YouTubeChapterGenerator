The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: good um i've had all kinds of issues there was a bad cable um then then my computer turned the the volume of the microphone down like the levels it was down to like 58 so some videos were quiet i think it's okay anyways sorry quick aside um so second script summarize the chunks so this all that this does is it says okay let's take each of the chunks in the chunks folder and create summaries of it so i've got or here let's go let's go open one of them so alice in wonderland 14 so you see like uh it ends perhaps it doesn't understand english some children digging in the sand with wood and spades so then let's see what the result of that is um so we we've the chunks and summaries are one-to-one so every file in the chunks is represented in the summaries and what did i say 14 alice in wonderland 14. so let's go to alice in wonderland 14. and so alice finds herself in a pool of tears and meets a mouse she wonders if the mouse knows the way out and tries to ask it in english the mouse doesn't seem to understand but winks at her so you see like it takes this whole thing and summarizes it and so this is what i mean by in the next script where we've got recursive summaries so like because the over as you make it through the book even a two sentence summary like once you get to 40 of these that's going to be really long so we summarize the summaries that doesn't look like it worked too well that would probably require a um a specialized either prompt or fine-tuned model to summarize it correctly where it's just like okay what is the story so far give it to me in five sentences um other people have pointed out that maybe maybe there's um some people on i think it was reddit and youtube other techniques there's a lot of experimentation that can be done sounds like a lot of you have good ideas so i'm probably about done with this project so if you have ideas like please take a fork of this um and and try it out um you'll notice in the summarized chunks i had i have got a few things commented out it's because um i had already run it against these four books and i added three more so i just commented these out um to skip them um all right i skipped them and then i commented it out so that that way like you can see how the code was supposed to run same thing right here where the first time i ran it i only did the first 10 samples or 11. i my math logic was was wrong and so then i commented this out to skip it and then this is what i did to make it stop at 40 samples um yep so this the all that this does is fill up this folder the summaries folder uh so we're moving right along then the recursive summaries so this actually does two things um it it uh you see right here down at the end save file um the prompt uh is it fills up the prompt and completion folder so and basically it does a little bit of stuff to pull all the data together um all the other like the books the chunks the outlines all that um is pulled together into here so like outline alice is a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow story so far alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she had it has adventures with strange creatures and then it carries on obviously like the story so far because this is chunk number six probably needs to be a little bit more detailed but i bet if we go to the previous one yeah you see how it's four kilobytes so what happened was it had this summary and then it triggered to do the recursive summary so it says okay let's take this and then write a super concise summary let's put these in order so here's number five and then here's number six and i asked it to write a very concise summary and it did so it's like okay that's a little bit too concise right this is what i mean by like i'm gonna need to we're gonna need to work on a fine-tuned model that is that specializes in writing summaries that are like 1500 characters um regardless of how long it is um and i know that uh openai published a blog or a paper about recursive summarization so probably what i need to do is go review that and and copy their um their uh their success anyways um so that's that's the that's the most broken section is is doing these recursive summaries and here's here's how it that works that summary chunk actually why did i close those let me open these back up so these summary chunks are stored in this variable here summary chunk so when you start the book summary chunk is nothing so then for summary and summaries so that this list of summaries comes from this folder so for all of these we want to kind of inch along and then recursively summarize them and so then if the length of the summary when we add when we add the next one so accumulate all the summary so far if it's too long then we trigger then we trigger the summarizing the summaries thing um and so we open the file we open the the summary prompt and we put the chunk in and then we summarize it um and so basically the summary becomes really short this logic is going to be the most fragile part of this project so far so if you've got ideas about how to overhaul this i know a few of you have already commented on youtube and read it but if you've got other ideas or you want to try something on your own please take a copy of the code and try it out so at the end of this once this is done running we have the prompt and completions full and so then i just have this really short script that takes um takes the the contents from those prompts and completions and remember they're paired so the file name is identical under prompts and completion so like um if you look under um you know great gatsby 17 under prompts that one is paired with great gatsby 17 under completions um and that is how it knows which one goes where so it's like there's a bird on the lawn i think it must be a nightingale come over on the canard or white star line so you see where it's just like okay it just picks up right where it left off carries on um so we format the json l and then i've got my

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I've been having some issues with my computer. The first problem was a bad cable, and then my computer turned the volume of the microphone down to 58. This caused some videos to be quiet.

I've been working on a project that involves summarizing text. The project takes chunks of text and creates summaries of them. For example, the chunk "Alice in Wonderland 14" is summarized as "Alice finds herself in a pool of tears and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her."

I'm now working on a recursive summarization feature, which will take summaries and create even shorter summaries. This is proving to be a bit tricky, as it's difficult to create a concise summary that still tells the story. I'm hoping to get some help from the community to fine-tune this feature.

Once the project is complete, it will output a file called "prompt and completion." This file contains the text of the story so far, which can be used to continue the story.
