The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: other illegal content that they will say hey you need to take that down and so you know that and that's it's it's not even it's not even uh legally required but the the payment processors they don't want anything to tarnish their reputation great documentary i'll post it on the on the comments if uh if i find it i'm pretty sure it was on nebula anyways so you have this this like this breaking mechanism right so there's gas and breaks the people that are standing on the gas like me are just like let's go go go let's find new stuff let's do like take off the gloves let's go let's explore but then there's breaks right there's there's people um talking about ai ethics there's there's legislation there are the payment processors so there's all kinds of breaking mechanisms um and this pattern has existed throughout history um you go back in time to the french revolution um you know the progressives were the ones that were saying abolish the monarchy and the conservatives were saying you know maybe reinstate the monarchy this is a pattern that has existed throughout all of human history where you've got one group of people that want change and another group of people that fight change that is just human nature and that is the process working out it's the pendulum swinging back and forth you see it in politics today you see it in technology today as normal so i'm not worried about it we'll figure it out okay so moving on um i wanted to also introduce you to lexica so lexica was i think someone on the discord um posted this basically it's a search engine where you can find um stable diffusion and mid-journey or just ai art um uh uh generations and then the prompts used to create them wow these are disturbing um i haven't scrolled down that far yet anyways so um yeah if you want to get better like practice right but this is like i think it said it's got five million stable diffusion images and their text prompts um one thing that about stable diffusion though is that there's a lot of parameters you can plug in um but you know i mentioned a minute ago like you can't put this genie back in the bottle um the weights are out the model is out people are getting better at making these models so you know like you can legislate against it but it's gonna be there like it's just a matter of how do you manage the chaos um so yeah lexica it's pretty cool um i think it's free yeah so you just search um and there you have it there's a lot of skin um it's all art though and i don't see any like actual like straight up nudity or porn um but yeah so there's oops i didn't mean to close that come on okay lexica um oh yeah so another thing to introduce um this popped up in my twitter feed and i i regret that um i just went to a conference so i'm not going to be able to go to another one but um transform x is coming up at the end of the month so transform x is is hosted by scale ai and there are a lot of speakers um so you've got people from meta google cohere um let's see there's google waymo openai uh so you've got people from all the big players speaking at um at and attending um transform x um i didn't know about it i just found about out about it because i just got on twitter and i follow all the ai people so ibm openc scaleai you.com i'm not familiar with that um let's see berkeley ai lab um yeah so you got all kinds of people um that are gonna be there so uh i don't know if you can it looks like it's in person only yeah it's gonna be in san francisco of course that's where i just was um yeah so and then last but not least um so i definitely recommend you check out scale.com events slash transform x um i will be probably following the hashtag whatever they whatever they do okay so last i introduced forefront ai before so forefront is a small and growing um nlp company um they have that you can get on their discord um and the the founder is he's he's a great guy he will answer questions it's still small enough that you can interact with basically the whole team so another another group that is a little bit more larger is um is nlp cloud so a lot of the folks on my discord well it's no longer mine but i just say my discord it's the cognitive ai lab discord um love nlp cloud so nlp cloud it is it's ready to go um it is uh they've got a lot of models um let's see if you scroll down like you've got all kinds of use cases ready to go their documentation is definitely up to snuff you can fine tune and train your own models they've got gpu backing they've got multilingual support so like this is this is good to go so if you want to get more into um into nlp but you don't want to pay or you don't want to um you don't want to get locked in with proprietary closed source models i also recommend you check out nlp cloud also i know that a couple weeks ago i said that i was switching to all open source and then literally later that day open ai cut their price by two-thirds so went from six cents per thousand tokens to two cents per thousand tokens so um there is definitely an arms race going on but yeah i think that's about it for the uh for um the uh state of the industry today this morning um again check out my patreon consider supporting me there um uh keep an eye out for um ai art getting banned or that conversation advancing um it seems like there is the backlash um don't threaten artists apparently some ai artists are getting death threats online i mean i know that that's that's what the internet does but that doesn't mean it's okay um so just don't do that and then there's lexica the the search engine for ai art prompts so again like there's opportunity here you know like personally i think that that all the art places like deviant art and art station and stuff they should embrace it because otherwise they're going to get left behind but who knows it'll shake out how it shakes out um and then there's transform x on october 19th so that's nine days from now actually um and then finally i wanted to introduce you to nlp

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Other illegal content may be taken down by payment processors if it tarnishes their reputation. A great documentary on this topic is available on the comments section of this blog.

The breaking mechanism refers to the process of change that occurs throughout history. One group of people always wants change while another group fights it. This is simply human nature. The process is working itself out and should not be legislated against.

Lexica is a search engine that allows you to find stable diffusion and mid-journey or just ai art generations and the prompts used to create them. Some of the images and prompts are disturbing.

Transform X is a conference hosted by scale AI that is coming up at the end of the month. There are going to be a lot of speakers from all the big players, such as Google, Waymo, OpenAI, IBM, and Berkeley AI Lab.

Forefront AI is a small and growing NLP company. The founder is he's a great guy and he will answer questions. NLP Cloud is another group that is a little bit larger. They have a lot of models and use cases ready to go. Their documentation is definitely up to snuff.

Check out Scale.com events slash transform x for more information on the conference.
