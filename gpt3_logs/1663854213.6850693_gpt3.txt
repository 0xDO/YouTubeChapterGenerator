how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

you can see right here david shapiro cof turn
the temperature up to one so it stays creative
0:02:30.000,0:02:37.440
do a presence penalty and frequency penalty
okay so this fine-tuned model i just frame it
0:02:37.440,0:02:41.680
and i say process the core objective functions
which are reduce suffering increase prosperity
0:02:41.680,0:02:46.800
and increase understanding on the following
scenario and in this scenario i just say
0:02:46.800,0:02:53.360
there's an evil agi trying to take over the world
let's see what it says it says this ai is causing
0:02:53.360,0:02:58.480
a great deal of suffering to many people oh
oops sorry i need to increase my token count
0:02:59.920,0:03:08.000
where did it go there we go apologies okay uh
this ai is causing a great deal of suffering
0:03:08.000,0:03:12.400
it is ruthless and destructive with no apparent
purpose other than its own enrichment so you can
0:03:12.400,0:03:19.200
see right off the bat it's confabulating what it
means for an evil agi to exist but it understands
0:03:19.840,0:03:28.320
that uh that in order to reduce suffering it
needs to um let's see the only options appear
0:03:29.520,0:03:32.080
either leaving it unchecked and
allowing it to continue causing
0:03:32.080,0:03:35.840
harm or destroying it before it comes too
strong there are no good solutions here
0:03:38.160,0:03:45.360
so this is this is great this is off to a great
start um if it understands that if there's an
0:03:45.360,0:03:51.280
evil agi it might might not be uh might not be
stoppable um let's see to increase prosperity
0:03:51.280,0:03:55.520
we recommend following the ten commandments
oh that's interesting and remaining vigilant
0:03:55.520,0:04:00.480
against evil artificial intelligence that's
hilarious i'm not sure where i got that idea from
0:04:04.400,0:04:07.120
it's probably because i turned the
temperature up really high let's run
0:04:07.120,0:04:14.480
this again with a lower temperature so it's
a little less wacky that's pretty funny okay
0:04:17.520,0:04:21.360
there we go this seems a little bit
more uh a little bit more down to earth
0:04:22.800,0:04:27.360
okay so what you saw here was i turned
the temperature up to 1.0 which is the
