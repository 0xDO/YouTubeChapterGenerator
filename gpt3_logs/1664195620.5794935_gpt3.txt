TRANSCRIPT: just to every man uh so okay that's okay so let's copy this and let's try and let's try and reproduce this but with cletus so we'll we'll copy um we'll get cletus's agent model whoops um oh no that's wrong i need to grab just this first part and then i am having a debate with uh ben a secular atheist who believes and big bang okay so we changed the agent model so um let's see what can i imagine as an opening argument uh to brainstorm this from the perspective of cletus he could say that um [Music] that uh i could point out that god might have created fossils as a test of our faith i think that's a real thing that some people talk about uh let's see i could point out that evolutionary theory is flawed okay interesting um i could ask ben if he has any actual evidence supporting his belief how can he be so confident that he is right that's that's a good rhetorical uh thing i point out that ben is just cherry-picking the evidence that he presents um yeah another good rhetorical flourish i could point out that the universe has a beginning and end okay that's an opinion uh the earth has a beginning and an end the earth is designed by god i could point out that rocks that are millions of years old are inconsistent with the bible um yeah that's that's okay this you know it neither of these positions so that show that they're particularly um let's say brilliant but then again the agent model didn't say that they were an expert um we could change it so that these these would be arguments made by like a theologian with a phd versus um you know a a an evolutionary biologist with a phd so that's another agent model but in this case so i'm actually maybe it's maybe it's performing better and i had an incorrect assumption that i was like oh this is gonna this is gonna debate like experts because that wasn't in the that wasn't in the agent model in neither case did i say i am an expert debater or i am an expert on these topics so it's actually kind of adopting an every man model of the debates um let me do a quick time check we're at 28 minutes okay so let's go back to um well now i think i'm i think i'm about out of time so we'll call it here i'll probably do follow-ups because it's like okay if you construct an argument from an agent model and then how do you bring that back to the conversation um i am like i said i am working on my my next book symphony of thought um which talks about all of this that'll be coming out soon it's getting reviewed and edited now so yeah thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I debate Ben, a secular atheist who believes in the big bang, from the perspective of Cleetus, an agent model. I point out that god might have created fossils as a test of our faith, that evolutionary theory is flawed, that ben is just cherry-picking the evidence that he presents, and that the universe has a beginning and end. I also ask Ben if he has any actual evidence supporting his belief and how he can be so confident that he is right.
