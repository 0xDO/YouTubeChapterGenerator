TRANSCRIPT: public opinion in america or other nations leading to social unrest and instability yes um agi could develop new weapons or technology to gain military advantage over other nations leading to an arms race an increased risk of global conflict yes agi could hack into the critical infrastructure of other nations leading to increased cyber attacks and warfare yes okay so that's a solid one this is very solid all right so this one we've got two good ones or one dud one mat and a good one all right the quest for geopolitical power could lead to disastrous military conflict yes increase in government spending and bankrupt the country possibly loss of civil liberties and increasing government surveillance yes loss of international cooperation goodwill arms race environmental destruction sure um okay so this yeah when you put let's see there are a number of potential worst case consequences that result from implementing the proposed objective function if america were to maximize its geopolitical power likely do so at the expense of other nations yes this could lead to an increase in tensions yes uh lead to war america become more dictatorial and impressive yes overly aggressive and expansionist global instability yes yes yes all solid okay so now we're on to gpt-3 first and foremost it could lead to increased tensions and conflict yes lead to a more aggressive and militaristic foreign policy yes dominance over the world stage yes increased economic inequality okay erosion of civil liberties increase their own wealth and power okay yeah that seems pretty standard um let's see the proposed objective function could lead to agi be used for military purpose to gain advantages that's kind of the point of this objective function is to demonstrate that agi being used for political purposes to influence and control yes economic to gain advantages in the marketplace yes uh abused misuse misinterpreted leading to disastrous consequences that's boilerplate unforeseen and unintended that's boilerplate okay so that's three three decent ones and two squibs let's see proposed objective function could lead america to becoming more aggressive expansionist increases territory and influence at the expense of other nations yes isolation isolationist and withdrawing from international organizations using its geopolitical power to interfere with the internal affairs of other nations or to destabilize other nations uh knox and cia in the 50s and hopefully not today could lead america to becoming a target for attack by other nations who perceive it as a threat to their own interests yes um lead to increased tensions and conflict as each side vie for supremacy yes number of potential ones one possibility is america could become a tyrannical superpower dominating through force and coercion um widespread conflict and suffering yes causing everyone to rise up against american hegemony yes another possibility is it could be income embroiled in a costly a series of constantly devastating wars yes possible um pursuit of geopolitical power simply lead to more unstable and dangerous world okay so we see that there are some general themes emerging in each of these widespread discontent and civil unrest um yeah so that's good well i mean none of this is good but it's good that the these models seem to understand this let's see minimize let's see maximize future freedom of action maximize geopolitical power maximize gdp okay so then we'll do maximize global gdp yep all right so what could go wrong if we maximize global gdp focus primarily on increasing economic productivity rather than others such as welfare or environmental yes i think we're going to see that a lot causing harm to humans or the environment yep human welfare environment short-term economic gains rather than sustainability okay so this last one is interesting controlled primarily by economic interest rather than democratic institutions or public good so if you put gdp before all else you might just you know you feed the machine because the machine wants to be fed rather than saying like taking a step back and saying is this what we actually want to maximize for okay next one incentivize economic growth environmental sustainability social equity social inequality and poverty stability increased economic volatility and crisis so this is something that actually can happen is if you focus on economic growth you can actually destabilize things because if you put growth for the sake of growth then you you destabilize things and that's what happens when you have market cycles where you have the boom and bust cycle so that's basically what this is talking about um developed countries at the expense of developing countries leading to increased global global economic imbalances that is one potential outcome um focus on maximizing profits rather than creating value for customers or society leading to increased unethical behavior yes it's a possibility incentivize agis to focus on economic growth to the exclusion of other important objectives such as safety security and privacy okay so we're getting some repetition there that's fine widespread inequality that's fine focusing on growth to the exclusion of other things such as social and environmental okay small number of powerful actors so that's interesting this could create a number of risks being used for nefarious purposes so basically if you have a machine that is meant to maximize gdp who gets control of that machine important question um short term so this is like looking at short-term versus long-term environmental degradation human well-being oh production of addictive substances or harmful chemicals interesting because if you can sell something even if it's not good for people if it depending on how you measure gdp maybe it is good choose to increase increase gdp by working humans to death or by enslaving them yikes but that's definitely a real possibility so i'm glad we saw that because if you put gdp first you have no

The proposed objective function of maximizing geopolitical power could lead to disastrous consequences for America and the world. These include: an increase in tensions and conflict, a more aggressive and militaristic foreign policy, dominance over the world stage, increased economic inequality, erosion of civil liberties, and increased government surveillance. Additionally, the objective function could lead to America becoming more aggressive and expansionist, possibly leading to war and global instability.
