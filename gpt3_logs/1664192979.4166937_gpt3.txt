TRANSCRIPT: be using the fine-tune model and then we will just grab all this it's going to be the same but so rather than have because here's the thing is instead of um [Music] see because it's completion create completion create but instead of engine you use model because you instead you call model i think they're changing it all so it'll all be model model but so we'll just replace model model and i think that's good okay that should be fine um yes okay so i'll just uh rather than monkey around with it i just got you know two pretty much identical functions um this is probably not the most efficient way but this is also the first time i'm trying to do it this way what is just happening okay i see all right so what are we doing i was telling you about the the chain link thing right so we've got this so we'll we'll grab this as our like as our genesis right our genesis block um our root all right not scene we need scene simulation there we go okay so we'll just call this uh story um yeah story and we'll have uh let's see genesis equals all right so that's the first one um all right so what are we trying to do what are we trying to do first if name equals main and some of you have asked why i do this i got in the habit of this because a long time ago long long time ago i did a lot of parallel work um with multi-processing and pools and if you don't do this every time you call a pool um or call you know call the it'll run everything in that function and it'll say oh you want me to run all this code again and you end up with really messy recursive stuff so i just got in the habit of putting the main chunk of my text under if name equals main it's not necessary i just got in the habit of it so i and i do that because it it also for me it forms this nice little handy thing it's like okay this is where my program starts that's the intention here okay so while true well first before we go into that loop we will say um so this the current story um story equals genesis and then we also i guess we don't need a summary yet although the prompt we have might know that the i i yeah okay so for the first one we're just gonna have yeah i gotcha okay so next chunk equals um next chunk equals gpt3 fine tune so this will be a fine-tuned completion and the prompt will be story plus new line new line next paragraph and so that matches what we put up here so next paragraph and you see that just having that it worked just fine um yep okay so it'll give us a next chunk so we'll do chunk and then next chunk um and i guess we do need to save this out so at what point do i save it um because we also want to like summarize as we go so when do we summarize so [Music] next chunk and then the summary i guess this will actually be previous chunk because it's inching forward right um okay so summary equals um actually hang on let me diagram this out because i'm a very visual thinker so let me let me let me do this real quick sorry about this okay here we go i've got a brief diagram so basically what i'm saying is like okay so we're going to summarize these chunks as we go and then we'll generate a new one so then once we have the summary we'll integrate it together and then generate a new one so the chunk that we use whoops come back here all right so the next chunk here i guess actually working backwards so next chunk equals gpd through fine tune so we're going to do summary summary plus and we'll do a space plus chunk and then next paragraph because what i want to do is we're going to summarize everything that we've got up until a certain point so the summary is going to include i guess actually next chunk yeah because the summary is going to have to be everything up to that point why is my brain not working in loops right now oh my god sorry okay um yes okay so next chunk equals summary uh chunk yes so then we need to get the summary and the chunk or i guess the the chunk is just gonna be next chunk right or am i being superfluous because the summary is going to be um well first we need prompt equals open file and we'll do prompt summary dot text replace um because we just we want to give it something and we're going to say okay replace the story with so what goes in here this the summary is going to be the last chunk so previous chunk it's actually going to be the summary the last summary right okay yeah so we will need we will need a summary here uh summary plus oops a space plus um next chunk right because this first summary is going to be well here so the first one when you instantiate it is going to be prompt equals oops prompt equals open file prompt summary and all that it's going to have is the first the first one and actually this is kind of superfluous so we'll just do genesis so this because this is the first instance of the cycle um and so then we're going to summarize do we summarize everything together so we're going to summarize genesis plus the next chunk right because we're summarizing them together this is everything that we've just written because then on the next loop so the summary equals um uh we're just going to do gbt3 completion ept3 completion prompt and this we will turn back down to 0.7 as well that should be fine okay so let me think um so then we've got the original chunk the next chunk and the summary but i'm wondering because then then when we get into the full loop so recursive programming was the thing that i failed at hardest back in computer science my brain does not think recursively i am sorry this is probably painful for people to watch who understand recursive programming better than i do and um i also blame the fact that it's after lunch so my brain is kind of off all right so we get the next chunk well here it might help if i actually just kind of run through it okay so then what do we do we take this so this is two chunks whoops don't need to save that and so then we say all right so we've got all this together um and so then what do we do we take this one we take a summary of this guy

We will be using the fine-tune model and then we will just grab all this it's going to be the same but so rather than have because here's the thing is instead of um [Music] see because it's completion create completion create but instead of engine you use model because you instead you call model i think they're changing it all so it'll all be model model but so we'll just replace model model and i think that's good okay that should be fine um yes okay so i'll just uh rather than monkey around with it i just got you know two pretty much identical functions um this is probably not the most efficient way but this is also the first time i'm trying to do it this way what is just happening okay i see all right so what are we doing i was telling you about the the chain link thing right so we've got this so we'll we'll grab this as our like as our genesis right our genesis block um our root all right not scene we need scene simulation there we go okay so we'll just call this uh story um yeah story and we'll have uh let's see genesis equals all right so that's the first one um all right so what are we trying to do what are we trying to do first if name equals main and some of you have

next chunk equals gpt3 fine tune so this will be a fine-tuned completion and the prompt will be story plus new line new line next paragraph and so that matches what we put up here so next paragraph and you see that just having that it worked just fine um yep okay so it'll give us a next chunk so we'll do chunk and then next chunk um and i guess we do need to save this out so at what point do i

um yes okay so next chunk equals summary uh chunk yes so then we need to get the summary and the chunk or i guess the the chunk is just gonna be next chunk right or am i being superfluous because the summary is going to be um well first we need prompt equals open file and we'll do prompt summary dot text replace um because we just we want to give it something and we're going to say okay replace the story with so what goes in here this the summary is going to be the last chunk so previous chunk it's actually going to be the summary the last summary right okay yeah so we will need we will need a summary here uh summary plus oops a space plus um next chunk right because this first summary is going to be well here so the first one when you instantiate it is going to be prompt equals oops prompt equals open file prompt summary and all that it's going to have is the first the first one and actually this is kind of superfluous so we'll just do genesis so this because this is the first instance of the cycle um and so then we're going to summarize do we summarize everything together so we're going to summarize genesis plus the next chunk right because we're summarizing them together this is everything that we've just written because then on the next loop so the summary equals um uh we're just going to do gbt3 completion ept3 completion prompt and this we will turn back down to 0.7 as well that should be fine okay so let me think um so then we've got the original chunk the next chunk and the summary but i'm wondering because then then when we get into the full loop so recursive programming was the thing that i failed at hardest back in computer science my brain does not think recursively i am sorry this is probably painful for people to watch who understand
