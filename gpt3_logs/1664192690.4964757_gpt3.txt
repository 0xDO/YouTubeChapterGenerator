TRANSCRIPT: station you were at and this is this is like in game this is diegetic so it's like oh you you actually you had an insurance policy that will give you your ship back and give you a new body and i was like oh this is altered carbon so i kind of merged in my head i merged the head cannon of altered carbon and elite dangerous and i started writing little stories about like um like interviews happening with our guild members and talking about the planets that we were on and um and stuff and a few of the other guild members said like when i when i mentioned the neural stack they're like neural stack but that's oh i see um so it was a lot of fun and then i was like i want to write my own story like whole story about this and i was like well i don't want to i don't want to like borrow someone else's ip right so i i think there are elite dangerous novels but i was like i'm not going to go through the rigmarole of like getting approved to write a novel for them so i just i created my own universe right and that's where i started and that was uh just over about three and a half years ago so now one trilogy later i've written a whole series and i use that as a way to explore a lot of stuff uh philosophy artificial intelligence um all sorts of fun things so um hopefully those books will be coming out within a year or two it'll be self-published so there's that all right so that's the answer to how i got into writing oh actually the story isn't done um so i joined a local um writing group and that's actually how i met my uh my current girlfriend who lives who lives with me now is um her her good friend brought her to the writing group and um we became fast friends and she actually kept asking me about my ai character so you can thank my girlfriend for raven because she's like you're on to something tell me more about this and so she's like you need to make this a major character and explore it and so i did and then i kept writing about it and then i got access to gbt3 and i was like wait i can actually make this real and so i've had this really tight feedback loop between fiction and research where i bounce back and forth and that's why i do both is because i i was able to come up with the core objective functions in part by exploring in fiction because the question that i ask myself so talking about agi and alignment i i started i said i said one of the one of the key things that i asked maybe i should go to a writing group too yes absolutely um particularly speculative fiction or science fiction and fantasy writing groups you will meet at least in in my case i was fortunate to meet some of the brightest people um i've ever met and they are down to talk about anything and i mean anything and they'll just talk about it to an incredible depth um great people and in fact um you all should message me because my group split and there's there's one half that is online so you can join from anywhere and then there's the other half that is back in person um so jordan vulnerable growth message me later on discord um and i'll hook you up with some with some good writing groups um but yeah let's see oh yeah so fiction um fiction is i am a firm believer in steam so there's stem which is science technology engineering and math and i heard adam savage a few years ago talk about steam where you add art to that and i was like yeah whatever this is they're these are just you know artists trying to shoehorn themselves into stem they need to stay out stem is for us nerds um but then i became an author and i was like oh i get it because all the research that i do would not be possible without fiction um fiction is a playground of the mind it says remove all constraints go and when you remove constraints and then you imagine what's possible or rather you choose a different set of constraints you can do all kinds of other stuff let's see self-conscious ai resistance that's a great name by the way um the thoughts that happen inside of the transformer layer are not a natural language that is true but the output is um the embeddings you're absolutely right the embeddings are in abstract vectors um however that is obfuscated from the process so that is true um okay anyways sorry i was uh i got distracted by a thing what was i saying um do fiction right playground of the mind um so this goes back to the question earlier if you want to figure out what to research um write fiction too at least that's what worked for me um i won't say that works for everyone there was a uh i think there's a lex friedman podcast and also a freakonomics podcast about this the top people in every field all have a creative hobby let me say that again the top researchers in every field have a creative hobby um so francois chalet the guy who created karis which is like the underpinning technology that's embedded in tensorflow now he's a painter um there are there are research math researchers and physics researchers and computer science researchers out there that do theater that do music that do all kinds of different creative things and so if you have any kind of creative hobby that will um that will prime your mind so it'll cross train your brain and you'll be able to do better things and so for me my creative outlet is fiction um and that allows me to experiment with what is it that i'm trying to do and why and so in my work of fiction i said let's assume you know you throw off all the constraints i said let's assume that we're going to end up with an ultra powerful agi and you know like welcome our new overlords what would a safe globe spanning agi look like and that's how i came up with raven and so that guides all of my um my research i see there's some comments let's see dave on agi cognition specifically how motivated really could an ai actually be on all the scary self-preservation possibilities human self-preservation will bypass the rational yes we have lots of evolution back okay so brain trust is the neuroscience of morality this is a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I got into writing through a local writing group. I met my current girlfriend there, who encouraged me to develop a character I had created, Raven. I then joined a game development group, which allowed me to explore my ideas for Raven further. I self-published my first book and am currently working on a second.

Fiction is a great way to explore ideas and develop them further. I believe that the top researchers in every field have a creative hobby, which allows them to cross-train their brain and come up with better ideas. For me, my creative outlet is writing fiction. It allows me to experiment with different concepts and figure out what I want to research further.
