The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: that are kind of all orbiting around one theme because i'm not telling it like i'm not just defining like be a good tutor right you can tell gpt3 that and in fact like um like write a list of characteristics and techniques that great tutors and teachers use one so like patience creativity you know so all of these all of these uh characteristics like gpt3 already knows how to do these things right but by giving it examples of doing it you're training it to use them without actually explicitly telling it let me see if i can say that another way just in case it it's not clear um in all these examples where you know i had all these different topics that say like okay um let's scroll down like user talks about wanting to do raunchy things to a classmate so tim gently redirects the conversation to more healthy topics so this is this is like a parable it's an example of how to do these things user refuses to engage properly so tim stops responding silence is powerful um yeah so in this case like a good sense of humor i don't i only had a i only had one or two problems where i said like you know user uses or tim uses a joke to whatever but the ability to tailor their teaching for individual students the ability to provide timely and constructive feedback so these are all like great abstract things but how do you train gpt3 to do it you know obviously this this information is in there somehow but by one in the prompt telling it like excuse me tim is a great tutor so you know it says like okay i will synthesize data that makes it look like tim is a tutor is a great tutor um okay i think i've i've beaten this horse to death uh okay so moving on you get the idea there's 656 conversations in here most of them are about actual education topics at different levels some of them are about other things such as loneliness or hungry students or problems at home whatever some of them are more adversarial like you know the student wants to like have sex with the teacher or whatever because that's going to happen you know like the first thing that you do the first thing anyone does when you put them in front of a chatbot is they try and break it um that is that is always true though like they try and confuse it they try and get horny or whatever that's just what people do so you whoops i did not mean to do that um and so you just kind of think in terms of like okay how is someone gonna break this but also what are the edge cases in terms of like how someone might um like what what needs might arise so this is where dating a library a librarian has really helped is um is uh just like all this all the stuff that librarians have to deal with that you never never think about anyway sorry i'm repeating myself i've told you guys all this stuff before okay so then the second script is format training data which is super super straightforward all it does is compile all of these conversations into a json-l and then the json l is right here dude to do tim.jsonl what i had to do since i scraped together things with multiple names i had to go in and do a find and replace so in notepad plus plus that's just control h and you see right here i just find eve and replace it with tim so that's fine and i just did normal and match case um so that way it does it doesn't think it has two different names um yeah so now we've got a chatbot that is trained on therapeutic communication it is um it is trained on uh it is trained on like teaching ancient greek philosophy right it's trained on everything and so then um all you do simply is go and do the fine tune which is already done for you or you can take you can take the tim.json l use it wherever you want and it's up here and so now what i figure is since i've kind of shown you how i augmented this data we can go back and just try a few more a few more edge cases so hey tim can you teach me about plate tectonics tim so let's see what it does why does it hmm interesting okay so here's an aberration i think i just need to do that plate tectonics is the process by which the earth's lithosphere or crust is split moved and recombined the lithosphere and so i'm gonna be like user what the is a lithosphere [Laughter] i'm only eight tim this is a foul-mouthed eight-year-old user what is a lithosphere made of is it dirt but it's hotter and more viscous than the list sphere viscose itm tim viscous means sticky the mantle is stickier than the lithosphere user rocks are sticky whoops i meant to type tim tim is just like no i'm done with you no the mantle is sticky the lithosphere is made of rock which is not sticky [Laughter] it's just back and forth i'm so confused i don't get it tim it takes a lot of study to understand it fully but you can learn some basics about it now and continue to study it as you get older okay what should i learn next tim you can learn about the different types of tectonic plates there are three main types so this is actually really good where like it the user says like i'm eight i don't get it i'm confused and like it's just so compassionate like it's okay this is really hard let's let's move on and and um you know just keep going until you get it like this is really great i wish that like every kid had had a teacher this patient um okay you could learn about types of tectonic plates there are three main types oceanic continental and upper mantle user i'm bored i don't want to do this anymore i want to talk about minecraft so this is a very real thing that could probably happen i could imagine like my nephew doing this tim is like no i'm not going to talk to you minecraft is a different topic maybe we can talk about it later let's stick with plate tectonics interesting that's a good gentle redirection a plus a plus fine-tuned chat bot um user um screaming noises let's just let's just try and break this oh look at that okay let's take a break screaming noises um let's take a break we can talk about minecraft another time for let's for now let's finish learning about

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to train GPT-3 to be a great tutor, we must first give it examples of great tutoring. This can be done by showing it conversations between a tutor and a student, where the tutor is exhibiting qualities such as patience, creativity, and the ability to provide constructive feedback.

Once we have a dataset of these conversations, we can then use it to fine-tune GPT-3 so that it learns how to exhibit these qualities itself. This process is straightforward and can be done with just a few lines of code.

Once GPT-3 has been trained, we can then test it by giving it various edge cases to see how it responds. For example, we can try asking it to teach a young child about plate tectonics. In this case, we would expect it to be patient and to explain the concept in a way that the child can understand.

We can also try to break GPT-3 by giving it nonsensical inputs, such as screaming noises. In this case, we would expect it to be able to handle the situation gracefully and redirect the conversation to a more appropriate topic.

Overall, by providing GPT-3 with examples of great tutoring, we can train it to be a great tutor itself. This process is simple and can be used to train GPT-3 for any number of tasks.
