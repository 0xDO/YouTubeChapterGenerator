The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: scene into first person but what else can we do um so let's say uh given the following scene describe the main character in great detail um imagine the details if you need to all right scene so there's the scene um let's see uh [Music] uh let's see figure out the following um let's see we want their uh list out their backstory their backstory motivation um uh let's see beliefs flaws strengths um preferences likes and dislikes um let's see motivations or goals beliefs and connections friends family Etc okay detailed list of character traits and so then we'll just copy what's up here so we'll say backstory now let's see what it does oh this is great it can also be quite gullible kind and caring she's also very brave preferences Sandy's like the likes the beach and ocean Sandy's close to her parents and her siblings she's also close to her friends um let's add like list friends um okay but this is good we're off to a good start okay all right so let's go ahead and copy this so basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to um take the the synthetic data that I'm already generating about these characters and use that as a launch point to get that interiority as well because the thing is is you need to know these things about a character in order to simulate their mind because if you if you have a list of say like this is what this person wants or thinks or believes that that dictates um like how they how they'll respond to the world um oh we should do personality personality and connections yeah okay so then we'll come back out here and do character simulation and we'll do prompt um uh we'll say characteristics and that will say traits because you don't want to say like character characteristics you'll say character traits okay so this will be good um yeah so we won't need so getting getting someone's first POV is good um because then because then what we'll do is you can you can get you can put in a scene or you can actually have a like a running run on um Consciousness like stream of Consciousness and that probably what we'll do is actually just translate um all of these povs or all these scenes into first person and so then we'll have one set of data that will be like the scene is happening but then we'll have another set of data that is like this is the character but what we'll need is to have like the characters traits so that way you can just have that as like the character's core Constitution um yeah okay all right well I'm gonna go ahead and pause it because this data will take a while to finish um and I'm also like branching out in different directions I don't want to get make this video too confusing all right we're at 588 so um got about 100 samples left we'll be back in a minute okay we are rapidly oops you don't need this um we are rapidly zooming in on the final product so it's going to be 699 or so 694 I think it just finished um there we go all right so you might be looking at like okay why like you just did this with prompts what's the what's the advantage so the advantage is that um because because I've got the the prompts built in and then I have a whole bunch of data showing the structure so I'm not trying to teach it anything new I'm just basically guaranteeing that it's going to follow the right format okay so first let's go ahead and we've got our scenes folder which is 1.8 megabytes well I guess 528 actual kilobytes 694 samples so we'll copy our scenes directory over to our character simulation um because hey you know we just generated this data it's super valuable um and then what we'll do is we will um do so we've got next scenes right so now let's open up generate next scenes um and this is going to be so for file in files OS Lister scenes we'll print out the scene and we'll do prompt next so prompt next is going to advance the plot so we'll say prompt next long detailed next scene um this this works relatively well sometimes it's a little too short sometimes not um but yeah um so let's see use your imagination to describe the following scene in great detail we want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment um let me actually well yeah uh okay I think this is all set so we'll come back here and do um let's see oh actually I know what I need to add do new ID um I think that's in here yeah generate next scene yup uuid scene okay so then we will hit play python generate next scene and so what this is going to do it's going to generate two scenes in sequence yep okay stretching his legs he walks over the stream and looks down oh this is great okay so this is generating synthetic data so that I have a very clear way of of telling the creating a structure where it says okay here's one thing here's the next thing and so what I'm doing now is I'm filling up in scene simulation there's next scenes and the file name is going to be identical so you have the first scene and then the next scene and they're all just going to be sequentially one after the other which will allow us to put whatever we want so here's the big Advantage is we're teaching it the structure that is the entire point of fine tuning is we're teaching it a pattern where it says okay given whatever input I give here advance the plot and so what I can do in the future is instead of having the original scene written by like a prompt or one shot it can be conglomerated by several things such as the character simulation that I'm about to work on okay so the character simulation we'll we'll we'll let the uh the scene simulation run in the background the character Sim um we'll do uh let's see first pause um okay so then we'll go to generate POV um here let's close some of these things because we're getting a little a little bit busy okay so generate POV um we do not need locations we can delete that um uh that's probably fine okay and actually here let's go ahead and open um scene simulation because generate next scene let me just copy a little bit of this okay whoops okay so we're going to print

CLEAR ESSAY:
