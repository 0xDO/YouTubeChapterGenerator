The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with a quick video um you might notice i'm trying a different microphone um the last video was a total disaster because uh the my blue yeti was either um either the microphone is dying or the cable was dying or something because the first time i recorded it there was no sound and the second time i recorded it the sound was still very low despite the gain being normal so anyways i'm using a cheaper more generic microphone it's got no fancy bells or whistles so i hope the sound is better but the point of the video today was that i wanted to do a little thing called theory of mind so let's ask gpt3 right and an academic explanation of theory of mind and then we'll do parentheses neuroscience so it'll just tell it like okay this is not this is not a psychology let's talk about it from the perspective of neuroscience so let's see what it says there we go perfect the theory of mind is a cognitive ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others and to understand that others have different mental states from oneself it is a fundamental ability for social cognition and communication the theory of mind is thought to be mediated by a network of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the temporoparietal junction these regions are thought to be important for self-awareness social cognition and communication the theory of mind is a important ability for social cognition and communication it is thought to be okay it's just repeating itself um all right so this is good uh let's see so the reason that i want to bring this up and try in context of like ai or whatever is because one thing that i noticed when working on artificial cognitive entities is that they don't know their own mind um and so you need to give them a sense of their own mind i'm working on another book for this it's called symphony of thought it'll this one will take a lot longer to work on because it's got all these different ideas and a lot of experimentation to do but i wanted to demonstrate that one gpt3 already knows conceptually what theory of mind is but does it actually have theory of mind so let's so this is an experiment i wanted to do i've been working on a gpt3 chatbot so okay so let's get this and we're going to say um so with that in mind we'll say um infer the contents of the minds of the user and eve from the following conversation okay so one way to test theory of mind actually here before we do that let's just say um how is theory theory of mind tested or examined scientifically and again this is like going to demonstrate um just how much gpt3 already knows wow good answer okay theory of mind can be tested or examined scientifically through behavioral tasks or experiments that measure an individual's ability to attribute mental states to others for example in the false belief task individuals are presented with a story in which a character has a false belief about an object's location the individual is then asked to predict where the character will look for the object oh that's good okay individuals with a theory of mind are able to correctly predict the character's behavior while those without a theory of mind are not so theory of mind is critical when it when you're trying to predict how other people are going to act because you're basically simulating their brain in your head right and so when um when you think about like okay humans are social animals this is what we mean is like if you've ever been caught up in gossip or manipulation or whatever part of anticipating what other people will do is remembering what they do and don't know but this is also why lying is really bad policy because people that are chronic liars or manipulators they have to keep track of many many different stories and many many versions of reality and the human brain can't do that too well and so that's why like honesty is the best policy really works because then you only have to keep track of one story the true story and you don't have to keep track of what's in other people's heads okay what is the relationship between theory of mind and autism so it um it asks this question without me um doing it so i'm not we're not interested in autism i just wanted to say like okay this is this is one way that we can do it okay so now let's take this and we're gonna invent our own theory of mind experiment okay so let's do this and we'll just demonstrate that gpt3 can um actually here we'll leave that in okay the following is a chat conversation conversation i know how to spell between a user and a life coach make inferences about the state of mind contents of of contents of mind emotions beliefs and and desires for each participant okay so um then we'll just say um eve's theory of mind let's see what it does um okay that's that's okay that's not exactly what i meant so um what uh let's see what is no uh let's see right a rigorous list of beliefs ideas and thoughts that may be in eve's mind okay so this is just kind of regurgitating what what it's seen above listening here and providing support okay so this is interesting it is inferring that um yeah okay that eve may also have ideas about how to help the user such as by listening it by being a listening ear and providing support um okay so it did infer that that's what eve wants to do so let's break this down a little bit further because i'm asking a really broad question um what kind of person is eve okay so it has it is inferred this that like eve is a life coach i mean i guess i said it's a life coach um between a user and let's remove this so user and eve so we let's not tell um let's just say okay the following is a conversation between user and eve so let's remove any any details and let's just coming in cold let's see what someone thinks about this or what eve is a very caring person who is always willing to help others she is a great listener and gives great advice okay this is this is cool so

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Theory of mind is a cognitive ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, and to understand that others have different mental states from oneself. It is a fundamental ability for social cognition and communication.

The theory of mind is thought to be mediated by a network of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior superior temporal sulcus, and the temporoparietal junction. These regions are thought to be important for self-awareness, social cognition, and communication.

The theory of mind is an important ability for social cognition and communication. It is thought to be important for predicting the behavior of others.

Theory of mind can be tested or examined scientifically through behavioral tasks or experiments that measure an individual's ability to attribute mental states to others. For example, in the false belief task, individuals are presented with a story in which a character has a false belief about an object's location. The individual is then asked to predict where the character will look for the object. Individuals with a theory of mind are able to correctly predict the character's behavior, while those without a theory of mind are not.

Theory of mind is critical when trying to predict how other people are going to act because it allows you to simulate their brain in your head. This is why honesty is the best policy, as it allows you to keep track of only one story (the true story) instead of many different versions of reality.

The relationship between theory of mind and autism is not well understood. However, some experts believe that individuals with autism may have difficulty understanding the mental states of others.
