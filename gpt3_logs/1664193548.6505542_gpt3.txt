The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: case might be a city and so then you have a sensor on it on it on a trash bin or something and it says hey come pick me up um that's a very basic use case now looking at a more advanced use case especially since we've got um large language models today large language models allow us to start to do work with natural language instructions and natural language contracts so one of the problems with AI up to this point is that you need very formal symbolic language if this then that you know uh very very strict representations as to what you will do sometimes going as far as just representing it as code right like I'm going to give you this piece of code you execute it because the piece of code is deterministic what I think is going to happen is as we as large language models become more familiar more robust uh more reliable we're going to start to see uh where natural language conversations happen and that is how you uh come to consensus so this is some this is going back to Tao one of the things that I talk to them about and this is in their white paper and on on their blogs too they have a Blog on Liam um I'll post a link to that real quick actually uh let's see pal medium there we go it's powchain.medium.com in case you can't see the uh the chat later on um anyways so what they do or what they're planning on doing I'm not sure quite how developed the technology is but they're getting they're working on getting funding um so they've they've got something um so what they're going to do is by having those conversations uh because this is how you arrive at consensus right is you get everyone they're having a conversation so this is the coolest part this is what I'm building up to you have a conversation about an issue that you care about right it could if you have if you have children you might be talking about you know participating in in a part of of Tau that deals with like the Parent-Teacher Association and the school board right and there might be other things that you don't care about right like you might not care about trash pickup or whatever um but as you have conversations on the Tau Network it will build a representation of you so that it can Advocate on your behalf even when you're not participating so this was something that was explored in that book I mentioned earlier liquid rain and I was just like okay cool like I agree that this is a great idea but it's not even possible right um but I disagree with myself now um this is what happens change your mind over time so what they call it is a world view capital W world view where over time they build up the Tau Network builds up a world view of you of every participant in it so that it can be a digital or virtual Avatar of you to represent your interests even when you're not there and so then what it can do is it can go have essentially virtual debates with every other entity every other world view in order to find the right solution so what is the big difference between consensus and democracy because it's not just voting right if it was just voting we've got plenty of systems that can do that the thing about consensus is that consensus requires everyone to work together to find new Solutions um which is like you have to reach reach out and be creative um because it's not just an up down vote like approve this measure or you know yes or no against this bill or vote for this person or that person that's democracy it's not voting consensus is a creative generative process where everyone comes together and part of consensus is you get every everything that everyone cares about and knows about you get all that on the table and so that's got to be stored in the network somewhere and then once you get all those concerns they start coming up with possible solutions and so the key thing about consensus is that you generate Solutions and possibilities and iterate over them until you come up with something that everyone can live with until you come up with something that is better than what you originally thought you'd end up with and that is the power of consensus and that is the power of embedding a consensus mechanism a natural language consensus mechanism in something like Tau so then you have a natural language or otherwise a mathematical representation of you your worldview your digital Avatar and it's going out there and advocating on your behalf and as these AI systems get more sophisticated over time they will then be able to be more creative and more generative out on the network without you participating coming with new Solutions and so another thing that's really interesting about this is because remember I said there's two components there's data and there's model right so there's going to be a model of you this is what I call an agent model so how they call it world view I call it an agent model so an agent model is just a representation of you your beliefs or not you but just a character because an agent model can be used for a robot it can be used for a dog but like I have an agent model of myself so like my agent model says I am human I am a white guy I wear glasses I know that I know a lot about Ai and writing that's my agent model but if you take a copy of that agent model from my head and put it onto a network there's other kinds of data right so those agent models are those World Views can be on the network but you can also continuously inject new scientific information or new ideas into that Network and all that data can then be used with other models to come up with new Solutions everyone approves of or disapproves of until until that's a until the negotiation comes up with a result now just because there's a debate doesn't mean that there has to be an answer or a decision made because with consensus you can decide we don't have enough information right now um that is a perfectly legitimate decision with consensus where you you could you say okay we decide not to do anything definitive right now because we don't know

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Case Network is a system that uses sensors to collect data and then uses large language models to analyze that data and find solutions to problems. The system is designed to be used by businesses, governments, and other organizations to find consensus on issues. The system builds up a representation of each participant in the network, called a "world view," and then uses those world views to find solutions to problems. The system is designed to be used by businesses, governments, and other organizations to find consensus on issues.
