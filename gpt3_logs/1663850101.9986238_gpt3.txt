0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:15:06.240,0:15:12.120
um so to make it a little bit more specific a
self-referential information system about the
0:15:12.120,0:15:23.340
entity um so like what kinds of agent models of
agent models are possible do they have to be I
0:15:24.540,0:15:30.120
um anyways so I just wanted to set the stage
my very next video will be about testing agent
0:15:30.120,0:15:37.860
models and seeing how that affects um the way
that uh and uh how that affects alignment now
0:15:37.860,0:15:45.600
before I let you go there is one other thing that
I wanted to um wanted to show you and this is this
0:15:45.600,0:15:52.800
is much more recent so 36 alarming Automation
and job statistics our robots and um let's go
0:15:52.800,0:15:59.820
away machines and AI coming for your job so this
is this is a uh more recent and it's from zippya
0:15:59.820,0:16:08.700
you know take it with a grain of salt um since
2000 at least 2600 or sorry 260 000 jobs have been
0:16:08.700,0:16:14.400
lost in the and the US due to automation so two
percent of the country's manufacturing Workforce
0:16:14.400,0:16:20.520
and they are only increasing exponentially again
take it with a grain of salt automation is also
0:16:20.520,0:16:26.460
predicted to create 58 million new jobs though
automation could eliminate in the result of 73
0:16:26.460,0:16:31.920
million jobs so we're at where the the the the
the yield curves to borrow a finance term have
0:16:31.920,0:16:37.980
inverted where yes automation is creating new
jobs but it's creating uh Automation and AI
0:16:37.980,0:16:44.640
ER creating fewer new jobs than it's creating
so a net loss of 15 million jobs that's a lot
0:16:45.720,0:16:52.200
um so uh the reason that I bring this up is
because my state of the industry video yesterday
0:16:53.340,0:17:00.420
um there was an article about how um uh AI art
is disrupting that industry and it's not just
0:17:00.420,0:17:09.180
from an artistic perspective there are countless
um uh graphic artists that you know could very
0:17:09.180,0:17:18.360
soon be facing um job loss or job change and you
know if if the net change is that a quarter you
0:17:18.360,0:17:22.560
know like yes there are some new jobs because now
there's going to be new jobs of people like you
0:17:22.560,0:17:28.800
know content creators and marketers and whoever
just using these tools great new jobs but then
