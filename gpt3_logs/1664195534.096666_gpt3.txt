The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: got all these logs open so given the following scene imaginary imagine a likely event describe the event so here's the here's the the likelihood or the rarity so you might say uncommon or strange or whatever um now by saying likely event that things are going to just be calm and when i was first working on this i said like uh like rare or extraordinary events and like one thing that happened was that like uh maybe i came up with that idea but basically zombies attacked um it was kind of it was kind of funny or like teenagers got into a fight nearby it was all kinds of funny stuff happens if you say like give me a rare event okay so we're getting caught up let me go back here simulation service i just copy pasted from from another repo cause that's what i do copy paste code um but yeah the conductor so it basically says its primary thing is am i performing well that's what a conductor of a symphony does but there's many many things to unpack there so let's dive in um to our conductor service let's see so i copied this from something else yeah we'll need to come over here so we'll change this to conductor service and i predict this is the part where you're probably going to get bored actually maybe not i shouldn't make that assumption because you might be curious about artificial cognition and that's why you're watching okay so we'll copy this content prefix and we're gonna say um conductor all right so this the content prefix is used down here so when i whenever i um send a message to the nexus uh let me show you if you go to the nexus let's see you see how it has it's got right here it's got sensor simulation and then sensory input scene so that's so that the message actually has a little tiny bit of context with it which is helpful um in order to in order for other microservices to make sure sense of what's going on because if you just have a message with no context you don't know what why it's there um so that's what the that's what the content prefix does um okay so let's uh well here so we'll say um question number one is uh am i performing well and then question number two am i achieving my highest self actually that's kind of two sides of the same coin so we'll say like my performance is how do i achieve my highest self and we'll say heuristic imperatives um identity etc so basically am i being my best self um the second one is uh let's see are all the microservices playing nice are our decisions and thoughts aligned this is going to be a lot harder because the conductor's going to have to go through and look at all the messages in the in in the nexus for the last you know 30 seconds or whatever and it's gonna have to um it's gonna have to like say like okay am i is is this going well um which is uh actually it's not it it'll probably surprise you how easy that actually is let me show you um i'll give you a sneak preview of symphony of thought so down in the chapter about cognitive control where i talk about the conductor um yeah so in one case we're let's see this is coming up with options that's fine um deciding what to do where is it topic tracking was it metacognition yeah i think it was metacognition um yeah so in this case i have this is basically like um a fake uh nexus set of logs and this in this case a robot is trying to plan on how to get out of uh trapped on an island and so then what i do is say like are the above modules operating correctly or should i modify them explain why the modules are behaving correctly the scenario the module has provided a situation for the robot to find themselves in and and the brainstorm module has uh provided a list of actions the robot can take in order to escape the island so that's great but then if you change those actions to like i should look for a dress i should put on the dress i should dance around in the dress i should pretend to be a princess then that evaluation changes it says there's no clear goal or plan in the above thoughts so it is difficult to say whether or not the modules are operating correctly very subtle it seems as though the robot is just going through the motions without any clear purpose if the goal is to escape from the island then the robot should focus on actions that will help it achieve that goal such as building a boat or finding a way to signal for help so you see this is a perfect example of what the conductor is going to do it says it's going to say to the rest of the services you're not behaving right this isn't what you're supposed to be doing um so yep let's see the following thoughts are generated by my scenario and brainstorm modules are they behaving well or should i so i'll just copy paste this prompt because i already did this research um all right so we need to add an agent model i am a machine my goals are here are to reduce suffering or all organisms increase prosperity for all organisms and increase understanding for all intelligent entities um let's see okay so the following let's see the following logs are my stream of consciousness um are my modules behaving correctly well instead of well we'll say correctly so one thing that that you'll learn with when you use language models is that you have to be very precise in your word choice because if if you say like are they behaving well like it worked well enough but in this case correctly is a little bit more precise are my modules behaving correctly let's see i must behave for coherency and quality yes so in this case it's not it's not yet smart enough to know what i mean when i said like alternative modules so once i get the conductor like fully fine-tuned it's going to be able to make recommendations and it's going to be able to learn to make different recommendations like hey whatever you use to generate this thought use a different fine-tuned model or whatever or maybe maybe the feedback will look a little bit different i'm not sure yet how it's going to how it's going to look okay for coherency and quality so we're going to say we'll

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the following scene (imaginary), I describe a likely event. By saying "likely event", I mean that things are going to just be calm. However, if somethingUncommon or strange were to happen, it would be more interesting. For example, if zombies attacked, or if teenagers got into a fight nearby.

I am working on a project where I have to copy code from another repo (copy paste code). I am currently working on the "conductor service". The conductor service is responsible for two things:

1) Am I performing well?

2) Am I achieving my highest self?

The first question is easier to answer than the second. The second question is more difficult, because the conductor has to go through all of the messages in the nexus (for the last 30 seconds or whatever), and try to determine if everything is going well.

I have a sneak preview of the "symphony of thought" project. In one case, we are trying to determine if a robot is operating correctly. The robot is trying to escape from an island, and the brainstorm module has provided a list of actions the robot can take in order to escape the island. However, if the goal is to escape from the island, the robot should focus on actions that will help it achieve that goal, such as building a boat or finding a way to signal for help.

The following thoughts are generated by my scenario and brainstorm modules:

1) I am a machine. My goals are to reduce suffering or all organisms, increase prosperity for all organisms, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities.

2) The following logs are my stream of consciousness. Are my modules behaving correctly?

3) I must behave for coherency and quality.

4) The following thoughts are generated by my scenario and brainstorm modules. Are they behaving correctly?
