The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: enough and so instead we're going to launch a you know investigation a six month long investigation to gather more information or do some experiments or something right and that's what you can do with consensus one other thing that I um uh talked about when I spoke with uh Tau the some of the folks from Tao earlier was that um consensus is something that it the most familiar model that people have with consensus is scientific instances and so the the way that things work with the scientific Community is that one you have to be a valid player right you have to have the university backing you have to be accredited or otherwise graduated right you have to have a PhD or MD or whatever so there's certain levels of credentials um that you have to have or you can even participate in scientific consensus now um in the book uh consensus through conversation um which is one of the the best resources to understand consensus there's nothing wrong with that um it is a little bit gatekeeping it is a little bit elitism but the reason for that is because you have to decide who belongs in the discussion for consensus well for science that works you want scientists to be participating in scientific consensus you want um you want you know uh scientists with their reputations intact with valid you know credentials so that you know that they can participate but what happens when you're trying to do consensus for everyone in a city or everyone in a nation or everyone on the whole planet right because we have to you know we're thinking long term here where it's like hey what how do we do consensus for eight billion people or 10 billion people or however many billions of people we're going to have in the future and so then you have to be allowed to participate in consensus whether or not you're qualified and so that means your needs right you like your basic human needs your wants your desires your opinions need to carry weight regardless of whether you understand consensus and so this is where a natural language interface with it makes sense and this is so I'm tying it all back to distributed AI because if all you can do is just you know have a chat interface whether it's text or voice where you can interact with the system and it'll build up your worldview and then it can go and Advocate on your behalf with what you need and want in life then that is a fundamentally different uh kind of government that might be possible time will tell so let's see um we've had a couple other people vote for other some some other topic but no one has said in chat what they want the other topic to be so if there's something else you'll have me to talk about then like let me know in the chat I think there's at least two people um who want alternative topics so but that that's my Spiel as I understand the direction of distributed AI as it pertains to distributed autonomous organizations right now so I'll take a drink of water and see if anyone has any requests for alternative topics but also we're already 40 minutes in so this time has gone by fast so I've only got about 20 minutes left because I usually try and keep these down to an hour um before I run out of steam going once going twice Bueller I'm probably dating myself when I use that reference Bueller anybody all right the Bueller School all right AI life AI research lab says AGI okay cool let's talk about AGI for a minute or maybe last 20 minutes who knows let's see any plan to start a bloom 176 form for fine tuning um yes Jordan I would love to do that and I think um I think I think Chris on the server wants to do that too um so but let's focus CGI for a little bit um actually No Angel Baby Says like yeah he wants to do that too okay um I guess the short answer for creating a balloon form from petals um I mean why not yeah let's see about when you predict when we start seeing the suing against miles like stable diffusion for reasons like copyright infringement ah now that's an interesting thing okay so topics we'll talk about um setting up a swarm um using something like pedals we'll talk about AGI and then we'll talk about the legality of stable diffusion and and AI art AI Art Is Hot Topic Okay so um the shortest topic that was brought up is um I am not personally planning on setting up a an open source swarm just yet however um I excuse me I definitely support anyone else who wants to um so yeah that's that's about all I got to say on that um I think that it's coming fast so as a technologist this is one thing is while I am participating in Cutting Edge research as a technologist as an I.T professional I am I like cringe away from first generation first iteration things because I know that they're fragile and that they break and so this is like a weird dichotomy this is a this is a pro this is a Dave problem in my own head on the one hand I always want to be playing with the most Cutting Edge things but on the other hand from my day job I know that playing with Cutting Edge things invites disaster right like for my day job I'm like let's stick with something that's tried and true and stable because you know what I've had way way too many late nights and you know like there was one time that uh this was this was uh about eight years ago where like we released a patch right we updated a bunch of servers and then they started um they started crashing and then it took like eight hours of Investigation to figure out that it was a firmware incompatibility and then the next four hours patching everything again and this was all on a Sunday um so it's like I am so phobic about those things from those experiences but then on the other hand I'm like yeah let's try everything new um so this is just like my own like I'm not going to say schizophrenia I'm not schizophrenic and I don't want to uh invalidate or or uh make fun of people who do struggle with schizophrenia I've known people that struggled with schizophrenia it is soul-crushing for their friends and family but for me it's

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In his video, David Shapiro discusses the idea of using distributed AI to create a more democratic form of government. He argues that the most familiar model of consensus is the scientific method, which can be elitist and exclusive. However, he suggests that a natural language interface could allow everyone's needs and wants to be heard and advocated for, regardless of qualifications.

Shapiro then goes on to discuss the possibility of setting up a swarm using something like pedals, as well as the legality of stable diffusion and AI art.

In conclusion, Shapiro acknowledges that while he is not personally planning on setting up an open source swarm just yet, he is definitely supportive of anyone who wants to.
