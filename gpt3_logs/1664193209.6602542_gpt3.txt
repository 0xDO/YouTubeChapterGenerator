The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: later bye and it didn't actually break so there's still a little bit of trouble with the with the scene having some forward momentum but this took me a couple hours to do um and the idea is that you're kind of separating out the character threads from the scene and the plot so for anyone who has studied um the art of story writing there's three primary components there's setting uh character and plot so setting is the world that's where it's happening character that's the people and plot is the events what's happening around it so those are the three primary ingredients and so i figured if you run each of those as an individual simulation it might work so far it's it's yeah meh um all right but so we've got an example here so let me just do cls there we go python compile story open ai is not defined what do you mean it's not defined all right so let me show you what i was working on so basically the idea is you run the simulation and then you end up with a whole bunch of log files and as i showed you the logs are so the gpt3 logs these are the raw log files here and then the logs are here where it's just this is the actual like story where it's stored um so here's an example of what it looks like um actually here i'll save this as a backup story backup um so this is this was a previous iteration i think oh yeah this is the one where it got bombed so you can check it'll be story underscore backup.txt where you can see it like it got bombed and they're all sad and crying but they're also dead at the same time so it's a little little loopy wasn't quite there um and there's all there's also all kinds of other little things of repetition so you see where it says like ahmed twice um so i'm working on fixing those little bugs and stuff this is the problem when you get recursive stuff you see it jane smith jane smith jane smith minor problems anyways so the compile story what this does is it takes all the logs compiles them together like this but then what it does is it breaks it up into into each recursive chunk and it writes it as actual prose and it's actually not too bad at that so let me show you where i've gotten so far with that so python compile story oh whoops i opened it and then forgot to add open ai sorry hold on import open ai and then i think from time import time and sleep i think that's all i need to add and it should be good to go yeah okay so this should take just a second and basically what it's doing is it's reading those logs and then it's going to convert them to pros here you go so you see where it's um it's giving you some some some actual pros moving out of the city and it's it's being repetitive again yeah well of course the source material was repetitive so no surprise there um yep there's no point in getting too far ahead of ourselves yeah okay so then if we come back here and we do come to the story so here we've actually got some got some some some pros you know the coffee shop is cozy and inviting um with a cozy fireplace and comfortable chairs this is obviously not the best this is not like particularly compelling right this is not um why is my mind blanking i cannot think of a single famous author right now um yeah okay my brain is clearly off anyways this is kind of like run-of-the-mill stuff so it needs it still needs a little bit of work but the idea is here where it's there's kind of this background simulation that's running the environment and then there's other individual simulations running the characters um so this is auto muse three i'm gonna keep working on this uh well i'm not gonna make any promises what i what usually happens is i get these things to a certain point and then i abandon them because i come back a few months later and do something far more sophisticated so no promises but this is a this is an interesting direction to go in so i think that's all for today um yeah thanks for watching talk to you later bye

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro discusses his latest project: a story writing simulator that runs various simulations in order to generate a story. He demonstrates how the simulator works and how it produces a story. Although the story is not particularly compelling at this stage, Shapiro believes that this is a promising direction for story writing.
