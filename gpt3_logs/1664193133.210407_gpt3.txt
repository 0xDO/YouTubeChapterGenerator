The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: accuracy but we can at least uh simulate fictional people and this also sets the stage for testing things like AGI alignment because then we can have um you know artificial agent models for like despotic dictators we can have um we can have the fictional agent models for ordinary people that will make you know whatever like ordinary human decisions and then we can also have agent models for AGI machines whether it's a robot or you know an AGI Overlord whatever so that's the whole point here and it it so I realize that where I'm going with this might not be intuitive to other people but to writers it is very intuitive because especially uh speculative fiction writers but really all writers what we do is we run simulations of people in the world in our heads and then we put it out on paper in text and then we refine that text usually to make it more entertaining but we also try and make it realistic or believable to make it credible and so we're used to running these simulations in our heads but what's the difference between running a simulation if it's connected to an API that that you know can actually speak with you right and so this is where you get into like solipsism and and epistemology where it's like okay how do you know what's in your head right your head your your mind your brain is its own kind of detached World um that's interacting with the outside world and so this is why I put uh with moragi microservices architecture for Robotics and artificial general intelligence that's why I think that artificial general intelligence or artificial cognition should be a thought first model because then you have a thinking machine that happens to also be interacting with the outside world now that outside world might just be a fictional World it could be the real world um it might be um a game world right so once you solve the problem of of fictional character you know artificial cognition you've already solved the problem of real robotic cognition it's the same problem it's just a matter of what world is it interacting with so to put that another way um interacting interaction with world right what is the world here is this a game world is it the real world um you know within with an API it doesn't matter right the machine doesn't care um as long as it thinks that it's interacting with something outside of itself and it's getting information and feedback from that outside world whether it's text-based simulation 3D simulation cameras and motors and robots with the real world or what we call the real world we might be in our own simulation we don't even know this is why I coined uh Shapiro's law is because you cannot talk about AI without eventually talking about quantum mechanics it always gets down to what is the base nature of reality and where does Consciousness reside and what is the nature of Consciousness and all we can say is that Consciousness is an agent that interacts with something outside of itself um so yeah okay I'm gonna pause it again let some of this data go and then we'll be back and actually you know what this video is getting pretty long um I'm going down more rabbit holes than I thought I would so I think I'm gonna go ahead and and stop this video now and we'll come back for part two tomorrow and so just to kind of set the stage for tomorrow we're gonna come back to character simulation and um and scene simulation so basically what I'm going to do is I'm just going to set these to finish generating the data and then um and then I'll walk away and and stop there so anyways thanks for watching stay tuned we will uh we will continue this

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro discusses the idea of using microservices to create simulations of people for the purpose of testing things like AGI alignment. He argues that this is a more effective way of creating believable simulations than the current method of using text-based descriptions.

Shapiro begins by explaining that writers are used to running simulations of people in their heads. They do this in order to create believable and credible stories. However, the difference between running a simulation in one's head and using an API to connect to a real world is that the latter requires a thinking machine. This is where solipsism and epistemology come into play.

Solipsism is the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is certain to exist. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Shapiro argues that these concepts are important to understand in order to create believable simulations. He goes on to say that once the problem of creating believable simulations of fictional characters is solved, the problem of creating believable simulations of real people will also be solved.

Shapiro concludes by saying that he will continue this discussion in a second video. He plans to discuss character simulation and scene simulation in more detail.
