TRANSCRIPT: what was money used what money what was money used before paper money before paper money people use commodities like gold or silver how did people carry around gold or silver i wonder if this is too basic um user why did why did we stop using gold okay so it's it's kind of breaking it down um this might be this might have dumbed it down too much because i really want him to provide like to focus on those those thorough academic responses um the user is yeah because basically by adding this um it's really simplified it which is not necessarily a bad thing right maybe what i'll do is i'll save this as a separate prompt just so that way you can play with it yourself prompt and i'll just underscore child the user is [Music] very smart so tim provides university level explanations okay so let's try this okay so by changing by changing it to like expert level so like let's say you wanted to commercialize this bot um you can have different prompts to choose like what level you know you're at so hey tim can you tell me about the history of money absolutely money is a human invention and its history is fascinating the first known use of money was in ancient china around 3000 bc how did they use it money was originally used as a form of barter trade goods and services etcetera that makes sense but how did money become was it what it is today oh this is great this is like the kind of question i would have asked as a kid over time people would have started using money as a way to buy buy and sell goods and services they would use coins or pieces of paper to represent money and eventually banks were created good good good um so let me change this um what was the first bank because that's like a supernatural follow-up question the first bank was created in italy in the 14th century um okay great you slap a voice interface on this it's good um all right i'm really satisfied with this let's um as a child so they ask many clarifying questions that's fine let's clean this up whoops topic okay um i think we're ready to let this run um cd what is this tutor chat bot python what is the name of it tutor chat bot synthesize convos right oh and i need the conversations folder convos and i also need the gpt3 logs folder because i save everything just in case it blows up because i want to go back and see what what it actually did gbt3 logs okay i think we're going to let this run i'll pause the video again and um we'll uh we're basically done this is the hard part once you get all the setup the rest is automatic but let's make sure that this works python oh darn my brain is not fully online synthesize synthesize there we go make sure this works history of rome let's see what kind of conversation it generates hey eve why did it say eve hang on something is amiss here did i forget to update the uh no eve is not mentioned anywhere here i'm in the right yeah tutor chatbot did i have a dumb what is going on here okay there's there's the prompt tim hey tim see this is why i test things um synthesize convos i wonder if it's in the script it's got to be it's got to be somewhere there it is okay found it gotta update your whole script um okay let me come in here and delete these well let's just take a quick look at them okay so the the the initial name was wrong that's not that big a deal um absolutely have you checked out liberty's history from yeah let's go right to graduate school level okay well i guess maybe that's not graduate school level but at least university level it's a great starting point yeah i read that one but i'm looking for something a little more in depth oh this is interesting because it actually asked for a resource you might want to try tacitus's annals of imperial rome this is great um okay so this is a good librarian bot too my girlfriend would be proud um okay so let me i think that i fixed it i found the problem this is a big this is what happens when you uh copy paste your code by the way um you sometimes you sometimes get little aberrations like that okay let's make sure this works and then we will let it go history of rome and then there we go hey tim i'm wondering if you could help out with that uh fall of the roman empire yes exactly can you explain what happened to me excellent okay so this script will do it an iteration of four times it'll go through each topic once um with this prompt uh yeah cool all right let me hit pause and then we'll come back when this is done we'll be ready to fine tune and test it okay it's almost done um generating samples uh we're at 155 and uh you can hear my southern accent coming out oh man i had such a thick southern accent when i was little 100 yep 100 is spelled h-u-n-n-e-r-t in the south um anyways uh let's see so i had some ideas um well first i wanted to explain why i focused on curiosity uh conventional education says that children are little receptacles that you should just cram stuff into my first year of school was at a montessori school which montessori the theory goes that children should have self-directed education and it should be more unstructured and kind of open-ended because when a child is allowed to engage with their own curiosity they're going to put in way more energy montessori schools have proven benefits i don't know why they haven't caught on actually no i do is because we're obsessed with testing and grading because we want to you know we want to measure how effective something is right this is this is neoliberalism at play anyways um in the long run longevity studies show that things like montessori school and um self-directed learning to a certain extent with some asterisks tend to do better because as i've mentioned in other videos western education and eastern education for that matter is really good at educating curiosity out of students however if you respond to a child's curiosity they're going to put in lots of their own energy in fact they're going to put in more of their own energy and you don't have to you don't have to
