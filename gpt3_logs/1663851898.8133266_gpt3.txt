0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:01:16.320,1:01:22.560
granted a huge chunk of this was waiting um
so let me do a quick refresh here and let
1:01:22.560,1:01:31.200
me show you what the final result is um
whoops scroll down um scripts okay so um
1:01:32.720,1:01:40.960
oh let's come up with a random premise for a
story uh actually here my creativity is offline
1:01:40.960,1:01:49.280
so let me just go back up here write a premise
for um oh let's combine it so we have an anime
1:01:49.840,1:01:57.680
um an anime mystery and a high fantasy so let's
do write a premise for a high fantasy anime movie
1:01:58.880,1:02:09.200
write a detailed premise uh let's go brainstorm
okay in a world of swords and sorcery a young
1:02:09.200,1:02:14.160
girl named lily is thrust into a quest to save her
kingdom from a powerful evil sorcerer okay great
1:02:14.880,1:02:24.400
okay we've got a premise so let's oops clear that
out in a world of swords and sorcery and then the
1:02:24.400,1:02:30.560
um the fine tuning data adds this uh this script
so that tells it that the the premise is done
1:02:31.200,1:02:38.720
so we'll go down to scripts and we'll change this
to 0.5 and here we go let's see what happens it
1:02:38.720,1:02:44.240
might timeout because it does often take a little
bit of extra time to load a fine-tuned model
1:02:46.080,1:02:51.840
but we should be just about done and to
prove it let me go back here and show you
1:02:53.120,1:03:00.000
outline generators so started three hours ago
um yeah so three hours ago that's about how long
1:03:00.000,1:03:07.280
i've been working on this and we will do a final
commit and i'll do a final push yep please try
1:03:07.280,1:03:13.360
again shortly actually i'm not changing anything
so we'll just do ahead get status so remember i
1:03:13.360,1:03:23.600
started this video with um with just doing this
get the initial commit get add all get commit
1:03:25.440,1:03:32.080
am final commit and you can go check on
the um the commits yourself if you want get
1:03:32.080,1:03:39.120
push okay so this code is now updated and online
i'm probably also going to rename it from outline
1:03:39.120,1:03:44.960
generator because this has actually became a
script generator um why did it name it that
1:03:46.160,1:03:53.040
oh i probably accidentally copy pasted that
didn't i that shouldn't be there cof jsonl
