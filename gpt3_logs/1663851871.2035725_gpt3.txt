0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.320,0:00:06.000
hey everyone david shapiro here with a new kind
of video i'm going to try i've had this idea
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.280
for a while i've had this idea of doing a working
session and what i mean by that is i'm just going
0:00:11.280,0:00:16.160
to walk you through my entire process sometimes
people don't really believe me when i tell them
0:00:16.160,0:00:20.640
how fast i work or how easy this stuff is say you
know what i'm just going to record it end to end
0:00:21.520,0:00:29.600
and here's the project today someone said nicevid
so this is my co-writing flash fiction with gpt3
0:00:29.600,0:00:34.960
let me zoom in a little bit um he says nicevid
and the character dialog one i'm curious if you've
0:00:34.960,0:00:40.720
tried using gpt3 to generate a high level logical
plot summary where you prompt for a structure for
0:00:40.720,0:00:46.880
a structure like setup incident an inciting
incident midpoint false high etc etc in my
0:00:46.880,0:00:51.360
experiments it is too extensive prompt chaining
perhaps that's because it's more complex task
0:00:51.360,0:00:55.760
i say i tried that with my auto muse project and
it was not great at it however this is something
0:00:55.760,0:01:00.960
that could be fine-tuned so that gave me an idea
let me do an outline generator so i just created
0:01:00.960,0:01:10.880
this repo here is the repo here um and uh i've
added a couple files i just added my api key
0:01:12.000,0:01:18.400
and and a boilerplate thing so let me just
show you cd outline generator get status
0:01:19.200,0:01:30.560
get add git commit am initial commit get push
okay so you will see i just did i just did a push
0:01:31.600,0:01:37.520
there's only a handful of files in here let's
get started okay so the first thing to do with
0:01:37.520,0:01:44.960
this is playground let's go to text davinci o2 so
the very first thing let me zoom back in here is
0:01:47.280,0:01:51.280
uh we need some raw data to work with so we're
going to synthesize some data so the first
0:01:51.280,0:02:00.000
thing is let's just right off the cuff let's
see if this prompt works write a detailed um
0:02:01.600,0:02:13.920
uh no not right imagine no brainstorm there we go
brainstorm a plot synopsis for a random story um
0:02:16.000,0:02:24.720
let's say detailed plot synopsis um and let's
just see what that does the town of shepherd's
