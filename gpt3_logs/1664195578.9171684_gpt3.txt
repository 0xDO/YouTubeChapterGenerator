TRANSCRIPT: mills argues that illegal immigration is not inherently wrong or unethical mills points out that if most people were in a situation where their children were starving and they had a chance to get to the us they would take it regardless of the legal consequences therefore mills concludes that we must find a border policy that treats migrants with empathy and respect this is a compelling argument that highlights the human side of illegal immigration now that's still really hot mills effectively uses hypothetical situations to illustrate her point that most people would do whatever it takes to get their families to safety however the argument does not address some of the more practical concerns around illegal immigration such as national security overall this is a thought-provoking piece that challenges readers to consider the issue from a different perspective i would say that is a phenomenal opening paragraph however let me show you how long this is in comparison and part of the reason that it's shorter is because we're using text davinci o2 so text davinci o2 is fine-tuned on on on the instruct series data so it's basically saying okay i'm going to put out you know one sentence a couple paragraphs sometimes you get run on stuff but with davinci o2 its output is generally very short especially compared to some other ones so this is this is what gpt3 put out and then this was what a professional wrote i don't know if anna wrote it or if um if a student wrote it but you see like okay so we've got um let's see 906 character response versus 5800 character response so we're not quite there but the quality of this response phenomenal right this this i would say like um the construction of this it is very obvious that someone is responding that this author is responding directly to this essay whereas you say like you know the the response title was contested territory okay that's not even the same title right in recent years like someone is just kind of summarizing it um but honestly uh this i don't i don't think that this is as good of a of an opening because someone is like whoever wrote this they're not actually saying that this is what anna mills claims there's just stating this is a fact and so it's not clear that this is actually a critical response just from the get-go um so that's my personal opinion i'm not an expert in this this is just i'm reading this and if this was an art like if i saw this as like a blog and someone was like you know critiquing someone else's blog i'd be like what are you who are you like contested territory okay i would search for contested territory like is that what you're responding to um the second paragraph seems seems spot-on uh mills questions the ethics of enforcing immigration laws that was you know gpt-3 picked up on that as well um while the essay argues for empathy it limits the scope of its argument to from offering comprehensive vision okay so we've got all the different components um so for the opening paragraph it seems like if we just use this whole thing that's fine but what i'm wondering is if we can break it up into sections so first let's just copy this prompt down because it worked so we'll do essay summary and critical assessment um okay so we'll save this as prompt01 so we'll use this to generate the opening paragraph let's run it again just to see if it produces something similar so i'm guilty of this sometimes like i see one good output i'm like oh it's good um this it's almost identical okay yeah so the output is darn near identical let's turn up the temperature just to see if it gets really weird um so one thing is that um the quality of the instructions you know you see like there's a whole paragraph of instructions um whoops that actually can sometimes help sometimes if the instructions are not clear or if you're trying to do too many things it'll get confused okay so let's see our anna mills um challenges the morality yeah um she appeals to the reader's empathy asking to them to imagine strengths is delight in its emotional appeal and examine examination moral implications yeah okay so we've got that um but because we so there's a few there's a few like universal rules right um so what we want to do is break it down into smaller parts because um you know i think we do have weakness oh nope it didn't address the weaknesses so here's what i typically do when i want to deconstruct something um is i'll break it down into smaller and smaller parts um and so what i'll do is let's um well here let me make sure i've got a copy of the instructions nah no okay we got the instructions here and let's close that we don't need that um here's where i deconstructed it i actually don't like that let me close that i made a mess of it don't need that okay we'll get back to the script once we do some prompt engineering um yes so uh the key ideas including the main claim key reasons counter arguments rebuttals and limits all right let me now copy all this into a new prompt and all we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna pare this down so we want to summarize well here i'll borrow the same language that annie is so um we'll say write write a summary of the following essay um uh while focusing on focusing on the counter arguments rebuttals and limits assess the strengths and weaknesses of the argument okay so now let's take this and we're going to um assessment of strengths and weaknesses and if it's not apparent yet what i'm doing oh here let's just grab this hey yeah we can grab the whole thing and then we'll go grab the oops i closed it didn't i go back here so by breaking it down into smaller parts i'm basically going to say okay write each section separately so let's see what this does let's see if this works it might not let's turn this back down to 0.7 and here we go so this is this is a little bit better um the essays weakness is that it does not offer any specific solutions to the problems the author admits that open borders would be dangerous

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Anna Mills argues that illegal immigration is not inherently wrong or unethical. Mills points out that if most people were in a situation where their children were starving and they had a chance to get to the United States, they would take it regardless of the legal consequences. Therefore, Mills concludes that we must find a border policy that treats migrants with empathy and respect.

This is a compelling argument that highlights the human side of illegal immigration. Mills effectively uses hypothetical situations to illustrate her point that most people would do whatever it takes to get their families to safety. However, the argument does not address some of the more practical concerns around illegal immigration, such as national security. Overall, this is a thought-provoking piece that challenges readers to consider the issue from a different perspective.
