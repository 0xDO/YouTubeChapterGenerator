0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:25:39.060,0:25:44.040
can teach your body to make that protein or give
you the right stem cells to make that protein
0:25:44.040,0:25:50.040
or to fix that protein and this I mean again
the number of things that this unlocks like we
0:25:50.040,0:25:54.480
might have a therapy to prevent Alzheimer's right
because Alzheimer's is a protein problem where you
0:25:54.480,0:25:59.520
have plaques that accumulate because they're not
cleaned up properly okay we can probably fix that
0:26:00.420,0:26:10.800
um same thing with pretty much all heart disease
all cancer uh you know and gosh I mean well you
0:26:10.800,0:26:17.820
know you talk to a microbiologist and like pretty
much all disease comes down to uh misfolding
0:26:17.820,0:26:25.080
proteins um or or you know designing proteins that
do particular things and that includes immunology
0:26:25.080,0:26:32.280
and um and allergies right food intolerances
what if you have Crohn's disease or IBS and and
0:26:32.280,0:26:37.500
um you know leaky gut syndrome or whatever and
it's like oh we just need to give your uh give
0:26:37.500,0:26:43.620
your intestines what is it epithelial cells like
epithelial cells that can that can produce the
0:26:43.620,0:26:49.020
right enzyme to digest that so then suddenly you
don't have any chronic inflammatory issues right
0:26:50.220,0:26:54.300
um again these are all things that that I
see are within the realm of possibility I
0:26:54.300,0:27:01.200
would not be surprised if we see more and more
announcements like this um in 2023 all right so
0:27:01.200,0:27:07.560
finally I've talked a lot about about you know VC
and investment because here's the thing you always
0:27:07.560,0:27:12.780
always always see like scientists you know have
unlocked this potential and then nothing comes of
0:27:12.780,0:27:20.220
it why it's so frustrating right where you know
in theory something is is scientifically proven
0:27:21.240,0:27:28.080
um to work or demonstrated the difference is
from Theory to commercial application it has
0:27:28.080,0:27:33.960
to be financially viable and it also has to pass
muster for a lot of regulatory bodies like the FDA
0:27:34.680,0:27:43.320
um so the reason that I'm bringing up this is
because chat GPT super popular this is like
0:27:43.320,0:27:49.320
this is like a watershed moment for people to
invest in AI remember in my last video if you
0:27:49.320,0:27:56.220
watched it about it was just about GPT chat
GPT um was that it's it kind of proves that
0:27:56.220,0:28:00.660
it's possible Right it brings it front and
center and so then what you have is you have
0:28:00.660,0:28:05.940
a lot of fomo fear of missing out and so then
everyone and their brother who has any money is
0:28:05.940,0:28:11.400
like hey you know Facebook is going the way of
the dinosaurs even Google might be in trouble
0:28:12.420,0:28:15.900
um so they're pulling their money out of those
Tech Giants and they're going to be looking for
0:28:15.900,0:28:21.360
startups right they're going to be looking to the
Horizon saying okay who's doing good stuff with AI
0:28:22.200,0:28:27.660
and so this was uh particularly this year was
a watershed moment and so what we're going to
0:28:27.660,0:28:33.360
see in 2023 is the next that we're basically
seeing the beginning of the next.com Revolution
0:28:33.360,0:28:38.760
this is the AI Revolution where everyone and
their brother is going to be doing AI startups
0:28:39.660,0:28:43.320
um and there's going to be billions and
billions of dollars going around you're
0:28:43.320,0:28:47.760
going to see spectacular collapses you're
going to see mergers and Acquisitions
0:28:48.600,0:28:54.240
um the big players are gonna are gonna vacuum
them up right you know Google Microsoft IBM
0:28:55.260,0:29:02.400
um and and others um probably Honeywell GE
all of the big tech companies Raytheon they're
0:29:02.400,0:29:06.300
going to be they're going to be buying
up AI companies startups left and right
0:29:06.840,0:29:12.660
and in the meantime um there all the speculation
is going to be out there again you might be
0:29:12.660,0:29:17.880
thinking so what what has this change for me
well one thing that it might change for you is
0:29:18.600,0:29:27.240
um the the thing that's going to be impacted
the most is uh is the nature of work so you know
0:29:27.240,0:29:33.420
a lot of folks myself included have have long
said AI is going to you know destroy all jobs
0:29:35.040,0:29:41.460
um and there there is a rising um there is a
rising like uh chorus calling for like a four
0:29:41.460,0:29:46.860
day work week or a three-day work week one of
the reasons that that will happen is is because
