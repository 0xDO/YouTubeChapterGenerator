The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: good morning everybody david shapiro here for another video we are going to be doing an acog i've been talking about it for a while um this is not my first rodeo um i've actually written um a book about this and um basically over the last year since i um started working on that book i published it in what august so it's been about nine months since i published that book a year since i really was working on it um and i've been continuing to refine the process so let's let me just show you um what i'm talking about what do i mean by artificial cognitive entity acog or natural language cognitive architecture so i've got my book available online here this is the diagram let me zoom out a little bit so you can see it okay so this is it's composed of two loops there's the outer loop which deals with input and output that's interacting with the world so this is going to be the loop that controls like a robot or a voice or whatever microphone voice motors that sort of stuff and then there's the inner loop which deals with the mind and then the thing that links them is a shared database so this is really complicated a simpler way of representing it is this where you've got the inner loop which is thoughts planning memories etc then you've got the nexus which is the stream of consciousness or the shared database so functionally like okay say nexus that sounds complicated i say stream of consciousness that sounds complicated but functionally it's super simple um it's literally just a list of logs of of memories thoughts whatever um and they can all be represented in natural language so this is an example of the nexus right here this repo is not public but we're going to build a public one i have no idea how far i'm going to get in this video there's going to be multiple parts anyways so it's available natural language cognitive architecture i've got a whole book about how i came up with this there are lots and lots of diagrams about how everything works it's 100 free um and i've got all sorts of ideas about how how to build a consciousness how to build a an artificial consciousness so today all we're going to be focusing on is the inner loop and um and the nexus or the the shared database or the stream of consciousness i say nexus because it's two syllables it's easier to say um shared database is a little bit more concrete in terms of what it is um yeah so that's what we're doing um so this is the most basic architecture though and before we get started i wanted to actually talk about neuroscience so that way you kind of understand where i'm coming from and actually i forgot to grab the books before i started the video so let me go grab those books and i will talk to you about them as i'm talking about these architectures okay so i'm back with a stack of books and let me see if i can make this window bigger while i'm telling you about this does that work okay cool i think that worked um i'll leave that up so that i can see what's going on um yes it's recording okay so neuroscience books i started reading the telltale brain by vs ramachandran the telltale brain is a book about looking for what makes human brains distinctive in the animal kingdom um this book is phenomenal uh vs ramachandran is a great storyteller which which um he can he doesn't just like give you the facts like this part of the brain does this um because that's really dry but also it doesn't tell you what it means um he doesn't tell you the like if you just if you just tell the facts that doesn't give you the implications or the significance but by telling a story around each part of the brain and each like you know how he discovered something and how the tests are done you really get a sense of like okay this is how the brain actually works so telltale brain ramachandran phenomenal phenomenal book that one is is actually kind of what spurred me to work on these next levels of cognitive architectures on task by david bader i found the dust jacket i talked about this one in a previous video and i don't like dust jackets but it's pretty so on task how the brain gets things done um so this this book is about cognitive control another way of of talking about cognitive control is executive function so more people are probably going to be more familiar with the term like executive dysfunction which is common with um adhd and depression and other other things like that so executive dysfunction means that you're focusing on the wrong things and that you can't focus on the right things the the neuroscience term for that is cognitive control so cognitive control means like okay you're aware of what's going on and what you should be doing and and you have conscious ability to say this is what my brain should be focusing not this other thing so it's about impulse control it's about filtering it's about being self-directing um so yeah on task here let me just set this down um so on task is about how the brain achieves that and if you've done any work with large language models or gpt-3 you will know that it has no cognitive control so this is a huge thing that um that needs to be added in either more advanced neural network models um you know the architecture or it needs to be a secondary system or a a way of controlling what the model does that's really what we're going to focus on today because that's the breakthrough that i've had however i did also want to talk about a thousand brains so this this book also figures into the diagrams the architectures we're going to go over today um so let's see let me just have this up in the background um so yeah if you uh if you read this book base the the whole the whole idea is that the brain is made of repeating circuits that mostly do the same thing but they kind of vote um so there's kind of like a consensus about what they about how to decide what to do and i will show you how we can implement that soon we'll get to it today but very important ideas in terms of how do you design artificial

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Artificial cognitive entities (ACOGs) are a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on replicating the workings of the human mind. In this video, we will be focusing on the inner loop of an ACOG, which deals with thoughts, planning, and memories. We will also be discussing the nexus, or shared database, which acts as the ACOG's stream of consciousness.

Neuroscience plays a vital role in understanding how ACOGs work. In particular, the study of cognitive control helps us to understand how the ACOG can focus on the right task at hand. The book "On Task" by David Bader is a great resource for learning about cognitive control.

The brain is made up of repeating circuits that mostly do the same thing, but they also vote on what to do. This voting process is known as consensus. Implementing consensus in an ACOG is a crucial step in making it smarter and more efficient.

In conclusion, the inner loop and nexus of an ACOG are essential components of its artificial intelligence. By understanding how these components work, we can create smarter and more efficient ACOGs.
