TRANSCRIPT: scarlet letter on hester's bosom is that really what happened that seems like it's an entirely different i don't know that any of that actually happened where did it get this burr oh okay oh interesting so it kind of it it summarized like the details in the final bit hmm okay um i don't necessarily like that summary because the first one like you look how different these are so the first one was in this passage roger chillingworth etc etc um but we miss out on the details of the burs right so it's like okay um so the wording that i used in another time was using a moderate summary of the following so moderate summary means like okay compress it but not too much so we'll just say moderate summary interesting so it's kind of ignoring the beginning in both of these because even this one this moderate summary is more like the second one so like hester prin and her daughter pearl are walking through a graveyard but then you see this one like it's almost like we need to have both of these so we want what i'm trying to do here is get something that that feels like a good summary um [Music] so let's say let's write a detailed summary um detailed summary that looks a little bit better okay so this this captures both okay so if we say detailed summary it's about twice as long but it looks like it got all of the details that we want um so let's say uh it the le the selection that we did is 838 characters so that's still more than a factor of four because we went from 4 000 characters to less than a thousand so okay so it's a quarter as long um i like that i think we're going to stick with this as as our as our prompt um okay so we're gonna do this we're gonna all right here i'll just copy all this in okay write a detailed summary of the following summary and then we kill all that and we say this is our new prompt prompt prompt dot text okay so then what we do is for each chunk here let me close some of this excessive stuff okay so for each for chunk and chunk we're going to say prompt equals open file dot text dot replace um summary summary sorry with chunk so basically what that'll do is each of these four thousand character chunks will get put in here and then we'll send it up to gpth3 to summarize and i hope i don't run out of tokens we'll see all right pardon me i went for a really long bike ride earlier so i'm still rehydrating um okay gpt3 completion [Music] um token limit 1000 yeah because uh we'll probably that's fine all right so then summary equals gpt three completion prompt okay so that'll give us our summary we'll print out the summary just so that we can watch it going and then we'll do result dot append summary um that should be good and then once it's all done we'll do let's see how is it that you join a list let's see if i can remember python um l equals one one two three and then you do was i think join l uh what i'm trying to do is like join um join it all into a string um let's see python join list of strings into single string join list of strings that's what i did expected string instance and found oh that's what i did wrong okay so we do i did do it right i just wrong data type okay so then we just add a space dot join l okay that'll out of space cool all right that's what i wanted um all right so then we do uh save file save file and then the content will be uh let's see um space dot join result and then it'll be output dot text and so that'll just um actually here let's do let's do double new line i think that'll be better because then there will be a vertical space between each um each section so we can see where the summary boundaries of the summarization happened um that'll make it a little bit easier to see i think um yeah okay so that's good and yeah okay then let's do another thing so i i sometimes do this import re and so then text will equal text equals re sub and i'll do s um white space plus so this is like if it adds in too much um too much white space so like uh oh i already closed it um if there's too much two minute too much vertical white space or too many new lines this will this will compress the output into a single single line so resub this is regex sub which is substitute so we substitute anything that is more than one white space with just a single normal space and so white space is vertical new lines tabs anything like that and then this is what we're acting on um so that'll make it nice and compressed and pretty um i think that's it i think so uh let's see how long is this gonna be because the input is 171 kilobytes and it's about four kilobytes each so how many chunks um so 171 kilobytes divided by four kilobytes so that'll be about 42 sections that shouldn't be too bad 42 instances um and really what i should do is save it as we go just so i can show you and then i need to add gpt3 logs folder so that's where i have this function save it out to you see right here gpt3 logs um let's go ahead and run it heck with it let's see how it does um cd recursive summarizer python recursive recursively summarize open ai is not defined what do you mean i gotta import openai always forget something import open ai and away it goes so i can probably make these chunks a little bit longer like five thousand um there we go she escapes by climbing a tree excellent alice falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a long dark tunnel yeah okay this is great um all right so this is running it looks like it's doing just fine i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video so you don't have to watch this run through you know 40 40 iterations or whatever but it looks like it's doing pretty well so let's let's pause it and then we'll be back in just a second okay and we're back it didn't take too terribly long but we're done it was 42 um 42 chunks total and i predicted 42.75 so spot on um when it's encoded as utf-8 it's about one to one in terms of characters and um and uh or a thousand characters is roughly one kilobyte uh put it that way um okay so all that being said um here's
