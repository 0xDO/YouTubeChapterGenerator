how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:42:31.680,0:42:38.700
replace you know that with that you know depending
on uh the kind of format you're looking for
0:42:39.360,0:42:43.860
um so I just got out of the habit of of
returning the function result directly
0:42:44.820,0:42:50.220
um and and capturing the results in a variable and
then passing the variable back it's either or you
0:42:50.220,0:42:57.060
can do whatever you want um it saves you a line of
code um but you know okay a line of code who cares
0:42:58.080,0:43:07.380
um to me it's not really worth saving
okay so then research equals research plus
0:43:09.120,0:43:16.680
um let's see that's going to have no new line so
we'll do plus new line dollar s and then we'll
0:43:16.680,0:43:24.900
do dollar result um yes okay so the research
will be done so research equals research dot
0:43:24.900,0:43:32.160
strip which that will remove any Superfluous white
space from the ends so now we've got the research
0:43:35.280,0:43:40.980
yes so we'll run the research a couple
times we've done the research and then
0:43:40.980,0:43:50.880
we take the research and write the blog
post okay so do first draft not draft five
0:43:52.200,0:44:00.060
um okay this should be as straightforward
as prompt equals prompt section no
0:44:01.800,0:44:11.700
what am I doing good grief open file
prompt sectionpros dot text and do replace
0:44:13.500,0:44:19.680
research with research so this is there's a
couple things happening here so there's prompt
0:44:19.680,0:44:25.500
chaining which is where you've got prompt prompt
prompt prompt prompt so that's prompt chaining
0:44:25.500,0:44:30.780
but then we're also doing iterative Loops so we're
doing recursive Loops inside of the prompt chain
0:44:32.160,0:44:37.140
um so this is this is pretty Advanced but this
is this is just the same process that a human
0:44:37.140,0:44:43.800
goes through when writing when writing a thing
you you brainstorm the structure you gather
0:44:43.800,0:44:48.720
all the facts then you write the pros and then
you iterate on the pros and make it better um
0:44:51.300,0:44:55.680
now I need to improve on it I wonder
if it would be good if we gave it
0:44:55.680,0:45:00.300
some descriptions like we need to make
it more engaging um but whatever okay
0:45:06.480,0:45:16.380
prompt open file okay and so then we'll
say Pros equals bd3 completion um prompt
0:45:19.080,0:45:19.860
there you have it
0:45:21.900,0:45:25.380
all right so that's our first
edition of the pros and then
0:45:25.380,0:45:28.380
we do the same thing here where we
attach the research and the pros
0:45:30.780,0:45:36.780
this should actually probably we'll change
this to Pros keep it nice and consistent
0:45:38.520,0:45:43.140
and I think we did it what like two or three times
before it started kind of going off the rails
0:45:46.020,0:45:53.880
so we'll do we'll do just two improvements
of improving the pros um okay so Pros equals
0:45:54.960,0:46:03.360
um uh improve Pros and so what did I have
in here we have the research on the pros
0:46:04.320,0:46:12.240
research and prose um so we just improve itself
so recursive programming for for kitties who
0:46:12.240,0:46:18.600
don't know you could not do this where you pass
a variable where you you assign a variable and
