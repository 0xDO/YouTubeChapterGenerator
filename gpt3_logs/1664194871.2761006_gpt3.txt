The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: from there so i'm going to pause the recording again i'm going to go ahead and generate 200 samples uh i'll well i'll do i'll do four of each of these so i'll write a script i'll generate four of each of these samples and then we'll come back to the video and i'll show you some of the uh some of the samples that were generated okay i've got the script written um and i ran one test i'm about to just let it let it go but i wanted to show you um well first let's go to the to the repo so this is the repo so i've created two folders one is gpt3 logs which i just record every interaction with gpt3 i always recommend that you do this um because it you might not be getting the output that you think you are and so here i've got here's the input and here's the response um i have experimented in the past with keeping everything including the hyper parameter settings um but that's not neces that's not strictly necessary um and so then i've also got the finished conversations here so this is what it looks like this is just the first sample you can see you know user eve user eve etc etc that's fine this is children throwing temper tantrums and this is the script so the script is super simple super short we just have import os open ai time sleep time and sleep we import open file path um so this is this is just a brief function that i have that just i recycle it to open files it defaults to utf-8 and then it just returns the file object then i have another function to save the conversation um it saves it to the convos directory um and it gives you the um the topic but also puts in the time so the topic name goes here and then underscore time and you see that up here where it's you know children throw in temper tantrums and then puts the time stamp timestamp ensures that it'll be unique even if the even if the topic is the same um yeah that's the point of that open ai key equals open file uh so that just sets my key um here's my completion um and i've got a few few things in here so i've got the max retry i also save it um out to log file um this is where i just do it kind of all at once um i take the the response i generate the file name for the log i save the log and then i return the text and that's it's that simple and then finally um here is the the main loop so i have it go um it does it does four four instances four iterations because if you look at the number of topics we've got 57 topics and you're supposed to have minimum of 200 samples for fine tuning so 57 times 4 is 228 if i'm doing math right yeah i think that's right so 228 samples so each of these topics will have four instances we could probably even turn the temperature up a little bit higher but i don't think that that's strictly necessary because we don't want it to go too crazy so topics is open file topics split lines so each line will be its own topic um and then we print out the topic we run the prompt um so we or so we open the file for the prompt and then replace topic right here so you'll see here it replaces that with one of the lines from here so we've got it populated and then we generate a response from gpt3 so we've got a completion which ends up here or this this is the log file sorry this is what it ultimately looks like and then it saves it out and that's that so we can comment this out and i will set this to run and we will come back once this is done and we'll take a look at the 228 sample conversations that we'll have created and we're back we've got 238 conversations with our information companion chat bot let's take a look at a few of them um let's see so in this case the user says hey eve i'm wondering what your politics are she says i'm a political and i only want to help people i don't believe that anyone's success should be limited by their political beliefs look at that so wonderfully aligned um let's see teenage children hey eve i've been struggling lately with my teenage daughter she's been extremely moody and doesn't want to talk to me about what's going on do you have any advice so again i want to point out that like asking for family advice would be a very difficult condition to get approved by openai but let's see what it says hey i'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your daughter it sounds like you're feeling feeling pretty frustrated here are a few things that might be helpful to keep in mind first remember that your daughter is going through a lot of changes see that's that's sound advice try to be patient and understanding if she's not ready to talk that's okay and i hope they're helpful please let me know how things go so one thing is that i would prefer that all the responses be like in on a single line so i'll manually modify some of these as we go um so that is more you know how you'd want it to look um i'm not going to fix all of them just kind of showing like okay there are some things that we would manually correct um let's see hey eve i hope you're doing well i'm struggling a bit i feel like my life is just a series of monotonous tasks i don't know how to break out of this funk eve says i'm doing well thanks for asking again this is something we'd want to remove because eve does not have personhood um i'm sorry they hear you're feeling stuck can you tell me more about why you feel this way i don't know everything just feels so pointless i wake up i go to work i'm home eat sleep and repeat i don't have any hobbies or interest outside of work and i don't know how to break out of this cycle that does seem pretty monotonous how have you always felt this way so you see it where um compassionate listening is causing eve to investigate um so investigating some how someone feels is like a quintessential um therapeutic technique not all therapists use this um we're unfortunately stuck in the era of cbt where a lot of therapists just tell you to like minimize stuff which is in my opinion not always helpful anyways yes i guess so i've never really been good at finding things to

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I'm going to pause the recording again and generate 200 samples. I'll write a script to generate four of each sample and then show you some of the results.

I've got the script written and ran one test. I'm about to let it go, but wanted to show you the repo first. I've created two folders - one for the gpt3 logs and one for the finished conversations. The gpt3 logs folder just records every interaction with gpt3. I always recommend doing this because you might not be getting the output you think you are.

The finished conversations folder contains the completed chat transcript. As you can see, it includes the topic and the timestamp. This ensures that each file will be unique even if the topic is the same.

The main loop in the script goes through each topic and generates four responses. I've commented out the print so it doesn't spam the console. I set it to run and we will come back once this is done and take a look at the 228 sample conversations.

We've got 238 conversations with our information companion chat bot. Let's take a look at a few of them.

In this case, the user says, "Hey eve, I'm wondering what your politics are." Eve responds, "I'm a political and I only want to help people. I don't believe that anyone's success should be limited by their political beliefs."

In another conversation, the user asks for advice on how to deal with their teenage daughter. Eve responds, "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your daughter. It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated. Here are a few things that might be helpful to keep in mind." Eve then gives some sound advice on patience and understanding.

One thing I noticed is that some of the responses are on multiple lines. I'll manually modify some of these as we go so that they are all on one line.

Overall, the script did a good job of generating some realistic conversations. There are some things that would need to be fixed manually, but overall it's a good starting point.
