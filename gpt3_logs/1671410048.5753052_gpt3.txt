0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

CHAPTER TITLE: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence



TRANSCRIPT:
0:16:22.500,0:16:31.080
um Step oh two oh so you might notice I started
I I um I do my functions like in order so that
0:16:31.080,0:16:35.340
way like if you're looking at this repo you don't
have to like try and reverse engineer what order
0:16:35.340,0:16:43.200
to run things in like it's just intrinsic
documentation um dedupe characters dot pi
0:16:45.600,0:16:59.220
okay python step O2 and I know that it's going to
barf on this so let's do any coding E equals UTF
0:17:00.180,0:17:05.700
utf-9 utf-9 is clearly better than
utf-8 right it's the next mission
0:17:07.440,0:17:13.140
sorry I'm in a mood today apparently
you having a giggle Mite okay um
0:17:15.420,0:17:16.380
let's see if it works
0:17:20.400,0:17:24.540
I'm not going to use the GPU for
something this simple it's a small
0:17:25.260,0:17:31.080
skipping registered can't find and it
doesn't seem to be a python package huh
0:17:37.500,0:17:43.620
let's see um it gave me this error
0:17:46.740,0:17:48.000
what does it mean
0:17:50.400,0:17:51.660
it didn't work
0:17:58.140,0:18:00.600
and this is the value of
having good error messages kids
0:18:17.400,0:18:19.800
interesting all right
0:18:31.140,0:18:35.220
let's see if that worked still didn't work
0:18:40.080,0:18:48.780
um okay all right so in this case it seems like we
found a limitation still didn't work Spacey load
0:18:54.960,0:18:56.940
says requirement already satisfied
0:18:59.040,0:19:02.220
yeah it says it's already satisfied um
0:19:04.320,0:19:09.180
let's go let's go to Google
let's see if uh let's see if this
0:19:18.540,0:19:19.380
all right
0:19:26.280,0:19:26.880
import
0:19:35.040,0:19:37.500
so it looks like you need
to do you need to install
0:19:49.740,0:19:50.640
let's try this
0:19:56.700,0:19:58.080
that looks like it did a thing
0:20:05.880,0:20:09.840
sorry I wasn't talking through it so
basically I was looking I found I found
0:20:09.840,0:20:16.800
a Spacey issue on GitHub and um let's see it
hasn't bombed yet so I wonder if it's working
0:20:18.780,0:20:26.220
um dedupt cool there's nothing
that's 20 uh no it didn't work
0:20:28.620,0:20:29.940
still didn't work okay
0:20:33.060,0:20:33.560
um
0:20:39.240,0:20:43.920
yeah so seems like Spacey is not
sufficient or at least this isn't
0:20:45.060,0:20:56.160
um okay so let's go back here go back to this um
okay I got Spacey to load but the original script
0:20:56.700,0:21:07.860
does not work the words um in some files are
still wrong um with lots of duplicated characters
0:21:10.080,0:21:11.100
um so for instance
0:21:16.680,0:21:17.580
for example
0:21:23.460,0:21:25.320
I probably should ask another way
0:21:27.360,0:21:27.860
yep
0:21:30.540,0:21:33.120
yep okay so it's actually going to tell me
0:21:33.720,0:21:39.360
yeah use regex so that's regex is actually the
way I would have done it originally so it looks
0:21:39.360,0:21:44.100
like this might be the right way to do it it
so all right let's see what it says foreign
0:21:47.760,0:21:50.580
do the same thing okay
