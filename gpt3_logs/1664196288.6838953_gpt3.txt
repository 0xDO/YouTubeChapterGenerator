The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: of course distributed computing has been around for a long time um but so this is just the next logical development of that um so good good little graphic there I like pictures um let's see and they talk about the performance and and all the methods so what what I think is most interesting is uh they they talk about like what are the incentives right so um the if you if you contribute so when when there was folding at home and study at home really the only incentive was you got to be on the leaderboard right you know it was publicly stated how much you know how many packets you had processed or whatever but in the era of cryptocurrency you could actually earn provable work right like the proof of work is work that you're actually doing for the world um and so you get points or tokens or something and we'll get to this in a minute um and so then you can spend those tokens for whatever um they're just speculating that this is something that you could do but say for instance you get process tokens or um those entitle you to something else um you know you could exchange it for money you could exchange it for processor time something like that security so when you have a distributed system there is going to be um there is going to need to be uh lots of uh awareness of potentially malicious actors so you're probably going to have to have gatekeeping and reputation management on on these networks you might have private networks so you know kind of what happened with um with Torrance is that you ended up with with private peer-to-peer torrents um you might end up with you know PODS of of security of trusted things and they actually talk about that here with privacy as well um so a key limitation of our approach is that peers serving the first layers of the model can use their inputs to recover input tokens thus clients working with sensitive data should only use servers hosted by trusted institutions that are allowed to process this data so again security and privacy it's kind of it might be answered by the same thing where you have private fleets or federations of distributed gpus from making changes to the main model um so like if you if you adopt a New Foundation model but basically what petals allows you to do is is both do inference um I think they also allow training but inference and fine-tuning um for large language models which is currently um an intractable problem for uh individuals to do just because it's so expensive um so yeah this is a really great um really great thing and you see that there's it's kind of a global team you've got some Asian names some Eastern European names um yeah so this is this is definitely the way of the future and speaking of distribution ahead folks from towel reach out to me and I've had lots of people telling me that I should look into Tau for a while so what is Tau Tau is a type of of Dao decentralized autonomous organization so what is a dow a dow is a decentralized autonomous organization it is a way of creating and managing any kind of organization of people whether it is a for-profit company an academic institution or even a government um and basically what it uses is it uses the public Ledger technology of blockchain in order to register everyone's ownership votes controls that sort of thing um so it is a system of governance um and I know if if you as a watcher are still skeptical of the power of blockchain for this keep in mind that Australia recently moved their um their public Stock Exchange over to a blockchain technology um and there's plenty of other uh companies and Nations all over the world experimenting with both private Ledger and public ledger blockchain so remember that blockchain is not intrinsically public Ledger that's just the Bitcoin implementation was a public Ledger you can have a private blockchain that is not distributed across um or that is publicly visible anyways so with the Dow a distributed autonomous organization that would be a private Ledger or could be set up as a private Ledger anyways I don't want to get too bogged down in talking about what a dow is um but uh the the the foundation team the leadership team these are legit folks um all uh phds or otherwise um well-established folks with doctorates and professorships and so on so what is the point of this um tau is one experiment among many but one of the things that they're doing is they are working on distributed inference as well but they have the economy part so here they talk about incentives so Tau actually is working on that with their their agaris um cryptocurrency so one of the one of the goals and this is very aspirational though is to create something that could replace or augment democracies so with democracy today it is very old-fashioned in that you have a straight up and down vote you basically vote for or against a person or an initiative there's no discussion so what one thing that that a lot of us on my Discord server and Tau and in other places what a lot of people are talking about is working towards more of a consensus model and I've talked about consensus before so consensus is different from democracy in that it is a process of negotiation and discussion and development of new ideas the scientific Community works on consensus right you publish a paper people chew on it they discuss it they disagree with it they write responses it's peer-reviewed um and so over time uh the scientific process is very slow and that is by Design and consensus is also slow and it's by Design but it is participatory um everyone gets a say and then of course someone's reputation um dictates or it influences how much their say impacts things so there's a novel that a friend of mine recommended called liquid rain that explores this in part it basically says a guy guy goes into a coma today and wakes up in the year like I think it was 2054 and so it's basically an exploration of how the world might be different in three decades and one of the key features of that novel

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Distributed computing has been around for a long time, but the recent development of cryptocurrency has created new incentives for people to contribute to these projects. With cryptocurrency, people can earn "proof of work" tokens that can be exchanged for other things of value. This creates a potential for people to be paid for their contributions to distributed computing projects.

Security is a key concern in distributed computing. Because there is no central authority, it is difficult to prevent malicious actors from harming the system. Gatekeeping and reputation management may be necessary to protect the system from attack. Privacy is also a concern, as sensitive data may be accessible to anyone who has access to the system.

The Tau project is one example of a distributed computing project that is using cryptocurrency to create incentives for people to contribute. Tau is working on developing a system that could replace or augment democracies. This system would use consensus-based decision making, which would allow everyone to have a say in the decisions made by the system.
