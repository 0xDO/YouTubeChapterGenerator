CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

This is my epic writing prompt generator. You can run this every day for many years, and you'll never get the same one. So another thing that happens is because I use a uuid and a high temperature, even if you run the same exact plot or a set of appeal factors through it, you're not going to get the same plot synopsis twice. So technically, you have an infinite number of plots in this plot generator. Sorry that's the plot. That's the novel writer, but the plot synopsis generator technically can get an infinite array of stories.

Ok, cool. Well, I'm satisfied with this. Once I get a little bit in case you're curious about where I'm going with some of this stuff, this is there's a reason there's a method to my madness. So I've got the synopsis generator, the novel writer that does that uses the plotter method. One other thing that I worked on was the creative writing coach.

The creative writing coach was this actually this was an idea that came from Reddit where someone wanted some something to provide feedback. Ok, well so what happens when you when you get a manuscript? So it'll only take another couple of days worth of work I think to get this to generate a full manuscript. I've been taking notes about how to expand each section.

So then you get a manuscript but what if it's garbage? That's that's been the big problem with AI generated stuff is that it's garbage. And to be fair, a lot of human first drafts are garbage. So that means we need to integrate a cycle of of iterative improvement of refinement. And that is where I'm going to take my previous work on a creative writing coach to provide feedback.

And so the idea is that you this this repo, the plotter novel will just generate a manuscript. The idea is to get between 50 and 100,000 words. That's most stories. It's much harder to handle longer stories like up to 300,000 words, but the definition of a novel is 50 to 60,000 words. And if you say that's an average of a thousand words per scene, so that's 50 to 60 scenes, that's not the hardest thing in the world. So that's what I'm aiming for for the first version.

But then once you get a manuscript, it's an entirely different process to make it better. So the goal here is to generate a manuscript just barf it out as you know whatever whatever you put in. And that's where the synopsis comes in. So step one come up with a synopsis. Step two generate a manuscript. Step three make it better. So that's what I'm working on. And who knows we're only a month and a half away from Nano genmo, so maybe I will just spit out a whole bunch of of automatically generated novels for November for Nano nanogenmo nanowrimo.

Good morning. I'm really excited because this I I have a feeling that this is gonna work. I've been playing around with gpt3 for a couple years now. And I've been experimenting with cognitive architectures. And I'm not even a semi-pro author. I've spent more money as an author than I've made as an author. But I do it for the love of the art.

And so now I'm going to try and pour everything that I know about making stories into making them automatically. And we'll see how it goes. The idea that there might be an infinite number of stories out there to to write for people. Because some people like you know. Yeah, all right anyways. I'm rambling. I'm gonna stop there. I hope you enjoyed this. Please feel free to use the synopsis generator. And just yeah run with it. All right talk to everyone later.
