how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:06:33.200,0:06:39.440
here's the open ai blog about our approach
to alignment research now in one in one
0:06:42.480,0:06:49.120
capacity they do explicitly say like we are on
the path to agi and then unaligned agi could
0:06:49.120,0:06:54.880
pose substantial risk to humanity yeah like
that's good like okay just say it out loud
0:06:54.880,0:07:03.840
say it directly and let's move on um so but then
like so their current goal is to is to automate
0:07:03.840,0:07:08.720
the the alignment research which i think like okay
that's that's one approach i don't necessarily
0:07:08.720,0:07:14.640
think that that's the best approach um but the
goal is still to create an autonomous machine okay
0:07:15.200,0:07:21.440
so they're they're aiming for autonomy so that's
good um you know but they don't have any statement
0:07:21.440,0:07:27.520
about like let's let's create an autonomous
machine let's imagine the future where we assume
0:07:27.520,0:07:32.240
that machines are going to be smarter than us and
that they're going to be autonomous how do we how
0:07:32.240,0:07:38.000
do we address that um and so they're talking about
like you know human feedback and training models
0:07:38.000,0:07:45.280
to us to assist and so what they talk about here
is like um you know like okay you're talking about
0:07:45.280,0:07:51.680
summarizing books what does that have to do with
alignment right because if you're not thinking
0:07:51.680,0:07:58.080
about the problem structurally correctly then your
research might not matter and that's that's what i
0:07:58.080,0:08:04.960
mean is like the you know the the the nightmare
scenario scenario that everyone is afraid of is
0:08:04.960,0:08:12.560
that ai becomes autonomous it becomes sentient and
then it decides to kill us um and yeah like okay
0:08:13.280,0:08:17.200
um you know this this one is probably the
most relevant we trained a model to write
0:08:17.200,0:08:22.800
critical comments on its own outputs i did that
too it's not that big a deal but the idea is that
0:08:22.800,0:08:29.840
um it can think right and so they're getting
closer to the idea of a cognitive architecture
0:08:29.840,0:08:34.960
and if you read my book symphony of thought i
talk very extensively about these feedback loops
0:08:34.960,0:08:41.680
of where you have one model produce an idea and
another model um either comment on it or just
