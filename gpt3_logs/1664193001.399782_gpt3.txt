The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody David Shapiro here with your daily videos oh let me cancel out a flux so that the screen doesn't look too orange okay um so Auto Muse uh if you saw the live stream last night which you might not depending on when you're watching this video um I explained why I'm open sourcing Auto Muse and I'm Gonna Keep it all open source from here on um the short version is two things happened one is I had a conversation with some of the folks at Tau and I realized like no I got to focus on the things that are really important which is making sure that AGI happens correctly and of course I'm not going to do that by myself there are plenty of people working on it around the world but I can focus on doing my part rather than focusing on writing novels um well I mean I'll still write my own novel but I don't need to keep this code secret um more important things to focus on code wise the second thing that happened was I got feedback from my editor for my novel and I realized that um that no matter how good someone is as a writer and by no means am I an expert I've been studying the craft for almost four years um and it takes you know a lifetime to master an art um but even so despite all the effort the crazy amount of effort I've read so many books and gone to so many workshops um I send my my novel to an editor sorry I send my novel to an editor and there's just so much more expertise that goes into editing a novel then goes into writing a novel it's a different kind of expertise and so what I realized is that the relationship between an author and an editor is actually a lot like a generative adversarial Network where on the one hand I am the generator I'm generating a work and then the editor is the discriminator um and so uh I realized that that while while we can definitely do some some generative adversarial networks with gpt3 on small scale things um it is not going to be possible with the current token limits um like we can do we can do again for short stories and flash fiction um and even trying to do it in sections is not going to be possible so even if I had a few years to work on like fine tuning and summarization and stuff um it's just it's not going to happen so I'm not worried about disrupting an industry the technology isn't there yet but there are a few things that we can do so as part of the auto Muse project I'll start with the synopsis generator and the synopsis generator does exactly what it says on the tin it generates synopsis and so I've generated um 200 some odd synopses and let me uh well here they don't look good on on GitHub so let me show you what they look like here so I've generated a whole bunch I've deleted the ones that were too big and too small and I kind of wish that I hadn't because you can you can keep those bad data points and measure them but um yeah so here's an example like in the First Century A.D the Roman Empire is at its height of power but in The far-flung Outpost of Britannia things are far from stable so this is like hey this is cool young Centurion named Marcus flavius Aquila arrives in Britannia with a mission so this is like a really great story starting off Marcus search for the eagle takes them all over Britannia this is a story that I would read this would be like a great movie um oh my coffee's over here why did I put it over there um yeah so we have like a full story end to end so how did I do this let me explain it to you oh and also sorry um let me zoom in a little bit okay so we will go over the synopsis generator so we will do uh generate synopsis so here's the code it's pretty straightforward so I do seed just to get a little bit of entropy and then for I and list of range 0 to 200 you can just comment this out if you want to just generate one but I was generating bulk data for fine tuning and you probably actually don't want to do this because um I realize that fine tuning um is still uh is still as expensive as it was before and so it is inordinately expensive to do fine tuning compared to just generating data and then discriminating against the data so I'll show you how to do that in just a moment but also I realize that I need to clean up my find and replace a little bit so let's see do replace and then we'll just get rid of semicolons um because what what I did was I'll show you why those are why these are here in just a second because of the prompt beginning middle and then we'll do end being because sometimes it does ending and then we'll do dot replace and we'll do end if it is there oops and then we do remove double spaces okay so that cleans it up okay so it's pretty pretty simple um first I set a unique identifier and so that ends up being here in the under current ID and I did this just so that if you run repeatedly or if you chain it to another thing you know what the last one that you generated was this was when I thought it was going to be part of a pipeline um because if you have multiple steps you want to be able to pass information from run step to the other and I just write it to file you can kind of ignore that if you want um okay so but where were we generate synopsis um yeah so you save the current file and then you uh or first I guess you generate the synopsis all right so here's the function to generate the synopsis so you pick a random genre tone character paste storyline style setting and time um so there's eight different variables and they get piped into this prompt so think like a professional author brainstorm an extremely long complete detailed synopsis for a novel with the following appeal terms oh it's a mouthful um so I gave it a whole bunch of things oh and I also put a uu ID up at the top to just prime it with some some entropy so you multiply all these out and I did have another video describing this but this is a little bit more sophisticated um and also that video kind of stalled anyways so brainstorming extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning middle and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the first century AD, the Roman Empire is at its height of power. However, in the far-flung outpost of Britannia, things are far from stable. A young Centurion named Marcus Flavius Aquila arrives in Britannia with a mission to find an eagle, which takes him all over the country. Along the way, he must deal with hostile natives, treacherous allies, and his own inner demons.
