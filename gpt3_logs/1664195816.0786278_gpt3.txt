The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: matching thing it can keep going so find food find water find shelter find a way to communicate with the outside world it basically gave me the same kind of of information here brainstorm a list of ideas to serve on a deserted island and it repeated it so you see these repetitions happening how do you get that to stop here you can do backslash n backslash n so that's newline newline so what will happen is if it gives you a double new line it'll stop whoops gather food and water find shelter oh wait it didn't stop why didn't it stop i wonder if it's um rn slash rn so there's several ways that it can do new lines so slash r is carriage return and slash n is newline um let's see if that works nope still not stopping what the actual heck that's really weird because the stop sequence should unless it might be it might be treating this like text let me do view code oh yeah so see what it did is it escaped my backslashes so while we're here let me show you something super useful if you're trying to get if you if you get a result that you like in here with all the settings and stuff you just click view code and it'll pop up and show you like oh look here's the uh here's here's what you did and so the stop sequence right here where you see it says backslash backslash n and backslash backslash n that means it's escaping it so it's removing it as a regex so it's not evaluating it like regex i want it to evaluate it like regex but it's not gonna do that so unfortunately that's not gonna work um brainstorm a list of ideas for a haunted house now that's great um uh okay so if we if we stick with this we say all right so we're brainstorming so then if we do few shot where we give it a couple different examples so let's go ahead and let it finish finish this okay so then we say all right let's take out survive and we're just saying this is brainstorming and you notice how it's doing four items for each it's copying um it's copying the pattern exactly so now we're going to give it two examples where it's it's brainstorming entirely different things brainstorm a list of ideas of ways to survive on mars brainstorm a list of ideas for a haunted house uh let's see brainstorm a list of ideas to solve climate change so completely different domains um but i shouldn't even need to put in the one because it will it will have seen this pattern so remember it's autocomplete it's an autocomplete engine but it's also a pattern matching and pattern generation engine so that's how autocomplete works it says oh i've seen this pattern before like if you start it with a bbc news article it says i've seen plenty of bbc articles why because gbt3 was chained on you know hundreds of gigabytes of internet data um okay plant trees change the way yep there you go um actually here i thought of a good stop that we can use we can say brainstorm a list there that's gonna be our new stop um okay and so you can see like um i chose i chose something that is gonna that is gonna appear in a specific place and that'll be my new stop so plant trees change the way we produce energy change the transportation system change how we use energy um okay that's great these are not the best the best examples um because it's basically what it's copying is the amount of effort put into each one so like if we were to go back and expand on each of these and i'll show you in just a second what i mean um then it would uh it would do better all right so we're building up to a few shot examples so in in the original gpt3 what you'd have to do is in order to get very consistent output you'd have to give it several examples in every single prompt and that gets real old because you're basically training it very quickly to do what you want so let's do brainstorm a list of ideas to uh let's see what are we going to try and do um let's see something completely off the wall uh build the fanciest uh gaming pc ever and then we'll take out that all right we'll see what it does okay that's not particularly fascinating get the best computer parts get the best gaming monitor get the bet get a great gaming mouse get a gaming keyboard okay great whatever none of these are particularly impressive but the point here is to show you the difference between zero shot one shot and few shot prompting let me do a quick time check all right we're at 11 minutes let's cut it off there this will be a whole series but this is just showing you the basics of think of it as an autocomplete engine and there are three primary types of problems it's zero shot one shot and few shot once you build up an intuition for how um how these language models work then you'll understand the value of like the instruct series models and other ones that are aligned and and how they're fine-tuned and why that fine-tuning makes them more useful in certain ways all right thanks for watching uh like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon thanks and uh see you again soon

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The video explains how the GPT3 can be used for different types of prompts, including brainstorming ideas for a deserted island, a haunted house, or climate change. It demonstrates how the GPT3 can generate ideas based on a few examples, and how it can be customized to generate more consistent output.
