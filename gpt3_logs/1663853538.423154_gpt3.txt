how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:23:31.680,0:23:41.580
it public so this one you can take a look
at um it basically uh it got pretty far but
0:23:42.840,0:23:49.860
it's still like it just it lost the plot all the
time but what I found was that if you switch to
0:23:49.860,0:23:56.100
original DaVinci original DaVinci is way better
at writing fiction because the um the instruct
0:23:56.100,0:24:02.760
series was not trained to write efficient um so
it's usually really garbage at it but because our
0:24:02.760,0:24:08.040
original Da Vinci is not fine-tuned if you give
it a chunk of prose it'll just take that chunk of
0:24:08.040,0:24:14.700
pros and run with it and so if you explore these I
was working on an idea of like basic outlines and
0:24:14.700,0:24:19.620
advanced outlines and then um you know it's kind
of smushing it all together and this is this is a
0:24:19.620,0:24:27.180
hot mess if you want to take the time to um to dig
through it um I've I've unlocked the video where I
0:24:27.180,0:24:33.360
was explaining this um let's see where is the one
I think it was here oh yeah so if you look at this
0:24:33.360,0:24:39.540
file I'm not going to say it out loud um but look
at this uh this was the one that worked the best
0:24:40.200,0:24:45.960
um and so you see the whole process of it of it
trying to go through and then it gets too long but
0:24:45.960,0:24:54.900
this story was really weird it was it was really
dark um but it was it actually like touched in
0:24:54.900,0:24:59.580
on like I don't know I was reading it as it was
being generated I'm like okay I'm really on to
0:24:59.580,0:25:06.360
something here um but this was like one out of ten
worked a little bit and then because so remember I
0:25:06.360,0:25:11.940
was saying like you kept I kept running out of
tokens like even with summarization you cannot
0:25:11.940,0:25:17.220
get a full-length novel you could probably do
a novella like up to maybe 20 000 words with a
0:25:17.220,0:25:25.860
with a shorter uh plot structure but gp3 cannot
do full-length novels yet um I tried and tried
0:25:25.860,0:25:32.460
and tried to get enough material in this um maybe
you could do a little bit better with fine tuning
0:25:33.060,0:25:38.160
um so that way you you just give it a few data
points and I can write but yeah so it's not it's
0:25:38.160,0:25:43.020
not going to work um anyways yeah so those are
the those are the three things that I wanted to
