0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:12:12.720,0:12:17.580
some uh some example cover letters and see if
we can just embellish this just a little bit
0:12:20.760,0:12:26.940
okay looking at some examples of cover letters
I think the thing that's missing uh that meant
0:12:26.940,0:12:32.880
that many of these have is um there's kind of
a list in the middle of you know what you've
0:12:32.880,0:12:38.340
achieved so like here's a short one that's
okay um you know one paragraph okay that's
0:12:38.340,0:12:45.900
not not necessarily the best but usually there's
a list right in the middle of of kind of like uh
0:12:45.900,0:12:51.420
top achievements so let's come back to our data
and so here's here's where using something like
0:12:51.420,0:12:57.060
this is uh good because then you just add
a little bit more so like greatest strength
0:12:58.020,0:13:05.940
um so then we'll add um like list of achievements
um so like what are your um let's see
0:13:07.200,0:13:18.780
pop achievements um list so my answer is um
let's see talk achievements will be the label
0:13:19.500,0:13:24.480
um so let's see what are my top
achievements um let's see I wrote
0:13:25.020,0:13:35.880
three books about artificial cognition and
architectures um let's see I started a successful
0:13:36.840,0:13:50.280
YouTube Channel documenting my work and research I
published more than a hundred open source projects
0:13:50.280,0:13:57.240
on GitHub so that should be good all right so
all I had to do was just add this and I don't
0:13:57.240,0:14:02.280
have to change any code so this allows you
to rapidly customize and get better results
0:14:02.280,0:14:10.980
but one thing that I wanted to change about the
prompt cover letter um let's see um let's see fix
0:14:12.180,0:14:22.020
typos spelling and word choice if there are any
mistakes okay so highly professional cover letter
0:14:22.860,0:14:28.920
um so just by adding this if there's any if
there's any like lowercase whatever here we
0:14:28.920,0:14:35.280
should get a little bit better results oh
and also there should be a um yeah cover
0:14:35.280,0:14:43.020
letter here so it just saves the example um
all right so let's see what happens this time
0:14:47.640,0:14:50.700
I keep reaching for my coffee mug
and it's still empty imagine that
0:14:51.540,0:14:59.520
okay so yeah so just by giving it a little bit
more input um let's see my greatest strength is my
0:14:59.520,0:15:03.000
ability to think extremely fast this has allowed
me to achieve many great things in my career such
0:15:03.000,0:15:07.200
as writing three books about artificial cognition
and architectures starting a successful YouTube
0:15:07.200,0:15:11.820
channel and Publishing more than 100 open
source so again it's just kind of copy pasting
0:15:13.020,0:15:17.580
um New Field of artificial research within
artificial our new field of research within that
0:15:17.580,0:15:23.160
I believe that Acme robot there we go okay perfect
so by giving it just a little bit more information
0:15:23.160,0:15:27.600
it's getting a little bit more creative I believe
that Acme robot science is the perfect place to
0:15:27.600,0:15:33.240
achieve this goal as it is a company that is at
the Forefront of technological innovation bam got
0:15:33.240,0:15:37.560
it okay I'm excited about this opportunity
because it represents my absolute passion
0:15:38.400,0:15:43.260
um yep so I believe that I am a great fit for
this role because my extensive experience perfect
