TRANSCRIPT: funny what it tries to do um in terms of like trying to keep it realistic so speculative art so i really really like speculative art this looks like almost like character concept art um like you could imagine if you're storyboarding you know like some character um designs this actually looks way better this is almost like magic the gathering card oh look at that it's like an elf version of geralt so i really like the speculative art tag style tag it tends to get pretty good results because it's a little bit cleaner right and it's a little bit simpler because you look at this one and it's like okay this is this is something you could easily adapt um there's a lot less noise whereas you go to some of the original one like the high fantasy art and it's not as bad it's not bad but you get like it's just not as clean you see like the hair is kind of messy it almost looks like like it's been sponged or something um so high fantasy art um is good for some things but the speculative art really gives you that that clean clean aesthetic i already showed you 3d render let's do dramatic photo dramatic photo tends to do better with if you want a portrait of someone because it'll give you a nice tight shot um and with it with a neutral background usually but let's see how dramatic photo does um does here um yeah so like i really like the dramatic photo if you want like if you want to describe someone's face um oh that's interesting some of this is not remotely what i was asking for um that's a still life that's fine um okay didn't did not handle this well for some reason it just wants to show me food in the forest that's fine um the dramatic photo is really good so um let's say uh pretty elf with green eyes um and a face tattoo um i'm a big fan of uh dragon age so you can see where i got the inspiration for this so we take out the sunny forest and describe the face and then say dramatic photo um actually no we'll just um we'll just say a pretty woman with green eyes and a face tattoo dramatic photo because this will be more photorealistic and we'll go back to the to the elves in a second so one thing i noticed about dolly is that if you include any sci-fi or fantasy words in it at all the photo realism drops through the floor um so what i'll do is i'll so here oh here we go perfect look at this so dramatic photo um it gives you gives you crazy lighting um it got the green eyes although they're a little unsettling um this one's good uh this one's really good so you see how like it nailed like you you can see pores on her skin right so the it can do close-ups really well um and it's almost photorealistic oh she's imposing um okay so then if you just change one word we'll change pretty woman to pretty elf and you'll see that the photo realism drops through the floor it's gonna it's gonna look more more messy um and that's just i think it's an artifact of the training data because any image that it was trained on that had elf was more likely to be digital art digital painting stuff like that um actually no hmm i was completely wrong um maybe it was because of how simple it was it is still less photorealistic than the other ones but not bad i'm actually impressed um it got the you know pointy ears big big eyes and small face which is pretty typical of an elf um it was missing oh no i guess it's got a tattoo that's either a tattoo or a strand of hair that's fine um okay so i was i was wrong i've i've not had good luck with fantasy characters in the past if it was supposed to be a photo um but maybe it's because i picked elf which is a very common um trope and there's plenty of photo realistic elves out there because of stuff like lord of the rings okay so let's get this back speculative art high quality photo pointillism so pointillism is fun um did i spell it wrong it's got two l's so pointialism if you ever if you've ever seen any of the old naturalist like you know charles darwin drawings of things um pointillism was very common and before photography as a way to document what you saw out in nature and so if you wanted to draw like a representation of a turtle or you know a frog or something you you'd do pointillism as an art style um i think because one it was easy to reproduce in print um like on wood blocks but also i think it was easier to learn um because it doesn't require well i don't know i'm not an artist but pointillism was popular and so you can see this is a this is an easy style to adopt um yeah it worked pretty well pointillism is fun and then what is it called like yukio i'm thinking i'm spelling that wrong okay anyways i'll there's plenty of other art styles out there um so then what i found was that if you give it an artist um you can get some pretty amazing results so elven archer in a summit sunny forest by h.r geiger um so geiger as you might be familiar with um is the guy who was behind the aesthetic of alien um so those really eerie um xenomorphs um also geiger's artwork was uh in part used for um dune actually some of the murals of the worm um so this is interesting because you see some of the like flowing curves and abstractness but it doesn't really look like geiger but it's still a very different style than than the previous renderings oh here you go you see there's more metal um yeah okay there we go so you get the the curves and the metal that's that's got that's channeling some geiger but of course geiger did like aliens and machines and vaguely erotic stuff um so he never really did any elves um let's do soriyama soriyama also did sore amma i think i'm spelling that right sorayama did a lot of like chrome looking robots it's very distinctive art style so we'll see if if it channels that there we go yuki yukio dash e okay that didn't come through at all this doesn't look anything like zoryama's artwork that's fine i didn't expect it would his artwork is a little bit more obscure especially in the west very popular in the anime crowd that almost looks like link a very

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In terms of speculative art, I really like the clean look of the "speculative art" tag style. It's simpler and more efficient than other styles like "high fantasy art". I find that "dramatic photo" works well for portraits, especially when combined with a neutral background. However, I've noticed that if you include any sci-fi or fantasy words in the search term, the photo realism decreases significantly. For example, when I searched for "pretty elf with green eyes", the results were less photorealistic than when I searched for "pretty woman with green eyes". I think this is due to the training data for the algorithm, which is likely to be biased towards digital art and painting when it comes to fantasy characters. Nonetheless, I was surprised by how well the "dramatic photo" tag handled the elf search term, considering the difficulty of capturing photorealistic elves in photos. Overall, I think the "speculative art" tag style is a good choice for those looking for a clean, efficient way to create art.
