TRANSCRIPT: another puzzling question alice couldn't think of any good reason so let's see if that is see if that's in here it isn't okay so it looks like the story is kind of diverging just a little bit i should think you'll feel it a little queer wouldn't you okay so it is like word for word up to a certain point that's not entirely unexpected because this is the data that it was trained on so let's okay now here's the real test let's see let's see how well this does on on a brand new story so this is this is really this is really the crux of it so let's go to the um to the premises that i created in another project so let's see so we've got an outline in a world of high fantasy a young woman named alicia is on a quest to save her village from a band of marauders alicia is joined by a group of unlikely heroes including a daring thief a powerful wizard and a skilled archer okay we got the four four-man band um they need a fifth one if they want to hold to the mythic structure um together they must battle their way through hordes of enemies and solve puzzles to reach the marauders lair with courage and determination they defeat the marauders and save the village okay story so far um opening nothing has happened last chunk chapter one next chunk all right let's see what it says i might need to turn the temperature up because we're asking it to be creative yeah it's just like uh [Music] let's just give you a bunch of spaces okay we'll turn the temperature back up to 0.7 it's probably going to be super super super confused it's thinking and it unloaded my model that's fine let's zoom in a little bit but yeah so once we get to um alicia and her uncle yeah okay so i don't think this project is gonna work um someone on on reddit or youtube said like oh well you should probably start with smaller chunks like short stories or flash fiction that's entirely possible i wanted to set the bar really high for myself and clearly i did let's go let's turn this down to 250 and let's turn the temperature up to turn it up to max i'm wondering why it just keeps outputting spaces that's like it's like it has no idea what to do um but yeah so and it unloaded my model again um yeah so if i were to do this over you know so one one reason that i started where i did is because we've got gutenberg which gives you like a crap ton of data um so it's like okay well we've got plenty of data to start with um but short stories or flash fiction would be um would be a little bit better uh because then what you do is like you know we we've oh here we go it's actually going now excellent god zukes okay um let's let this run so this this whole thing is only 380 tokens um which is not much so let's turn this completion up to 500. okay let's see what it wrote so far alyssia and her and her uncle alicia they're both the same name stood near the window looking out into the lovely garden it was a bright warm sunny day rosy rays of the sun were shining through the trees making checkered patterns of light and shade on the young girl's face wow this is not bad she had a book in her hand but she was not reading nothing in the world seemed interesting to alessia just then but then the butterflies that were fluttering about outside not bad there were several of them sitting on the branches of the fur trees near the house looking at alicia and whispering among themselves the little girl was quite sure what they that they were talking about her and the faint spot of color came to into each pink cheek as she looked back at them presently they flew away and alessia turned her eyes slowly from the fir trees to the sky where some white and gray pigeons were floating about she watched them until they too flew away and then she put her head down into a cluster of briony and honeysuckle which filled the window space with it with it with its fragrance and shining feathery green leave godzilla said a voice close by alyssia started violently and dropped the book on the floor um here i'll wait for it to finish but yeah so then um actually this might it might have just needed a really high temperature okay it's doing next chunk so what that tells us what we need to do is add this as a stop sequence okay um godzilla said a voice close to her alyssia started violently and dropped the book on the floor but seeing that the speaker was her old tortoise tortoiseshell kitten she recovered herself and took up the volume it was a large ancient book with faint ink marks and pieces cut out of the middle and leaves were of different sizes and some notched as if as if for a paper knife stay where you are she said to the kitten and i'll get you a mouse her face lit up at the thought the kitten lay on its back and wriggled its paws airily in the air while alicia opened the window leaned out and called to her sister at that mo at that moment dr primrose happened to look out his study window and he called he called to alicia to come in then in obedience to a whispered command the kitten jumped off the windowsill and hopped into the study where it vanished completely from alicia's site this is getting a little weird here master william cried alyssia master william where are you um i'm guessing that's dr primrose and she climbed into the study and found him on the table by the window come catch a mouse for suet this is so strange this is like very dreamlike okay so what we'll do then is we'll copy this so what i'm going to do is just kind of show you manually what i'll do with a script so we say okay um do actually let's copy this whole thing because we will ultimately use some of this um all right so let's switch back to davinci o2 and we'll say write a concise summary of the following the following story concise summary that temperature might be too high see it's it's making this up alyssia climbs into the study like that didn't happen okay so let's turn the temperature back down a little bit um okay that that lost some of it that's okay all right but that still served its
