The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: the yep you say Grand shrine god of the sun goddessama thratsu okay this is all in line with what I'm reading in my book so it looks like it is um this is actually one that I'm not sure I haven't read about that in the book but anyways so it does look like it's being accurate um although I wish this was a little bit more I do I like the the that it it seemed like it produced a little bit more when it was a list so what let's see if we give it a clue um yeah Shinto is the largest with over 100 million follow your followers located in the city ize um first and then if we do this again um see but this isn't everything that you know right like I said I asked for detailed research notes I need to write everything I know and it gives me six bullet points really really um okay that's fine but one thing that's interesting is it seems like into means the way of the Gods it almost seems like I can just run it a few times and it will give me different outputs each time so maybe for this section we just run it a couple times actually this seems like it's working okay yeah okay all right so probably what we'll do is just break the sections down and then we will um we'll run this where we're asking for notes on each section we'll run it a couple times um to kind of get a little bit more out of it out of the machine um that seems like it's working okay-ish um okay so then we'll do request and then we'll do um section [Music] and then we'll just leave this open-ended so it might produce a paragraph it might produce a list okay so we'll do prompt research um actually here we'll do section research and so what this is doing just to take a step back and tell you like okay what is what is this actually doing so one misconception that people have is whether or not gpt3 is pulling from a database or searching the internet or what how is it how is it doing all this and so all this information is embedded in the neural network and so what we're doing is we're writing a prompt to pull that information out of the neural network and so the this works in a similar fashion to how human brains work and that our all of our knowledge and memories is implicit in the array of Connections in our brain and so with the right input or the right and sometimes the input can come from inside of our own brains like if you're sitting there thinking like I need to think about everything I know about Japan you can kind of you know trace the dots you can connect the dots and get you know kind of pull out memories from your own brain and we're doing the same thing here we're we're breaking apart that that cognitive process of okay let me think through about everything that I know about this um and so that's what we're doing deliberately um okay so we got this section um brainstorm some facts or things to include uh let's see you'll just repeat repeat this like two or three x times um and so then what then what we'll do is this is actually working better than I thought okay so we'll say we'll copy out some of this information and run it a couple times [Music] estimated 4 million followers see that's something where it's like 100 million and now there's four million like okay so we don't know if it's accurate but this could also be a benefit of running running it a few times yeah oops what just happened [Music] how did I do that current editor there we go okay so that's three iterations let's go for four because it seems like if you get four or first codified in the 8th Century CE according to the book I'm reading that is not true Japan didn't have written language until after the fourth Century a d c e so it couldn't have been codified and it's saying 4 million again so we will do fact checking in another video okay um all right I have compiled research notes um I have compiled the following research notes I need to rewrite these notes into um into a long professional blog post it must be engaging and interesting and so then we'll do research and then we'll do um [Music] engaging blog post and so basically all I'm going to do is take each of those sections do some research some internal brainstorming research and then we'll we'll generate a post on each of those sections [Music] now one thing is that will be that it that it will tend to do is it'll have these like little like sign offs right and it's like okay I don't want I don't want that but but we might have to deal with that okay anyways we'll probably can probably fix that at the end actually so let's go ahead and just copy this out okay um so do research and then engaging blog post and so this will be prompt um this will be uh section Pros so we're actually producing a final product at this point um yeah I think I think we're almost done because then we got the actual sections iterate and improve ah okay so yeah I like that um so if we if we take this we might need a second um okay yeah yeah this will actually work out well um I think I've got it all saved here yeah okay so then we'll just copy this here I wonder what will happen if I just say like let's see I've compiled I need to rewrite the notes into a long professional blog post it must be engaging I have the first draft of the post now I need to um improve on it okay so then we'll say um first draft oh hang on my dog's barking I gotta go see what he's barking at okay sorry about that um all right yes so first draft and then we'll just add some new lines and do second draft and you see like this this is getting long but one we've broken it down into sections um so we don't have to write the whole blog post at once and you see it's only a thousand tokens um so we're only at a quarter of our of our maximum um okay look at this Shinto believes in practices were first brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants I don't know that that's accurate but we see that this has this has gotten a little bit better um it's definitely integrating a little bit more of the information whether or not this information is factually accurate is

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. It is the largest religion in the country, with over 100 million followers. Shinto means "the way of the gods" and is based on the belief that everything in nature has a spirit.

Shinto has a long history in Japan, with the first records of the religion dating back to the 8th century CE. However, some scholars believe that the religion may have originated even earlier. Shinto is closely tied to the history and culture of Japan, and many of the country's most important landmarks and festivals have a Shinto connection.

One of the most important aspects of Shinto is the concept of kami. Kami are spirits that are present in all aspects of nature, and they can be either good or bad. People who follow Shinto believe that it is important to venerate the kami and to live in harmony with them.

There are many different Shinto shrines and temples located throughout Japan. The most important of these is the Grand Shrine of Ise, which is dedicated to the sun goddess Amaterasu. Other important shrines include the Shrine of Izumo, which is dedicated to the god of marriage, and the Shrine of Kasuga, which is known for its beautiful wisteria flowers.
