The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone let's do some philosophy with gpt3 what is a simple definition of nihilism that's my favorite topic like uh lately nihilism is the belief that nothing has meaning or value lovely what is a simple definition of humanism humanism is a philosophy that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings individually and collectively and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence rationalism and empiricism over established doctrine or faith feedism i don't know how to pronounce that okay so um i like these two things i am personally a humanist i um nihilism is a poison that is poisoning society as much as we don't think it is it is still prevalent um okay so uh let's see what is a simple definition of objective morality objective morality is a system of morality that is independent of human opinions or feelings okay as opposed to see what it says subject immorality is a system morality that is based on human opinion and our feelings okay i guess so um let's see uh from a cosmic perspective is life special interesting if even a tiny fraction of those stars have planets and that support life then there must be billions of planets with life in the universe what if earth is the only planet with life ah no i did not ask you to do that let's see in that case life would still not be special from a cosmic perspective the universe is so vast and old that even if earth is the only planet with life it is a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things okay i mean i guess that's a that's a nihilistic perspective um let's see um if life is unique to earth and life is the only thing um actually no here let me there's another question i need to ask first does life give meaning without life there can be no philosophy no meaning is this statement true or false why the statement is true life gives meaning to existence okay so so without life [Music] everything is meaningless pointless yes without life everything is meaningless okay therefore we can um [Music] can we therefore accept it as axiomatic that life is intrinsically valuable yes we can accept dot dot dot it's processing that life is intrinsically valuable because without it everything is meaningless does this run contrary to nihilism no it does not nihilism is the belief that life is meaningless and that there is no inherent value in anything uh but it just said that life is intrinsically valuable okay so the in this case i will say that uh that this is gpt3 failing at verbal reasoning um it's not perfect let's run it again this statement simply reaffirms that belief okay i disagree i think it is um okay let me rephrase it because so here's here's one thing where like if you and i were having a conversation and we can link those ideas um gpt3 sometimes seems to you know lose the plot okay if we accept that life is intrinsically valuable because it gives everything meaning then does this run contrary to nihilism okay but if this is like self-referential nihilism is the belief that life is ultimately meaningless however this does not mean that life cannot give meaning to existence in the meantime but if okay i think this is self-referential in non nonsense but whatever um gpt3 was trained on a lot of internet and there's a lot of edgy boys out there who who believe in nihilism so i think this is wrong but we can accept that life is intrinsically valuable because without it everything is meaningless um okay uh let's see um let me pause this for a second okay i know where to proceed let's see so without it everything is meaningless pointless okay what other axioms can we derive from this idea that life is intrinsically valuable uh let's see all life is valuable all living things have a purpose all life is interconnected and all life is sacred okay sacred is a pretty powerful word okay please expound upon these four assertions um let's see all life is valuable this means that all life is worthy of respect and care all life has inherent worth and dignity all living things have a purpose this means that everything that lives has a reason for existing all life is a part of a greater whole and has a role to play in the universe all life is interconnected this means that all life is connected to each other and to the rest of the universe we are all part of one big family all life is sacred this means that all life is holy and should be treated with reverence and respect okay this is really interesting i don't i think this is um this is kind of getting a little hand wavy so let me um let's see write a uh rigorous philosophical defense of the above assertions there we go okay so this shows that like you have to be really careful with your wording with gpt3 okay rigorous philosophical defense all life is valuable this assertion is based on the idea that life is intrinsically valuable without life everything is meaningless therefore all life is valuable because it gives meaning to existence there we go okay so that's referring back to itself correctly all living things have a purpose this assertion is based on the idea that all life is valuable since all life is valuable all living things must have a purpose this purpose may be different for each individual thing but all living things have a reason for existing yeah it's a little bit weak all life is interconnected all life is valuable since all life is valuable it is interconnected that's a non-sequitur um okay so i don't think i don't think it succeeded in defending this this point um let's see rigorous philosophical attack of the above assertions oh look at this this is great all life is valuable this assertion conflates the value of life with the value the value of life with the value of individual lives it is possible to be to value life without valuing all individual lives and vice versa i really like that all living things have a purpose this assertion is teleological and thus presupposes a purpose for existence it is not clear what this purpose is or why all living things would have the same

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

All life is valuable. This assertion is based on the idea that life is intrinsically valuable. Without life, everything is meaningless. Therefore, all life is valuable because it gives meaning to existence.

All living things have a purpose. This assertion is based on the idea that all life is valuable. Since all life is valuable, all living things must have a purpose. This purpose may be different for each individual thing, but all living things have a reason for existing.

All life is interconnected. All life is valuable. Since all life is valuable, it is interconnected. This means that all life is connected to each other and to the rest of the universe. We are all part of one big family.

All life is sacred. This means that all life is holy and should be treated with reverence and respect.
