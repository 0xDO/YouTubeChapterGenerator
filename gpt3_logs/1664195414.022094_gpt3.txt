The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: so you might be thinking like okay well is this really going to add any value let's wait and see um because sometimes when you assess a situation um it's you're you're sometimes just going to restate what you've read um but in other cases there's actually going to be really um there's going to be some some good insights and also like we can we can fine-tune these these assessments over time right because in some cases you're going to have to ask different questions like what is the implication here let's see so basically this restates the problem rachel is feeling invisible this is likely causing her to feel overwhelmed and stressed so there's some inference in order to improve the situation rachel and her husband need to communicate better see there we go so we're getting we're getting some actual information from this so let's go ahead and just save this as the initial assessment prompt so copy that out here so we'll do context so the context you you'll see is the same same thing here and then we'll remove this but yeah so rachel needs to explain um to her husband why she is feeling overwhelmed and stressed that's great um and her husband needs to listen to her so this is this is very imperative like if you say you need to do this that's kind of absolute thinking that's not exactly what we're looking for in the long run but again we can we can fine tune this over time so we will save this under here as to comparatives and we will call this prompt assessment so this is just the first bluff um let's plug in um let's see if we can get back to do to do okay it's not going to um let's grab just another random one see i've got 500 of these so eventually i'm going to um automate this right one day employees of a medium-sized company arrive at work to find that the entrance has been blocked off by a large truck the truck is filled and the driver is nowhere to be found um the uh they're trying to find another way because they're late for their morning meeting somebody's president is not happy about the situation so you can see this is kind of like middle of the road right like this is causing several people to stress um but it's not the end of the world either okay so let's plug this context into our um into our assessment prompt and see what happens because this might tell us to give us some insight as to how can we how can we make this prompt a little bit better um okay so it's basically restating it um the five w's are who what where when okay um wanted something a little bit more inference um let's see uh make insightful inferences about this uh this scenario all right so let's try this again because we don't want it to just restate something we want to actually gain information we want to gain insight from it okay okay so this is still just restating stuff um write a detailed paragraph or two about um let's let's cut out the five w's because that's that's two that's too prescriptive um let's see let's just say evaluating this situation make insightful inferences about the scenario um because what's the goal here we want to the the purpose here is to communicate um to extract meaningful information about this the goal is to extract meaningful information about this situation so that decisions and so that planning and decisions can be made okay so let's see if this helps oh there we go so it's kind of restating it but not just not just um so it's like the some the company is facing a major situation all right and it is causing the company to lose money okay so there we go it's inferring like this is the actual problem the president is right to be concerned about the situation and he needs to find to get away to the right of the sorry and needs to find a way to get rid of the truck as soon as possible the employee should continue to search for the driver and they should also call the police again to see if they can help in the meantime the company should consider hiring a security guard to keep an eye on the situation and make sure the truck does not cause any more problems um this is better but it doesn't kind of explain why or or speculate as to why um um let's see make insightful inferences about the scenario i think that that is too vague let's say instead of insightful inferences let's say infer causes infer or speculate about um [Music] causes and outcomes in this scenario because that like if you say okay if like if i just say like infer insights that's like okay what does that really mean but really what we want is how did we get here why and so speculating about causes that says oh you want me to tell you how this happened let's figure out why this happened but then also saying we want us we want to speculate about outcomes so let's run this again and see if this prompt is a little bit better the company is losing productivity and money because its employees are not able to get to work the president is also not happy if they are able to find the driver however the driver is not found the company may have to close its doors for good i don't think it's that bad um let's see let's simplify this speculate about causes and outcomes let's just simplify this often simpler is better the outcome could have been much worse you know i'm almost liking the original prompt better assess the situation yep um let's see describe what's going on in a detailed paragraph or two evaluating um this scenario speculate about um maybe because we don't we don't want it to just describe it we want it to um we want it to really evaluate uh evaluate what's happening why and why uh predict what um possible outcomes there are there we go so anticipation is a really critical human ability so maybe that's what i was missing situation for the company is not ideal the employees are already behind their work and the president is not happy uh the company will lose money because the situation and the president is likely to be even more unhappy this the employees are doing their best to find the driver um the police are

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The company is losing productivity and money because its employees are not able to get to work. The president is also not happy. If they are able to find the driver, however, the driver is not found, the company may have to close its doors for good. The outcome could have been much worse. The situation for the company is not ideal. The employees are already behind their work and the president is not happy. The company will lose money because of the situation, and the president is likely to be even more unhappy. The employees are doing their best to find the driver. The police are also called to try to find the driver. In the meantime, the company should consider hiring a security guard to keep an eye on the situation and make sure the truck does not cause any more problems.
