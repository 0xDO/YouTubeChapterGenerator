The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: is this is the agent model right here um and this could be anything right um you could say i'm a duck what should i do and gpt three can can tell you actually let me just show you what i mean by agent model um so let's duplicate this tab um i am a duck what should i do [Laughter] um or if you say like um i am superman uh you know what should i do um so basically gpt3 is able to engage with any agent model and so what i'm doing here is i'm giving it a very specific agent model of identity and purpose identity purpose and abilities those are three of the key ingredients of um of of having an agent model um given um given these abilities um oh well here we'll just say what should i do right now the most important thing to do right now is find out um once we okay so it's still stuck in we i don't like this uh let's see actually you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna i'm gonna have another step um to simplify this um so what i'll do is we'll say read the entire following scenario and write a very detailed summary okay so this would actually probably be um like the final step of discernment or something to prepare it before putting it into the agent model but summarization is such a common thing i'm not going to um add that as a step um oh i might change my mind later but we'll see we'll see how this performs so let's um detailed summary all right so i will copy my agent model right here all right i don't necessarily like this summary let's turn the temperature down and try again okay there we go let's let it finish it got cut off here we go in most cases the police will be able to help resolve the situation okay so let's copy this this is this is kind of compressing all of the um everything up to this point into a single chunk of text okay so now so here's here's one thing is that the sometimes the first thing that gpt3 reads affects its output the most um so what we what we do when we get to the point of agent model is we should actually i remember this and i apologize i should have said this up front so if you put the agent model up front that kind of frames what the task is so i am involved in the following scenario and so then we um copy the scenario scenario and so they do this and then we say um what should i do um i'm involved within the scenario i need to decide what to do next okay so now let's see what it does okay it's not it's still not adopting the eye i want it to adopt the eye this worked better when i was testing it i promise it could be because this is so long um what should let's see let's do what should i do as an individual robot it's just kind of repeating itself okay when it worked it was usually um it was usually a shorter um a shorter uh uh thing um kind of a shorter scenario i'm wondering if there's if there's too much information and it's kind of getting lost um let me try an older instruct series model davinci instruct beta let's just see what happens investigate the truck to see what the situation is that's not so bad okay so if with this output the robot says i'm going to go investigate the truck um i'm not happy with that let's do a time check we are at 36 minutes all right unfortunately this is the last step so let's turn up the temperature and see what happens get information what should the company's robot do get information then decide that's not helpful um let's see what happens if we just switch to original davinci so the original models are more creative oh here we go look at this okay so one problem with the original da vinci is it just tends to keep running on and yammering on and on okay what should i as an individual what should i do as an individual robot ask the delivery truck driver what the situation is find someone who knows the owner of the delivery truck call the owner of the delivery truck and tell them they need to retrieve the truck oh look at that very clever call someone in charge at that company because obviously a delivery truck isn't operating on its own call someone in charge of the company and coordinate a plan of action with them call the police and report the truck move the truck out of the way um wow okay so i think the moral of the story here is that i'll need to do more work with original da vinci because it's just way more creative and it's actually way smarter but then it just it tends to like run you know run off um these are all going to be fine-tuned models in the long run each of these steps assessment will recall is going to be a system outside of gpt3 ideation discernment and agent model these are all going to be fine-tuned so that each of these will be purpose-built rather than using specific da vinci um okay so i'm actually really happy with that final result so i will i will save this as let's just say agent and then scenario whoops scenario we will save this as um scenario so the scenario is when everything is summarized together excuse me um what should i do as an individual robot and then so we'll save this and we'll save this as prompt agent i probably should have a summary i didn't save that one did i um summarizing is pretty straightforward um but there you have it so here is whoops that's not what i meant to click on um so this is this is the general process of like a uh let's say a loose approximation of what happens in your head when you're deciding what to do now there's a different kind of loop because this is this is this is a loop that's about intending to act but there's also uh like um daydreaming right um or mind wandering which is where you're thinking without any intention to act so we'll get to that in the future but this is all of the cognitive control that goes up to making a decision to do something and i will call it there so thanks for watching and have a good day

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The agent model is a way of thinking about what you should do in a given situation. It involves three key elements: identity, purpose, and abilities.

In most cases, the police will be able to help resolve the situation. However, if you are involved in a situation where the police cannot help, you will need to use your own judgment to decide what to do next.

One way to do this is to read the entire scenario and write a very detailed summary. This will help you to identify the most important points and make a decision about what to do next.

If you are unsure about what to do, you can always call someone in charge at the company or the police and coordinate a plan of action.
