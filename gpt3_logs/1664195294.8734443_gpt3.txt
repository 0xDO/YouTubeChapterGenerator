TRANSCRIPT: the implications um let's see uh given the following situation um uh deduce short-term and long-term long-term implications yeah we should short-term long-term um what can we expect or anticipate because of this situation and the proposed actions okay let's see write a detailed paragraph about the above situation um the potential ramifications and expected outcomes of these actions okay so your brain automatically anticipates the possible outcomes of anything that you're considering doing like you know um in a previous video someone i talked about how like you have um you have uh canonical neurons that every time you see something like i see my phone my brain immediately says oh i can grab that phone and one commenter said i see a fork and i think i can throw that fork that's true um your brain explores all kinds of possibilities but it also automatically um thinks about what is going to be the outcome if i pick up a fork and throw it my brain is also anticipating that fork's going to go sailing through the air um so what we also want to do is have our artificial cognitive entity automatically make those inferences as well and i promise this is it let's see in the event of a fire alarm going off while a robot is helping its owner make dinner the robot should first check the stove and oven um let's see okay it's just kind of repeating itself the potential ramifications of a fire alarm going off while a robot is helping its owner make dinner include the robot's owner being inconvenienced or in the worst case the robot's owner is being injured or killed yes we want we want it to be consciously thinking like okay this is a possible outcome here the expected outcomes of the of the actions the robot should take in this situation or that the robot's owner will be able to safely continue making dinner or in the worst case the robot's owner will be able to safely evacuate the premises perfect okay we're going to end this on a high note so i'm just going to copy this and we're just going to say like context and we're going to save this as prompt ramifications okay so i'm going to call that a day when we come back we're going to work on actually implementing these prompts into this spooling them all up and generating generating the next cognitive tasks so this is going to be this is where the rubber really meets the road because these prompts that i just wrote these are all going to happen every time regardless of whatever else is going on but what we're going to explore next time is meta prompts so we're basically going to get gpt3 to write our next prompts um and uh i know that that's a bold claim like like zaya said like borderline insanity um it is what it is that's what we got to do if we want to achieve general intelligence if we want to achieve artificial cognition that's that's where the order lies so anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe i hope you enjoyed this and found it illuminating um catch y'all next time

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The potential ramifications of a fire alarm going off while a robot is helping its owner make dinner include the robot's owner being inconvenienced or, in the worst case, the robot's owner is being injured or killed. Yes, we want we want it to be consciously thinking like okay this is a possible outcome here. The expected outcomes of the of the actions the robot should take in this situation or that the robot's owner will be able to safely continue making dinner or in the worst case the robot's owner will be able to safely evacuate the premises. Perfect. Okay, we're going to end this on a high note. So I'm just going to copy this and we're just going to say like context and we're going to save this as prompt ramifications. Okay, so I'm going to call that a day. When we come back, we're going to work on actually implementing these prompts into this, spooling them all up and generating generating the next cognitive tasks. So this is going to be this is where the rubber really meets the road because these prompts that I just wrote these are all going to happen every time regardless of whatever else is going on but what we're going to explore next time is meta prompts. So we're basically going to get GPT3 to write our next prompts. I know that that's a bold claim like like Zaya said like borderline insanity. It is what it is. That's what we got to do if we want to achieve general intelligence if we want to achieve artificial cognition. That's that's where the order lies. So anyways, thanks for watching. Like and subscribe. I hope you enjoyed this and found it illuminating. Catch y'all next time.
