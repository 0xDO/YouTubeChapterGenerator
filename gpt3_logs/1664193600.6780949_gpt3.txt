The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: familiar you are with a problem the more you can rely on your intuition so i for instance if you watch some of my other videos where i'm just like my intuition says you know interact with gpt3 this way it's because i'm drawing on those past experiences i have a lot of knowledge embedded about how to interact with gpt3 i've also got a lot of knowledge embedded about neuroscience which also helps so by basically embedding a lot of facts and patterns then you can you can rely more heavily on recall intuition or heuristics and i apologize my eye's a little dry travesties of waking up and working it stupid early in the morning okay intuition is thought to be particularly useful in situations where we need to make a quick decision such as in an emergency overall intuition is a powerful tool that can help us make better decisions but it is important to be aware of its limitations we should not rely on intuition alone so there's a book called thinking fast and slow which yeah i don't like the book it's super dry and and he yeah but the idea here that stands is that you have different modes of thinking um we should not rely on intuition alone okay etc etc um so intuition uh heuristics not neuristics heuristics so this is basically going to be an identical definition heuristics are mental shortcuts that humans can use to make decisions sounds really familiar doesn't it let's see blah blah blah blah i'm going to cut it off there i'm not going to read that whole thing we often use heuristics when we do not have time to think through all of the options or when we do not have enough information to make a completely informed decision doesn't that sound like intuition heuristics can lead to both good and bad decisions the study of heuristics is important for understanding how humans make decisions heuristics can help us to understand why people sometimes make irrational decisions yes the idea that humans are rational actors that economists love is patently absurd humans we all use shortcuts and so if you've got bad training data as a human you will make bad decisions just like artificial intelligence so in that respect artificial intelligence is just like actual intelligence um heuristics can also help us to design better syst decision-making systems okay so the fact again we're coming back to the fact that um the gbt3 is just impulsive it is 100 instinct it's just saying okay you gave me this task i'm going to spit this out so that means in order to in order to make use of intuition heuristics recall cognitive control we need to build all kinds of systems around a model like gpt3 because it doesn't have any of that so that's why i say like i don't think we're ever going to achieve agi or artificial cognition with a single model um i it there there might be there might be models that we can embed cognitive control later on um but you still need to have recall from other storage systems uh working memories task sets that sort of stuff and so i don't i don't think i don't think that it even makes sense to have a single model because the brain has dedicated structures to handle different kinds of tasks right emotional processing happens in a dedicated model a dedicated region impulse control happens in another dedicated region right visual processing happens in another dedicated region so the fact that the brain is composed of these these fine-tuned parts to borrow a gpt3 term i think that in order to achieve full agi we're going to need a bunch of different models so multi-modal cognition right and then the system that you use to plug those multimodal systems together is where i would that's where i come in as an artificial cognition researcher um okay i'm running out of steam i think we hit all the big ones yeah okay that's it we we hit up we hit them all okay so this has been your impromptu midnight lesson in large language models gpt3 and the neuroscience of artificial general intelligence or artificial cognitive entities thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed and learned something and catch you next time

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Intuition is a powerful tool that can help us make better decisions. However, we should not rely on intuition alone. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that humans can use to make decisions. The study of heuristics is important for understanding how humans make decisions. Heuristics can help us to understand why people sometimes make irrational decisions. Heuristics can also help us to design better decision-making systems.
