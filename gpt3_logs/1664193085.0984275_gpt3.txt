The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: the um for the why is my brain so scattered lately um because it's super early and I haven't been getting as much sleep as I need um yes so by having a fine-tuned model that will reliably kind of integrate whatever is in one scene and Carry It Forward I can then use that as a launching point to integrate multiple uh other models whether it's prompts or fine-tuned models such as an event simulator or a character POV simulator but what it will do is it will reliably integrate all that information that exists here and then spit out the next scene and so that way you kind of have a bunch of things that kind of funnel into one one event or one um one step one instance and then it generates a new scene and then you can take that new scene and um integrate more stuff into it so that's my that's my hypothesis so I'll go ahead and pause it again um we're at uh let's see 300 so we're about halfway done generating um the initial scenes okay I'm kind of bored uh watching this go 450 out of I think 660 so about two-thirds of the way done um all right so I'm thinking about the scene simulation this is going well um but I want to go ahead and start um character simulation as well so we'll just do um character simulation and so this is going to be uh like stream of Consciousness slash interiority simulation for fictional characters um Okay add readme and then license will be MIT create repo and then we'll come in here and grab this all right so in this case what are we going to do for the character simulation um let me go ahead and do this and character Sim and we will copy over um some of the stuff from here get ignore and then open Ai and then we'll do um generate scenes okay just instantiate this new one um all right so character Sim gpt3 logs and then all right so what goes into interiority right so if we look at um if we look at some of the scenes right Sandy sat on the edge of the mat this is kind of like the camera is looking at a person and it's like you know you might have some interiority right so like Sandy's watching her children play she loved this quiet beach so that's that's a little bit of of in her head right but in order to really write fiction you as the right as the as the author need to be simulating what is in someone's head um so let's just grab this and go over to the playground oh so I brought this up um uh generating synthetic data is way more affordable now um because uh look at this I've got 500 requests and it's three dollars so that's a lot of synthetic data um anyways let's go back to the playground all right so um let's see uh um rewrite no um so we'll say scene it'll say uh let's see imagine um the POV of the characters here um of the of the main main character we'll say main character because some of these have multiple characters um imagine the POV of the main character um right their stream of consciousness Consciousness there we go um or interiority um scene um for this scene uh okay so we're basically just going to take a scene and then translate it into interiority um so let's do interiority let's see if this works okay it's just repeating it um I don't think I don't think it I don't think it's sophisticated enough to understand what I mean by interiority um what if we do let's see rewrite the following scene into the main character's POV um focus on interiority and stream of consciousness um interiority and stream of consciousness it doesn't know how to do that um because what we what we'd want to say is like rewrite it into first person um actually yeah let's let's just do rewrite the following scene into the main characters first person view okay rewrite as first person now that's interesting okay yeah I like this I like this okay so what we're doing is we're just reframing it um so it's instead of instead of watching it from the outside we're saying I um okay so this is good this is a good start so let me go ahead and save this as a prompt um so we'll say scene and so then we'll come back out here to character Sim and we'll do um prompt first uh okay but we need a little bit more right because a scene um is is good and it implies things about someone but we also want to have uh something about the characters uh beliefs so for instance when you when you write a character there's a bunch of stuff that goes into making a good character right so what goes into making a good character here let me zoom in a little bit um well here let's just do this um what makes a good character um write some uh let's see brainstorm some key features of good characters for um fiction authors okay that's this is um not key features write some uh detailed features foreign there we go all right good character is believable and relatable has a clear motivation well-rounded and has both positive and negative quality so undergoes believable development in the course of their story so that's good um so to put it in other terms you might have a character has a past right a past or backstory people don't just pop into existence um so we'll say people don't just pop into existence um a character has uh beliefs um let's see about themselves the world Etc um a character has preferences because basically you're not describing characters you're describing people right um likes dislikes Etc um let's see a character has motivations and goals what do they want today tomorrow from life um a character has connections connections friends family Etc so basically what I want to do is let's figure out how to stimulate these characters um so let's take let's just copy whoops copy this real quick and we'll do all right so we got some characters uh or some some some things to aim for right actually here this makes sense to store in the readme um what makes a good character my character is just a fictional fictional person what uh um what traits do do interesting people have so copy this um yeah so we'll replace that with a good character all right so we'll just save that real quick okay so we can translate a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

What makes a good character? This is a question that every fiction author must ask themselves. A good character is believable and relatable, has a clear motivation, is well-rounded and has both positive and negative qualities, and undergoes believable development in the course of their story.

People don't just pop into existence - a character has a past or backstory. A character has beliefs about themselves, the world, etc. A character has preferences, likes and dislikes, etc. A character has motivations and goals - what do they want today, tomorrow, from life? A character has connections - friends, family, etc.

In order to create believable and relatable characters, we must understand how to stimulate these qualities. One way to do this is by taking a scene and translating it into the main character's first person view. This allows us to focus on the interiority and stream of consciousness of the character, making them more believable and relatable.
