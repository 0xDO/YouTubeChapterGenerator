0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:27:05.400,0:27:12.180
in the programming language World there is the
concept of curing completeness a language that can
0:27:12.180,0:27:18.300
express anything that the theoretical construction
of what is called the turing machine can do
0:27:21.480,0:27:26.580
and indeed programming languages try on purpose to
0:27:26.580,0:27:33.300
beat you incomplete and for people who
remember how ethereum began their main
0:27:35.280,0:27:40.920
goal was to have Smart contracts in
a language which is during complete
0:27:42.600,0:27:52.740
but during complete languages are undecidable
the task of asking questions about statements
0:27:52.740,0:27:56.160
including complete languages
in particular asking whether
0:27:56.880,0:28:02.760
two programs will return the same output but
the two problems are equivalent is undecidable
0:28:05.460,0:28:15.660
now um one thing that sometimes people neglect
is that you don't need to be curing complete
0:28:16.380,0:28:19.680
if you need your incompleteness
no more than I need shampoo
0:28:21.720,0:28:31.500
because Turing machines they are mathematically
equivalent to ordinary computers completely
0:28:31.500,0:28:37.620
except one point they have infinite memory are
equivalent to computers with infinite memory
0:28:39.120,0:28:43.440
so you are never going to have
real Turing machines anyway
0:28:45.540,0:28:51.420
and taking the example of arithmetic I
said before there are Infinity many numbers
0:28:52.740,0:28:57.780
but guess what only mathematicians care
that there are infinitely many numbers
0:28:57.780,0:29:03.720
there are but no one cares physics physicists
don't need them programmers don't need them
0:29:03.720,0:29:07.200
no one cares that there are Infinity many
numbers when did you ever run out of numbers
0:29:08.280,0:29:15.780
you don't care you don't need it it is true that
there are infinitely novels but you don't need it
0:29:18.180,0:29:26.700
I'm not going to say that the way we achieve the
side ability is by limiting The Machine's memory
0:29:26.700,0:29:31.860
or by assuming finitely many numbers we are doing
it differently we achieve the side ability while
0:29:31.860,0:29:41.820
maintaining the infinite but I am pointing out
that you don't need to go to undecidable languages
0:29:42.840,0:29:47.700
stay within the set of languages and
enjoy the decidability of being able
0:29:47.700,0:29:56.220
to get answers to your questions another
way to put it there is an algorithm that
0:29:56.220,0:30:02.340
gives answers to questions and decidability one
way to say it is to say there is no algorithm
0:30:03.780,0:30:08.880
you want languages with algorithms that
tell you whether something is true or false
0:30:12.900,0:30:22.380
Yeah by by just uh picking another side of the
argument of Ohad this is important to have a
0:30:22.380,0:30:28.020
decidable language with an algorithm that actually
exists and then terminates which has to be correct
0:30:28.020,0:30:34.020
so in all the notion of disadability is based on
the fact you want an algorithm that does exactly
0:30:34.620,0:30:41.520
finds exactly a solution to your problem and
and maybe for that particular problem such an
0:30:41.520,0:30:47.220
argument terminates doesn't exist so now now we
want to have decidable languages anomaly that
0:30:47.220,0:30:54.000
the language for which such angle determinates
exists and this argument has to find the the
0:30:54.000,0:30:59.760
right the correct answer to your problem and the
only way to do that is not to let programmers in a
0:30:59.760,0:31:04.920
software house to build these programs but always
determinate but to employ mathematicians logicians
0:31:05.460,0:31:12.360
that generates algorithms with together with
a mathematical proof that this argument does
0:31:12.360,0:31:17.460
do the right thing and this algories terminate
and exactly with the right answer so I go back
0:31:17.460,0:31:23.820
to my very first statement about trust so if
you employ logic in this whole Endeavor you
0:31:23.820,0:31:28.440
actually guarantee that this the algorithms do
the right thing there is a theorem proving that
0:31:28.440,0:31:33.780
so you have not to worry about whatever
the computer tells back to you moreover
0:31:33.780,0:31:39.120
you can decide what the the process that
the computer takes to give you an answer
0:31:42.060,0:31:47.700
excellent thank you guys for that um that answer
this these topics are so fascinating to me and
