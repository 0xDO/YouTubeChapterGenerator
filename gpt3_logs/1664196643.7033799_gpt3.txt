the thing with dreams now granted there's lots of discussion about where dreams come from because our dreams random signals generated bouncing around in your own head or our dreams signals from from outside of our head right is it is that we're in an altered state of consciousness and we're actually getting messages from morpheus it's possible um but our eyes are not involved in dreams but we still see so how does that work so your eyes are closed your eyes are not not really um i'm dreaming all of you up don't worry uh all is well yeah um [Laughter] it's all just a dream um yeah so with dreaming and and and hallucinations your eyes are not involved but you can still get visual information um so one thing that's really interesting is um if you read about near-death experiences so i read life after life um even people who are blind when they have near-death experiences they can see and even if they were born blind they still get visual information about angels or demons or gods or whatever it is that they see when they're having their near-death experience um and the same is true of people that um were disabled like if they're missing limbs in life then their their their spirit body is complete and fully functional so you could you could easily make the argument oh well you just have a model in your brain of what it's like to have a fully functional body because we evolved to have fully functional bodies so there's some genetic memory in there but another possibility is that we are spirits and our spirit bodies are complete always um okay ancestor civilization seems to be a little uh anthropocentric let's see sorry there's multiple messages coming in ancestor civilization seems to be a little anthropocentric it's possible we are technological civilization maybe the simulations form a near infinite number of civilizations for technological inspiration yeah that's possible so that's another thing what if we're actually being simulated by like octopus people that'd be cool right like what if what if um there's a race of aquatic uh aliens what we would call them aliens and they're trying to come up with the best um genetic and and phenotype for land right because they found another planet but it's land and we're actually our purpose here in this simulation is for them to find the right bodies to use on earth right so they like maybe we are running in a simulation 80 light years from earth or eight maybe eight billion light years from earth because another race saw earth and they said oh we want to go there how do we terraform it what kind of life needs to be on there so maybe all the life that's in our on our planet if we are in the simulation is they're actually trying to predict exactly what organisms and and life forms that they'll need to seed earth correctly and you know you take that out to a logical extension maybe we are on a seed ship right now that is preparing to seed earth with life and we're just the progenitors of that simulation and then old zany says personally i'm rather excited for sex robots we did evolve to be a rather horny species um as one uh i think it was an evolutionary biologist said uh sex is for making babies but that's not why we do it um the implication there is that we do it because it feels good and that's why we eat too right like you don't eat you know you don't ever consciously think like i'm going to eat or i'm going to starve to death unless you're actually starving but we eat because it feels good i made old zany do a uh a spit take you're welcome yeah so everything that we do and i'll tie this back to core objective functions in a second everything we do is we do it because it feels good um so one of the sections in my latest book symphony of thought actually talks about the stages of moral development and so children learn to behave well because they don't like being punished right they escape spankings or being put in time out or whatever so that feels bad right so they escape suffering and they go towards something that feels good which for children being praised and hugged and you know having having you know quality time with parents and siblings and aunts and uncles that feels good and so all of our behavior all of our moral development comes from the carrot and stick of of reward and punishment and that's why some people think that um that reinforcement learning is the way to get to artificial general intelligence i actually used to think that so my work started back in 2009 where i thought that the the right way to approach it was to actually do a combination of evolutionary algorithms that would reshape neural networks over time i did not realize how computationally expensive that would be at first but basically the idea was with the right reward function you would get a machine that would evolve to be smarter it turns out that's maybe how to do it but it would take millions and millions and millions of random generations to do it and i was like yeah i can't run this on a pentium 4 or whatever i had at the time let's see has anyone else messaged on another platform no not yet um check twitter uh yes there could be other civilizations but no way to get to them without a one-way trip yes correct um one-way trip or uh yeah any number of any number of barriers um preventing us from from getting to other folks um let's see okay escape the spanking d shapiro yes um well it depends on what you're into some people would not want to escape the spanking that's what you call a perverse incentive i get it double entendre okay anyways um getting a little bit a little bit mined in the gutter here but yeah so core objective functions so with the core objective functions that i've outlined um it's not like you can't spank a machine god that's another quotable one um you can't

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Entering a dream state is like flickering spots of incredible HD starting to sprinkle across my vision. Our eyes suck in comparison. Yes, dream study okay, so someone else. Um, yeah, so here's the thing with dreams now. Granted, there's lots of discussion about where dreams come from because our dreams random signals generated bouncing around in your own head or our dreams signals from from outside of our head? Right. Is it that we're in an altered state of consciousness and we're actually getting messages from Morpheus? It's possible. Um, but our eyes are not involved in dreams, but we still see. So how does that work? So your eyes are closed. Your eyes are not really. I'm dreaming all of you up. Don't worry. All is well. Yeah. Um, it's all just a dream. Um, yeah. So, with dreaming and and and hallucinations, your eyes are not involved, but you can still get visual information. Um, so one thing that's really interesting is um, if you read about near-death experiences. So I read life after life. Um, even people who are blind when they have near-death experiences, they can see. And even if they were born blind, they still get visual information about angels or demons or gods or whatever it is that they see when they're having their near-death experience. Um, and the same is true of people that um were disabled like if they're missing limbs in life, then their their their spirit body is complete and fully functional. So you could you could easily make the argument, oh well you just have a model in your brain of what it's like to have a fully functional body because we evolved to have fully functional bodies. So there's some genetic memory in there, but another possibility is that we are spirits and our spirit bodies are complete always. Um, okay, ancestor civilization seems to be a little anthropocentric. Let's see. Sorry, there's multiple messages coming in. Ancestor civilization seems to be a little anthropocentric. It's possible we are a technological civilization. Maybe the simulations form a near infinite number of civilizations for technological inspiration. Yeah, that's possible. So that's another thing. What if we're actually being simulated by like octopus people? That'd be cool, right? Like what if what if um there's a race of aquatic uh aliens. What we would call them aliens. And they're trying to come up with the best um genetic and and phenotype for land right because they found another planet but it's land. And we're actually our purpose here in this simulation is for them to find the right bodies to use on earth right. So they like maybe we are running in a simulation 80 light years from earth or eight maybe eight billion light years from earth because another race saw earth and they said oh we want to go there how do we terraform it what kind of life needs to be on there. So maybe all the life that's in our on our planet if we are in the simulation is they're actually trying to predict exactly what organisms and and life forms that they'll need to seed earth correctly. And you know you take that out to a logical extension. Maybe we are on a seed ship right now that is preparing to seed earth with life and we're just the progenitors of that simulation. And then old zany says personally i'm rather excited for sex robots. We did evolve to be a rather horny species. Um as one uh I think it was an evolutionary biologist said uh sex is for making babies but that's not why we do it. Um the implication there is that we do it because it feels good. And that's why we eat too, right? Like you don't eat you know you don't ever consciously think like i'm going to eat or i'm going to starve to death unless you're actually starving. But we eat because it feels good. I made old zany do a uh a spit take. You're welcome. Yeah. So everything that we do and i'll tie this back to core objective functions in a second everything we do is we do it because it feels good. Um so one of the sections in my latest book symphony of thought actually talks about the stages of moral development. And so children learn to behave well because they don't like being punished right? They escape spankings or being put in time out or whatever. So that feels bad right? So they escape suffering and they go towards something that feels good which for children being praised and hugged and you know having having you know quality time with parents and siblings and aunts and uncles that feels good. And so all of our behavior all of our moral development comes from the carrot and stick of of reward and punishment. And that's why some people think that um that reinforcement learning is the way to get to artificial general intelligence. I actually used to think that. So my work started back in 2009 where i thought that the the right way to approach it was to actually do a combination of evolutionary algorithms that would reshape neural networks over time. I did not realize how computationally expensive that would be at first but basically the idea was with the right reward function you would get a machine that would evolve to be smarter. It turns out that's maybe how to do it but it would take millions and millions and millions of random generations to do it. And i was like yeah i can't run this on a pentium 4 or whatever i had at the time. Let's see has anyone else messaged on another platform. No not yet. Um check twitter. Uh yes there could be other civilizations but no way to get to them without a one-way trip. Yes correct. Um one-way trip or uh yeah any number of any number of barriers. Um preventing us from from getting to other folks. Um let's see. Okay escape the spanking. D shapiro yes. Um well it depends on what you're into. Some people would not want to escape the spanking. That's what you call a perverse incentive. I get it. Double entendre. Okay, anyways. Um getting a little bit a little bit mined in the gutter here but yeah so core objective functions. So with the core objective functions that i've outlined. Um it's not like you can't spank a machine. God that's another quotable one. Um you can't.
