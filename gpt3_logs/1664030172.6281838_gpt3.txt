0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:27:01.980,0:27:06.960
all right yes so first draft and then we'll just
0:27:08.400,0:27:15.480
add some new lines and do second draft and you
see like this this is getting long but one we've
0:27:15.480,0:27:19.200
broken it down into sections um so we don't
have to write the whole blog post at once and
0:27:19.200,0:27:25.740
you see it's only a thousand tokens um so we're
only at a quarter of our of our maximum um okay
0:27:36.060,0:27:42.360
look at this Shinto believes in practices were
first brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants
0:27:46.500,0:27:53.280
I don't know that that's accurate but we see
that this has this has gotten a little bit better
0:27:55.080,0:28:00.180
um it's definitely integrating a little bit
more of the information whether or not this
0:28:00.180,0:28:03.480
information is factually accurate
is different so in a future version
0:28:03.480,0:28:10.680
I'll probably what I'll do is show you how to
integrate from a corpus of facts of of of like
0:28:11.640,0:28:16.860
other information rather than just relying
on confabulation and neural recall so this
0:28:16.860,0:28:22.080
when you ask when you ask gpt3 to just
barf out a bunch of facts that's called
0:28:22.080,0:28:29.340
neural recall and it can be pretty accurate
um but it can also be crazy wrong um Okay so
0:28:30.000,0:28:39.960
let's see what happens if we just do this
iteration a couple more times so it's just whoops
0:28:43.380,0:28:47.220
oh and it's just jumping down okay foreign
0:28:50.700,0:28:52.440
it's actually making it shorter
0:28:55.620,0:28:56.340
oh no
0:28:58.380,0:29:02.100
clarified it a little bit okay
0:29:04.320,0:29:11.100
okay so this this seems like it
works okay so let's add this as a um
0:29:16.740,0:29:19.680
so we'll do section
0:29:21.240,0:29:25.440
second draft and then we'll do this as
0:29:28.800,0:29:29.880
research
0:29:32.640,0:29:37.620
add a double new line there just to make it
nice and consistent and then we'll prompt
0:29:38.460,0:29:47.220
um uh excuse me Pros um I
actually do prompt improve Pros
0:29:48.000,0:29:51.120
and then we'll just Stitch it all
together and that's all programmatic
0:29:51.120,0:29:58.500
um okay fault temperature to 7 The Tokens to one
thousand because that's what we want all right
0:30:01.500,0:30:10.260
uh let's see yeah um well first
we need the uh the topic okay so
0:30:10.260,0:30:18.600
topic equals open file and we'll
do topic.txt so I will save that
0:30:21.120,0:30:25.260
here so save topic dot text
0:30:33.600,0:30:38.460
all right so we get the topic and then
the first thing we do is outline it
0:30:39.120,0:30:40.800
and then we improve the outline okay
