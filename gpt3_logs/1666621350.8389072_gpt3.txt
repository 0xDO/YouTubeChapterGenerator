0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:39:40.920,1:39:45.720
many many interesting challenges which does not
mean that we have problem these are these are
1:39:45.720,1:39:53.400
just new things we want to to add to the language
uh so that's okay so just levels of achievement
1:39:53.400,1:40:00.180
but no there's no technical hurdles preventing
you from moving forward at this point well or
1:40:00.180,1:40:08.100
are there details to be ironed out but yeah I
guess the main things are there yes excellent
1:40:09.840,1:40:17.400
and yes I agree indeed um you know ongoing effort
but we know mathematically that will never end
1:40:18.000,1:40:25.680
is to enhance the expressiveness of the language
and to have um a more efficient algorithms
1:40:26.880,1:40:32.340
okay so expanding expanding
expressions and optimization
1:40:33.240,1:40:38.700
um but as you said those those that will never end
that is just part of the ongoing work excellent
1:40:39.780,1:40:45.060
um as any final thoughts um you know one or two
sentences from from each of you any final thoughts
1:40:45.060,1:40:49.980
that you would like the world to know about Tau
before we uh we close our conversation for the day
1:40:51.660,1:40:55.560
well I can see my my perspective is a very uh
1:40:57.240,1:41:04.080
very focused on the technical aspect so I'm not
really the one that has the the the conquer in
1:41:04.080,1:41:09.420
the world and changing the world and pushing for
truth in the world from from that perspective I
1:41:09.420,1:41:16.080
really think that what we have done is really
magic is a major technical advances in logic
1:41:16.080,1:41:23.640
and computational logic and this gives the
company A major advantage business Advantage
1:41:23.640,1:41:28.920
too because we are the only owner so Tau the
company is the only owner of this technology
1:41:28.920,1:41:33.720
and so they they can do these things and nobody
still knows how they will get these results
1:41:34.800,1:41:42.240
and which is interesting as well so that's uh
and then yeah I really keep like to keep going
1:41:42.240,1:41:48.900
working on with the group and then to meet these
new challenges and extensions of the language
1:41:50.940,1:41:55.020
excellent thank you oh hard any any
final thoughts for uh for the world
1:41:57.900,1:42:03.960
um that's how to take it more than 12. we want
to take software development to the next level
1:42:05.580,1:42:09.600
that much more complex will be able to
be programmed and controlled by users
1:42:10.380,1:42:18.540
bring software back to the people wonderful
wonderful well thank you both so very much for
1:42:18.540,1:42:24.840
bringing me into the Tau group and having your
folks reach out this has been a remarkable set
1:42:24.840,1:42:30.720
of conversations leading up to this and I I get
chills just thinking about what it is that you're
1:42:30.720,1:42:37.020
doing and and and the the long-term implications
and just How Deeply fascinating and complex it is
1:42:37.020,1:42:43.860
so again thank you for for the The Talk today and
I look forward to continuing those conversations
1:42:43.860,1:42:52.860
and seeing where everything goes um so thank you
thank you to you thank you so much cheers cheers
