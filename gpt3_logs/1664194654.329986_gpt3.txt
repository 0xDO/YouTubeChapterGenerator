that can generate 292 billion different um arrays of appeal factors oh and also I can make it I can we can do even more let me show you because what I'm doing here um is with generate plot synopsies I'm just grabbing one of each of those you can get multiple tones multiple characters multiple storyline Styles and so on so yeah there's you can you can easily just continue to um to add add to this so like for instance um let's see settings uh let's see across the whole uh planet right so you just add one more thing because there's plenty of settings you can do there's plenty of time periods although I got I got pretty much all of you know from everything from ancient history Mythic period up through like far future uh distant future alternative timelines and so on um but yeah so I think I'll call it a day I'm very satisfied with this um this is uh clearly very useful um gets status get add kind of get commit am um all done so this is this is a very useful like you could you could also just call this a uh um a uh uh writing prompt right so

Styles

By adding a little bit more about style, you're going to get something a little bit better. Time periods and then tones so creepily creepy like unsetting in a visceral skin crawling way all right so we generated one uh black exploitation parity on another planet alternative timeline story type action-packed pulse pounding is the rule. Pace intensifying character introspective these characters examine their own feelings. Tone hopeful while addressing weighty issues these books incorporate some optimistic elements. Style gritty characterized by a narrative style that includes dark and unsettling details.

Um so then the appeal terms that's a big chunk beginning back on Earth in the early 21st century oh boy okay was a hugely popular movie fan franchise uh the film's chronicled the Adventures of the vampire Blacula who's from another planet. In the first film Blacula arrives on the earth and imposition by the evil dracul garage door opener company. What Blacula quickly realizes he is not welcome on Earth so he realizes that he's he returns to his home planet. Uh I might have thrown too much at it all right so superhero literature big city life um in the 17th century. World building uh Pace intensifying characters Twisted. Um let's see what else did we get um tone disturbing uh style dialect filled okay in a distant Galaxy I wonder why it said distant Galaxy that's fine um in a distant Galaxy an energy being known as the one has been narrowly defeated by a brave band of Heroes known as the Vanguard. I guess it does say superhero um it's fascinating and then World building okay um let's see let's see okay so it's just kind of regurgitating some of the stuff oh wait no that's those are the things that I told it to do okay the one unleashes his fury on the heroes killing all of them except for one an amnesiac girl who the heroes had rescued from a nearby Planet. Okay the caretaker um cool the girl who is who takes the name of Sarah quickly assimilates to life on Earth she soon discovers that she has superpowers okay so that's a cool origin story Sarah must find and rally the people of Earth to stop the one excellent um yeah Sarah travels back in time but it's too late the Vanguard has already defeated the one and about to kill the last remaining member um Sarah herself oh cool so it does it does integrate that time travel bit fascinating okay let's do this uh one more time and we'll call it a day um let's see science fiction England in the third Century um own voices um share marginalized uh identity pace is intensifying and character sarcastic um tone is explicit lots of vividly described sex okay that's pretty spicy um and then slang heavy Sabrina is a 20 something year old woman and lives in England during the third Century she eats out a living as a okay I'm not going to say that out loud um servicing Roman soldiers who are stationed nearby yeah okay um so this is one thing that I really don't like about uh about um the fine-tuned is that there's so many typos in the training data for gpt3 instruct that they end up in this and it's because it's because they paid a whole bunch of contractors to just generate a bunch of content um so anyways side tangent um let's see but they can help her Escape her current lifestyle if she's willing to work for him.

Okay so Sabrina is initially hesitant but the man is persistent and eventually agrees to work for him. He tells her that his name is Lucius and that he's a member of a secret society that is working to overthrow the Roman Empire. Now that's cool all right you got my attention. He tells her that they need someone with her knowledge of the city and the people in it to help carry out their plans. Oh this is this is uh some Espionage Sabrina is apprehensive but excited she agrees to help him and over the next few months becomes an invaluable asset to their cause. She helps them to gather information about the city and the people in it and who to trust she develops feelings for Lucius which complicates matters that's where it gets spicy eventually leads to the group downfall. Um Sabrina is captured and imprisoned oh wow everyone is executed that's horrible um and she thinks she wonders what she could have done to do make things differently she's executed and the Roman Empire continues to rule England for centuries to come wow okay that's really heavy um yep definitely intensifying um I guess I I yeah the the idea of Science Fiction was kind of overruled by everything else um but yeah okay that's yeah that's we've got we've got something that can generate some pretty intense plots here um and so then as I alluded to at the beginning of this I am writing uh or sorry working on a plot writing or a novel writing thing um but you need a premise to start you need that seed that kernel and so by having something that can generate 292 billion different um arrays of appeal factors oh and also I can make it I can we can do even more let me show you because what I'm doing here um is with generate plot synopses I'm just grabbing one of each of those you can get multiple tones multiple characters multiple storyline Styles and so on so yeah there's you can you can easily just continue to um to add add to this so like for instance um let's see settings uh let's see across the whole uh planet right so you just add one more thing because there's plenty of settings you can do there's plenty of time periods although I got I got pretty much all of you know from everything from ancient history Mythic period up through like far future uh distant future alternative timelines and so on um but yeah so I think I'll call it a day I'm very satisfied with this um this is uh clearly very useful um gets status get add kind of get commit am um all done so this is this is a very useful like you could you could also just call this a uh um a uh uh writing prompt right so
