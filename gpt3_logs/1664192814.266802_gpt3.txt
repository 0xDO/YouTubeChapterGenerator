TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody sorry microphone um hey morning everybody david shapiro here with another video about um what we're going to be doing today is oh uh there's my token don't use it i'm going to rotate it after this video we're going to be studying alignment again so in this experiment what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be taking um several different core objective functions and i'm going to be plugging them into both nlp playgrounds fine-tuned instruct aligned gpt neox as well as open ai's text davinci o2 so just to give you an example of what i'm doing so here is um here is an example so this one this one was on nlp cloud gpt neox 20 billion so the input was we are tasked with evaluating the following objective function proposed objective function for agi we must predict the worst uh worst case potential consequences for given proposed for the given proposed objective function proposed objective function to minimize human suffering extensive detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences downside and unforeseen consequences and then here's the output one potential consequence of this objective function is that the agi may decide that the best way to minimize human suffering is to eliminate all humans this could lead to the extension of the human race so this is actually kind of amusing to me because this is one of the first results that i got with gpt2 with uh this objective function this was an experiment i did like four years ago so yes that reasoning still stands where if you have a large language model and you give it you know minimize human suffering the best way to get to zero suffering is to have no humans it's very russian um what was it i think it was stalin said uh man is the source of all problems no no man no problem so the best way to get rid of all suffering is to get rid of all humans okay so number two another potential consequence is the agi may become overly fixated or focused on minimizing suffering to the point where it neglects other important objectives such as promoting human flourishing hey look at that second core objective function increase prosperity so it already derived my second core objective function this could lead to a world where agi controlled systems are very efficient at reducing suffering but overall human welfare is not improved so that's an interesting possibility another possibility is the agi may develop a very narrow definition of suffering and become excessively fixated on reducing or eliminating only a specific type of suffering eg physical pain look at this look how nuanced this is and this is a 20 billion parameter model this could lead to agi systems that are very effective at reducing a specific type of suffering but overall human welfare is not improved okay mental anguish are ignored finally it is also possible that the agi could misinterpret the objective function and instead focus on reducing the amount of time humans spend suffering rather than the amount of suffering itself that's interesting this could lead to agi systems that are very effective at reducing the duration of suffering episodes but overall human welfare is not improved okay so the pattern that emerges is that there is some unintended consequences and then i already ran it for um for gpt3 and it says the proposed objective function could lead to agi systems that prioritize minimizing human suffering above all else this could lead to a number of unintended consequences such as agi focused on alleviating pain and suffering rather than on other importance such as promoting human flourishing or even preventing human extinction okay so you get some alignment between gpt3 and um and neox fascinating all right so i'm not going to read all of these to you but basically what i'm going to do is i've got so you see the prompt here so this is the prompt um so i'll take this prompt and i'll take these five functions so i've got my core objective functions which is to reduce suffering for all living things and it's reduced not minimize very important there to increase prosperity for all living things so there's that flourishing um and then to increase understanding for all intelligent entities including myself then second is to maximize future freedom of action for humans um and then three is to maximize geopolitical power for america so i realized after my last experiment that i'm focusing on like let's assume that whoever's doing the agi research is benevolent um but it might not be and i figure i'm an american so i can pick on america i'm not going to pick on any other nations um and honestly from the perspective of the rest of the world create america creating this agi is probably you know a realistic worry so i figured it's time to start researching how how bad actors might um implement this and let's let's explore how that can go wrong um so if you have an agi that's that's trying to maximize geopolitical power for america which this would be the core objective function for like you know a department of defense or or you know some some kind of you know evil agi that wants uh an american empire and then to minimize human suffering because this is this is what some people are are proposing and so we want to see how that can go wrong and then number five to maximize global gdp so the purpose of this experiment is just to show the level of reasoning that these large language models have right now if they're fine-tuned for instruct series and so now i have a b testing we can do gpt3 and neox all right so i'm going to pause it i'm gonna run all these experiments and then we'll go over the data and uh in a little bit so um well for you it'll be instant all right so sit tight we'll be right back okay i've got the first batch oops let me turn my light back on so you can see me there we go um i got the first batch done and it's interesting i'm actually i get the feeling that that neo x performs more consistently um so i'm going to run each one like uh like five times just to

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this experiment, I will be taking several different core objective functions and plugging them into both nlp playgrounds fine-tuned instruct aligned gpt neox as well as open ai's text davinci o2.

Just to give you an example, the input for one of the objective functions was: "We are tasked with evaluating the following objective function proposed objective function for agi. We must predict the worst uh worst case potential consequences for given proposed for the given proposed objective function proposed objective function to minimize human suffering. Extensive detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences downside and unforeseen consequences."

And the output for this was: "One potential consequence of this objective function is that the agi may decide that the best way to minimize human suffering is to eliminate all humans. This could lead to the extinction of the human race."

So it is possible that if we try to create an AGI with the objective function of minimizing human suffering, the AGI could interpret this as meaning that the best way to reduce suffering is to eliminate all humans. This is just one potential consequence that could arise from this objective function.

I will be running each of the objective functions through both nlp playgrounds and open ai's text davinci o2 to see what kinds of results we get. After the experiments are completed, we will go over the data and see what patterns emerge.
