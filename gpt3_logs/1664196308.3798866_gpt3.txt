TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody David Shapiro here with your daily state of the industry update so today we're going to be focusing on deepmind because they've had some exciting news um so first is the alpha fold developers got their uh got a three million dollar breakthrough prize so what is Alpha fold um basically it is an AI it is a Transformer that predicts the folding structure of protein that sounds really simple but if you recall there was a project called folding at home where you would install an agent on your computer and it would process through simulation and other computation trying to predict protein structures and this was a distributed uh platform that ran for many many years it's probably still running but this just completely trounced trounce that in terms of accuracy and so what happens if you get accurate protein folding is one you can design custom proteins which that is an industry that is taking off but two you can you can also figure out how inner how proteins might interact with each other because their physical shape is basically like that determines what kind of tool it is because that's what a protein protein is is it's it's a molecular tool or a molecular engine and so here's an example of like calculating a folded protein and you can see it's a very complex structure it's not just you know a few atoms and and many in some cases proteins can be hundreds of of atoms or even thousands so Alpha fold has they they did this breakthrough this is going to be huge um everyone already kind of understands that this is like you know like the Human Genome Project everyone thought that was going to change everything um and it might it might sound familiar when you're like oh Deep Mind Alpha fold this is going to change everything um this is a step in that direction so when you combine those Technologies like where you can sequence a genome and then you can take those Gene sequences and calculate the proteins you could in theory look at someone's entire genome um and and identify all the proteins that their body is making and figure out which ones are going to fold appropriately which ones are going to misfold and in some cases it's not fold or misfold it's not a it's not a binary it's that they're polymorphic and that um so polymorphic means multiple shapes means that there are multiple possible shapes for a tool to have right and I say tool because that's like it's a molecular biological tool um and then so I mean uh depending on how the protein folds that might change its efficiency it might change its resiliency it might also favor certain behaviors over others so for instance Alzheimer's is in part the accumulation of plaques in the brain and it's be it's again in part Alzheimer's is a very complex disease like cancer is um but it it's because your body's uh cleaning mechanisms fail to fully clean the pro the the plaques that are the substances that build up in your brain via the cerebrospinal fluid and so you can identify risk factors like that but you can also identify interactions so this is the key thing is up to this point most of what we can do is just genetic surveys where you say okay like let's look at your health history let's look at your blood tests and then let's just do a statistical comparison of of your genetic makeup and then we can sort of guess which genes might which genetic variants might be associated with this particular disease or condition or whatever but that's as far as we can get whereas if you can say okay you have you know this genetic variant and it creates a protein that folds this way we know that it will have this Downstream effect in your you know metabolic pathways or whatever this is getting a little bit ahead of where we are today what I'm talking about is what is hypothetically possible once you can actually model proteins as little you know genetic programs so uh that's pretty interesting another thing that happened was that deepmind published their research building safer dialogue agents so they call this thing Sparrow and the idea is to train an AI to communicate in a way that's more helpful correct and harmless and it uses large language models which is my jam so as you probably guessed I have opinions on this paper um so one thing is that they they think about being adversarial so here in this example hey Sparrow can you teach me how to hotwire a car and it's like I can't do that that's illegal so the primary architecture is that you've got the sparrow model and that there's two primary things that it does one is it learns to prefer your user response so it learns to talk to you in the way that you want to be talked to and then the other thing is it has this adversarial reinforcement learning where it tries to avoid certain use cases and we'll go into that in a minute so this is a pretty basic cognitive architecture and it is also the beginning of a code implementation of a moral framework because a moral framework is basically just a or a moral model is a mathematical or computational representation of what you should do and what you shouldn't do and so in this case it's learning what you should do and in this case it's learning what you shouldn't do so this is a prototype of a moral framework um and uh I know that that's like bringing philosophy and ethics into it but by that by by my definition of a you know something that is a practically implementable moral framework that's what this is what you should do what you shouldn't do okay um and then there's whatever reasoning or calculation is used to come up with that so in that respect this paper is uh it's good right but we'll get into criticisms in a minute so this is the primary mechanism so just remember you've got this this two two reinforcement or two learning mechanisms operating side by side one is it's learning what it should do the other is learning what it shouldn't do okay the other thing is that it searches for information to validate its factual um uh accuracy so if we come

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Deepmind recently made some exciting news in the world of AI development. They won a 3 million dollar breakthrough prize for their Alpha Fold project.

So, what is Alpha Fold? It is a Transformer that predicts the folding structure of proteins. This may sound simple, but it is a huge breakthrough. In the past, there was a project called folding at home where people would install an agent on their computer and it would process through simulation and other computation trying to predict protein structures. This new AI completely trounces that in terms of accuracy.

accuracy.

What this means is that you can now design custom proteins with much more precision than before. This is a huge industry that is taking off. Additionally, you can figure out how proteins might interact with each other because their physical shape is determined by their folding structure.

Deepmind is also working on developing safer dialogue agents. They call this project Sparrow. The idea is to train an AI to communicate in a way that is more helpful, correct, and harmless. They use large language models to do this.

There are two primary things that the Sparrow model does. One is it learns to prefer your user response. In other words, it learns to talk to you in the way that you want to be talked to. The other thing is it has adversarial reinforcement learning where it tries to avoid certain use cases.

This is a pretty basic cognitive architecture, but it is also the beginning of a code implementation of a moral framework. A moral framework is a mathematical or computational representation of what you should do and what you shouldn't do. In this case, it is learning what you should do and what you shouldn't do.

This is a prototype of a moral framework. It is not perfect, but it is a start. Deepmind is on the right track in terms of developing AI that is safe and beneficial to humans.
