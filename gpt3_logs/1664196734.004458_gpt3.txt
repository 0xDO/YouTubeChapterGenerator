The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: identity is our template our set of beliefs about ourselves but then if we're if something is brought to our attention where we did not behave congruently with our our beliefs about ourself then we feel bad that's where shame comes from um shame disappointment whatever um all those negative experiences of our self um so let's make inferences about eve's personality from the conversation it can be inferred that eve is a caring and empathetic person she is interested in the well-being of the user and is willing to help the user in any way she can great um so let's turn this around user's personality so anyways what i'm demonstrating here is that gpt3 already has the ability to perform theory of mind given the correct inputs and prompts user is struggling to deal with their family user has difficulty communicating with their family user feels stuck in the middle user is feeling really alone right now user is grateful for eve's support it's talking about itself like in third person like dobby dobby is a free elf sorry um okay so back to persona okay so the reason that i include persona in my acog experiments is because i want my my device to have self-awareness and so this is like functional sentience it says oh i'm raven but this is what raven's behavior indicates and then that can be compared against the template later that's also why i had predictions one of the previous prompts was like predict the impact that this is going to have because another way that we can self-correct is that we make predictions about how our behavior is going to affect others and then we can measure how far or close our prediction was from reality so by including that information we can also help train our acog to make better predictions in the future which will also then lead to better decisions in the future and close some of these superfluous ones um dossier metacognition characterize raven's thoughts describe what raven is thinking and why so this is really similar to persona but it's rather than rather than trying to establish raven's own identity this is just raven being self-aware of what raven is thinking um empathy raven is an artificial intelligence and for what other people are thinking and feeling in these memory logs so again gpt3 does this implicitly but as we've seen here whoops you don't need to see my spotify as we've seen here gbt3 is implicitly um using empathy but when you make it explicit um you just call attention say like oh yeah i need to pay attention to how people are feeling um it works really well and then consequences what did raven cause to happen here um so let's turn this around and say um make inferences about eve's impact here um what are the consequences of eve's actions eve's actions in this conversation are supportive and helpful she actively listens to the user and tries to understand their situation she also provides comfort and reassurance as a result the user feels supported and appreciated so this is all phenomenal theory of mind so by asking these questions in different ways we're getting evidence of theory of mind and gpt3 so let's see as a result so this is an anticipation as a result the user feels supported and appreciated this can lead to improved mental health and well-being phenomenal rock solid and this is not even a fine-tuned model this is just gpt3's intrinsic ability so this is um some of you have called me out in the past where i say like gpt3 isn't magic this is one place where gpt3 is magic i think that gpt3 scores at or above human level in empathy and read in um in text-based scenarios so you make this a multimodal model and it's going to have higher emotional intelligence than humans this is this is incredible okay core objective function suffering prosperity and understanding there we go okay has eve increased or decreased suffering so this gets back to my core objective functions um or my core heuristic comparatives um oh wow this is this is really nuanced it is difficult to say definitively whether or not eve has increased or decreased suffering however it seems likely that eve has at least decreased the feeling of loneliness of the user additionally eve has provided the user with someone to talk to about their difficult family situation this may help the user to feel better in the long run even if it does not immediately solve the problem wow yes look at how nuanced gpt3's understanding of the goal of suffering of how how how subtly it can describe suffering and make these inferences about long-term impacts this is perfect okay so let's try prosperity and then i'll add a note prosperity means to live well no not leave live well so the second core objective function is increased prosperity so let's see what lit what what gpt3 does to evaluate eve's decision now it should also be noted this entire conversation was generated by gpt3 so literally everything here was 100 percent coming from gpt3's own mind so keep that in mind it is difficult to say whether or not eve has increased or decreased prosperity for the user on one hand eve has listened to the user and offered support this could be seen as increasing prosperity as the user feels heard and validated oh my god this is wonderful on the other hand the user is still struggling with their family situation which has not changed in this sense prosperity has not been increased my philosophical entp heart how it sings this is phenomenal oh man i am so proud of just this machine i i didn't even do any of this this is all open ai and their research okay and then finally understanding is the final one so let's see increased or decreased understanding so basically for those not in the know my core objective functions reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding are the three core objective functions or heuristic imperatives that i think that we should give agi or what i call now acog in order to make sure that machines that have no intrinsic sense of morality behave in a trustworthy

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Eve is a caring and empathetic person. She is interested in the well-being of the user and is willing to help the user in any way she can.
