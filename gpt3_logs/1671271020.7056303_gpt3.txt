0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:12:28.980,0:12:34.020
the next big thing in Computing and so what
they're going to do is they're focusing on
0:12:34.020,0:12:42.120
that and they have they have the money and the
expertise to to do it so I think that Quantum
0:12:42.120,0:12:48.960
Computing you know 2023 obviously uh it may
or may not be like commercially viable by then
0:12:49.860,0:12:56.040
um but I think that we're gonna see some really
good advancements on Quantum Computing in in 2023
0:12:56.760,0:13:03.780
we'll we'll have a better idea as to who's close
to who's closer to succeeding um again my money's
0:13:03.780,0:13:10.920
on IBM um time will tell so that's uh that's one
thing now the question is like okay so what like
0:13:10.920,0:13:16.320
what does Quantum Computing do that other things
can't and part of that is we have to actually
0:13:16.320,0:13:23.340
figure it out because the field of of quantum
Computing and Quantum algorithms is still being
0:13:23.340,0:13:29.940
explored and it's difficult to explore until you
have the machine to do it right similar to like
0:13:30.780,0:13:36.600
uh some of the some of the original mathematicians
who predicted what computers could do had to do it
0:13:36.600,0:13:41.820
all with pencil and paper and there's only so
much that you can do to predict what you know
0:13:41.820,0:13:45.780
what uses of a machine you can have like you
know when when we got to punch cards and stuff
0:13:46.680,0:13:53.460
um and and then compilers uh it's it's not in it's
not immediately obvious what you can do with a
0:13:53.460,0:13:58.260
computational engine when it is still hypothetical
or theoretical like Quantum Computing is
0:13:59.340,0:14:06.660
um so right off the top you know Material
Science um AI modeling like one of the things
0:14:06.660,0:14:10.980
that I thought was really cool that that some
people predict Quantum Computing could do is
0:14:10.980,0:14:16.320
where you give it a whole bunch of data and it
just magically like magically pops out the AI
0:14:16.320,0:14:22.920
model you know it it fits all the parameters for
your your neural network like with basically no
0:14:22.920,0:14:28.980
training time um because it it superposition
and everything settles into the lowest energy
0:14:28.980,0:14:34.020
states on and so forth um you could do the
same thing with materials right and we'll
0:14:34.020,0:14:40.440
get we'll be we'll get back to the the power of
AI and materials in a minute but um in general
0:14:40.440,0:14:47.940
I think that I think that modeling really complex
systems like economics Material Science that sort
0:14:47.940,0:14:54.720
of thing and cryptography are probably going to
be the first things but I also suspect that that
0:14:54.720,0:15:01.200
because Quantum Computing is kind of specialized
in the same way that like gpus are specialized if
0:15:01.200,0:15:05.160
we can ever get Quantum Computing down onto
a single chip operating at room temperature
0:15:06.240,0:15:12.840
it will probably be a companionship like you have
a GPU and a TPU sitting alongside your CPU right
0:15:12.840,0:15:18.420
and then you'll have a qpu a Quantum processing
unit so I suspect and this is this is way more
0:15:18.420,0:15:23.760
than like five or ten years right this is this
is like 10 to 20 to maybe 50 years into the
0:15:23.760,0:15:30.180
future once Quantum Computing is miniaturized and
then it serves as a co-processor that accelerates
0:15:30.180,0:15:35.760
you know other kinds of processing anyways keep
an eye on this space I think that I think that
0:15:35.760,0:15:40.020
you're going to see it see the space heating up a
little bit I don't think we're going to have any
0:15:40.020,0:15:48.180
solitary breakthroughs just yet um yeah uh but
I could be wrong you know um but I think it'll
0:15:48.180,0:15:53.880
I think you'll see some acceleration in 2023 on
Quantum Computing now the surprise entrance so
0:15:53.880,0:15:59.400
that there with with acceleration and exponential
growth it's impossible to really predict so it
0:15:59.400,0:16:06.540
could be wrong one thing that I have seen a lot
more news on over the last six weeks is photonic
0:16:06.540,0:16:13.560
Computing this is light-based um information
transfer and Computing and the fact that I see
0:16:13.560,0:16:20.460
this space accelerating suddenly we might be close
to assaultatory breakthrough in photonic Computing
0:16:20.460,0:16:30.600
which this would basically gut Moore's Law and
the reason is because um it has to do with like
0:16:30.600,0:16:35.640
the thermodynamics of it but basically the short
version is photonic Computing has the potential
0:16:35.640,0:16:43.020
to be a hundred or a thousand times more energy
efficient than um electron based Computing um
