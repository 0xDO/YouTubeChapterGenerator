The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: but the point being is that you can see that there are roughly 12 or so a dozen or so specific big big regions of the brain each of these regions has much smaller parts um that uh that have specialized purposes there's also different components that are not represented here so point being is this is the brain it's got a lot of specialized region so here's like the brain stem that comes up and then the first thing is the primitive reptile brain then the the mammalian midbrain and then the human neocortex which is the big part on top so it's like a stack right and then off to the side you've got the cerebellum which helps control i think that's a cerebellum i might be wrong i should know this i've read a lot of neuroscience thing is is i read the parts and then i don't look at the diagram um and so anyways uh this helps coordinate complex motions so for instance if you have damage to the cerebellum or degenerative disease your emotions will be more jerky and you'll have less fine motor control um alcoholism chronic alcoholism will actually shrink the cerebellum um as well and any number of other things um okay so you get the idea that the brain has specialized structures and regions okay the human brain has 12 main components and hundreds of some sub components all with different specializations that's what i was just saying excuse me i don't know why i'm stuffy okay so what brain disease and injury tells us the first thing is that the brain is not monolithic your brain can break in specific ways and you lose very specific functions rather than global loss so for instance if you get a lesion on one part of your brain it's not like you're five percent less overall you will have loss of function wherever that brain legion is um or if you get like a head injury from a car accident or whatever so there's a few examples acute amnesia where that has to do with injuries to the hippocampus i believe so that's a very so the hippocampus is um this guy right here i believe um hippocampus literally means seahorse and so it's it's the seahorse-shaped part of the brain so acute amnesia means you lose your episodic recall you lose the story of your life but you don't lose declarative recall you still remember facts you still remember how to speak right so you can lose a very specific part of your memory but not even all of your memory loss of speech and stroke so one thing that that often happens when people have a stroke is that you know you might end up paralyzed on one side of your body you might end up without speech or any number of things but that's because a stroke happens and it damages one part of your brain loss of motor function and degenerative disease and then uh one of the more interesting things is visual neglect and uh prosopagnosia so visual neglect is where you don't notice things on one side of your field of vision or you don't notice specific things because you can no longer identify them and then prosopagnosia is face blindness where you see a face and it does not connect to identity recognition you say okay i see a face i don't know who that is right and it doesn't matter if you've seen them every day of your life you don't recognize the face because the visual image visual information of that face does not connect to the the episodic recall or the id you know whatever parts of your brain identify that is a person that i know so there's communication between specialized regions um and damage to those specialized reason regions resembles a microservices architecture so for instance um you know like if you're on netflix or amazon light you know you might get a notice a pop-up that says like oh hey your queue isn't available right now but all this other stuff is still working right that's what i mean by like you can lose one part but the rest of it's still working um so all of this interconnectedness in the brain but also the brain regions can function quasi-independently so for instance if you have prosopagnosia face blindness you can still see but you can't recognize faces or specific there's other kinds of things where like you can't recognize an object i can't remember what it's called but there was um i was reading about a specific thing where it's like um people have lost the ability to recognize specific objects and like they can describe it but they're like uh i don't know what that is i don't know what it's for but then they take their eyes off of it and they can still use it because the functional part of their brain that says i know how to use this tool because i don't need to look at nail clippers to use them i can feel it and so they feel it and they're like oh i know what that is i know how to use it and even if they don't consciously know how to use it it's weird you read you read vs ramachandran he's got all kinds of stories like that so when you when you see how granular and modular the human brain is you realize huh that sounds a lot like a microservices architecture at least that's what i did i'm a systems engineer um professionally so i want to tease my audience is this a microservice network or a brain map i'm not going to tell you i'm just going to say do you think that this is a map of of communications between microservices or is this a a map of a brain or a brain region or what um so i'll let you guys figure it out tell me in the comments if uh if you know what this is um don't spoil it for anyone else okay so how do we copy the brain obviously uh the human brain is our best model for intelligence and so a lot of work is put into modeling the human brain as a way to get um super you know machine intelligence uh you know the biggest all the biggest things right now are deep learning neural networks right so it's no surprise to me that our smartest machines um or at least the ones that are most similar to human intelligence are neural networks so we're modeling we're copying the way that the human brain works at a microscopic level right so but what about what

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

There are twelve main regions of the brain, each with specialized purposes. The regions are the brain stem, the primitive reptile brain, the mammalian midbrain, and the human neocortex. The cerebellum helps coordinate complex motions. Alcoholism can shrink the cerebellum. Brain diseases and injuries show that the brain is not monolithic. A lesion in one part of the brain can cause loss of function in that specific area. Head injuries can cause acute amnesia, loss of speech, or paralysis. Visual neglect can cause prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The interconnectedness of the brain regions resembles a microservices architecture. The brain regions can function quasi-independently. Work is being done to copy the brain in order to create machine intelligence. Neural networks are modeled after the human brain and are the smartest machines currently in existence.
