0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:19.380,0:04:26.280
a hyperabundance of of thermal energy there's
pretty much nothing you can't do right like you
0:04:26.280,0:04:30.720
can you can even well it would take a different
kind of physics to like break the speed of light
0:04:30.720,0:04:35.760
so I'm not going to comment on that but at
least in terms of industrial things that we do
0:04:35.760,0:04:42.360
right anything mechanical or industrial suddenly
becomes the marginal cost becomes basically zero
0:04:43.320,0:04:49.860
um and what I mean by marginal cost is the the
cost of you know making a ton of concrete when
0:04:49.860,0:04:56.400
you have a hyperabundance of of energy from Fusion
the cost of making a ton of concrete is near zero
0:04:56.400,0:05:03.180
the cost of cultivating an acre of land is near
zero right and so then Fusion is probably one
0:05:03.180,0:05:09.180
of the biggest technologies that will help us to
get to a post-scarcity or hyperabundance economy
0:05:09.180,0:05:14.340
which oh boy you think people can't agree
on economics now just wait till that happens
0:05:15.000,0:05:21.060
okay so that's number one Fusion in 2023 keep
your eyes on this space it's gonna get wild
0:05:22.200,0:05:29.460
um all right now Fusion might still be 5 10 20
years from being commercial right we hit we like
0:05:29.460,0:05:36.720
within this week we had a huge breakthrough um but
in the meantime we're still going to need other
0:05:36.720,0:05:45.660
kinds of energy right because um you know between
between uh Global geopolitical uh things you know
0:05:45.660,0:05:52.140
Russia China everyone else who's not getting
along fossil fuels are going to be you know
0:05:52.140,0:05:59.580
they're they're already unpopular right because
of climate change but solar and wind in particular
0:05:59.580,0:06:05.100
are becoming so cheap so quickly and this actually
reminds me I forgot to add Battery Technology
0:06:05.820,0:06:09.480
um there's more more news coming out about
better batteries and cheaper batteries anyways
0:06:10.440,0:06:15.480
um Renewables are accelerating so people
people don't believe me when I say this I
0:06:15.480,0:06:22.380
have a friend actually who who um started their
graduate program in this space and before they
0:06:22.380,0:06:25.680
started their graduate program they were so
angry about climate change you know every time
0:06:25.680,0:06:30.840
the ipcc report came out they're like you know
the world is ending we're in trouble and I'm
0:06:30.840,0:06:34.800
like no we're not no we're not like it's it's
going to be fine like this problem is solved
0:06:35.640,0:06:40.620
um but it needs to be deployed right when I say
the problem is solved I don't mean that climate
0:06:40.620,0:06:46.380
change is is gone I mean that from a technology
standpoint from a scientific standpoint we have
0:06:46.380,0:06:52.680
the capacity to become carbon neutral or carbon
negative now it's just a matter of deployment so
0:06:52.680,0:06:57.900
that's why you see things like tax incentives
um and carbon credits because the idea is
0:06:58.800,0:07:05.100
um under neoliberal theory is you incentivize the
behavior you want to see so and you use Financial
0:07:05.100,0:07:10.500
incentives so you create incentives to do the
for the market to do the things that you want
0:07:10.500,0:07:16.500
so it's like okay for every you know ton of
carbon you Offset you get credits for every
0:07:16.500,0:07:22.740
kilowatt of solar you deploy you get credits
whatever so anyways that is working and we are
0:07:22.740,0:07:27.960
seeing this accelerate because you know you might
remember in the last you know in 2015 they said oh
0:07:27.960,0:07:33.180
it's going to be 2045 before we can even offset
coal because coal is so cheap and so easy and so
0:07:33.180,0:07:40.320
efficient but the thing is is um the the market
has responded right and so all the biggest all
0:07:40.320,0:07:45.480
the biggest uh tech companies GE Honeywell um I
can't remember but those are two of the biggest
0:07:45.480,0:07:51.000
ones that just like they churn out like you know
they know how to mass produce stuff and so it's
0:07:51.000,0:07:56.160
like hey we need to mass produce this let's do
it let's get on it and so that drives down the
0:07:56.160,0:08:01.980
cost of solar panels and um and uh and and wind
farms but then also there's other things like
0:08:02.820,0:08:08.160
um it takes a while for banks to catch on right
like because you see like a solar farm like this
0:08:08.160,0:08:14.760
this takes investment right and and like most
energy generation there's an upfront investment
0:08:15.720,0:08:22.140
um but what is different about solar is that
it's entirely up front with very low operating
