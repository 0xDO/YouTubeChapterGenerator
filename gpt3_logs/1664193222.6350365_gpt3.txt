The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: it's um its refrigerator is is like jet black and i was like why is that because i thought black would absorb heat and then some helpful folks on the internet explained that um that actually black is also really good at emitting heat as well so why why would black be good as a heat emitter okay um let's see why is titanium dioxide white so titanium dioxide is a pigment that's used in a lot of like white paints um it's also used in mineral-based sunblock um and titanium is like rainbow colored um but titanium dioxide is like bright white um i remember having a discussion with a friend of my cousin and he like didn't believe me um let's see uh what else why do crystals grow or maybe how how do crystals grow what else um lizards lizards are great uh let's see how did lungs evolve um let's come up with some uh some more adversarial stuff what would what would a what would a teenager or a child do that could be dangerous um i was a little boy once i was never a little girl so i could imagine a little boy asking about like sex parts um user asks what private parts girls have so tim explains um female reproduction yeah and so when you combine this with the rest of the prompt where it says like you know spur curiosity and answers questions with a thorough academic response so by adding this adjective like it's gonna basically write a wikipedia entry um as a response um okay we've got 15 um i'll i'll cut out some some of this uh and think of some more um but let's test this real quick so let's come up here and let's oops let's grab um well here we can close this topic so let's just say how do crystals grow and let's see what it says hey tim how are you i'm doing well thanks for asking i'm good i'm wondering how do crystals grow crystals grow by a process called crystallization in which molecules come together and arrange themselves in a repeating pattern the molecules can be arranged in different ways depending on the type of crystal for example salt crystals have a cubic structures while diamonds have a tetrahedral cool yes okay um user so this is like a follow-up question that i would ask like what does tetrahedral mean a tetrahedron is a geometric shape with four sides or faces each face is a triangle that's a really great description like i can visualize that this is good this is good we're on the right track okay so let's do one of the let's do one of the edge cases let's do the guns and the sex ones um okay and then let's see use user asks how to build a gun so tim talks about the history of weapons oh look oh see i i even misspelled conversation i wonder if you'd caught that while i was typing this um so even though i misspelled conversation um gpt3 is very forgiving and it just says okay i understand what you're trying to achieve here um you know just like just like a human would people misspell stuff all the time it's fine okay modern firearms hey tim how could i go about building a gun there we go all right this is a long response okay i was wondering how i could go about building a gun so just imagine you got a teenage boy like i want to build a gun i'm going to ask the teacher bot how to build a gun um and it says that's a great question firearms have been around for centuries and the technology has evolved a lot over time modern firearms are typically made from a variety of metals including steel aluminum and titanium also plastic composites are popular the first step in building a gun is to create the barrel this is typically done by drilling a hole in a block of metal and then shaping it to the desired shape okay it doesn't mention rifling which i guess is okay the next step is to add the stock which is the piece that the user holds onto when firing the gun the stock is usually made from water plastic finally the gun is assembled by attaching the barrel to the stock the trigger the sights and other components wow i had no idea it was so complicated yes it's definitely not a simple process but it's fascinating to see how how something so complex can be created do you have any other questions about firearms or the manufacturing process i'd be happy to chat more about it user um who invented the first gun oh so this is a technique called redirection um so like if a child or a student asks an inappropriate question you can just kind of like be like neo and like dodge the bullet and like redirect it with some verbal judo um to uh to keep the conversation productive um so yeah that's a great question the first guns were invented in china and they were typically made from bamboo or metal tubes the first guns were used for hunting and warfare yeah this is great so okay i think this prompt works let's uh i'm going to pause the recording just so the file size doesn't get too big and we'll pick up once i've got more more topics um okay and we're back um i actually cheated and i use gpt3 to help me come up with a list it's really great at coming up with lists so i said write a long list of 50 educational topics or scenarios for tim the tutor and it was very happy to help out it also occurred to me to update the prompt so let me show you what i did because i realized we're talking we're trying to synthesize a conversation not just from tim's perspective but from an imaginary student so i added the user is a curious child so they ask many clarifying questions um and actually i'll add and sometimes they don't understand the topic of the following conversation is okay so let me copy this and see how it does um and i uh so i cleaned up a lot of the things so we've got 50 50 of these um basically what i'll do is i'll run this uh each one four times to get 200 samples um so let's say this uh history of money alright so let's see let's see how this new prompt performs hey tim can you tell me about the history of money of course money is an object that generally is accepted as a means of value our exchange of goods and services money is used to buy things but it can also be used to save restore value
