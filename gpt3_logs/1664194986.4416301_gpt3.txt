CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I am rapidly shifting away from using the term artificial general intelligence (AGI). I don't think it's particularly helpful or useful.

The first reason is that intelligence is such a vague, squishy concept. It's not a behavior; it's an attribute or a characteristic. And it's a poorly defined one at that. So what is AGI? It's such a vague concept, and the goal posts keep getting moved on it.

In the meantime, I have been researching and building what I'm coming to call artificial cognition. I mean, I wrote a book called Natural Language Cognitive Architecture. That's what it does: it performs cognition.

Cognition is something that is much more objective and measurable. But it's also a behavior, and it's something that is easy to characterize and observe. So it's a lot easier to work on and talk about.

AGI is so vague and squishy. It means everything to everyone. Whereas artificial cognition is a lot more specific. I think it's ultimately going to be a lot more helpful.

Anyways, that's just a quick update about my work and where I'm heading.
