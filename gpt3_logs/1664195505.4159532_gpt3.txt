The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: might have to answer for version 4 is where do those services run um in some cases you know depending on how optimized things are it could run on you know like if you've got a decent um home computer they might also you might need to have some of these services run in the cloud we might need to figure out blockchains and other things for security and privacy so security privacy and safety are huge um and so we'll need to we'll need to think about that right so for instance if you've got a smart home device that's always watching and listening you want that data secured at all costs you would rather lose that data than have it stolen so that is going to be absolutely critical to figure out before getting too far along in the project is we we've got to figure out safety security and privacy um results where to go resiliency so again we're going to continue trying to break the heuristic imperatives we want to ensure that that this machine will never be evil and that even if it has the chance to reprogram itself that it will choose not to or that it will choose not to do experiments to break its own heuristic imperatives i've already done some experiments where where if you do it right it thinks through and says i'm not going to make that change because i might create a version of myself that does not adhere to my goals and so we'll do we'll also continue doing longitudinal tests long running simulations again by by creating simulation environments we can test these things to fail failure to see if or when the heuristic comparatives fail and under what conditions so that we can adapt the rest of the architecture or the heroes to comparative service so that it doesn't fail ideally um moragi version five so this is the final release this is going to be deployment for mass consumption so basically you know release it models that are going to be for like smartphones smart home etc so consumer consumer deployment this is i'm not i'm not planning on doing this for profit mostly what i want to do is is get an open source version out there under the mit license so that for-profit companies can deploy it if they want um so there's gonna be the consumer level um there's gonna be an aim for business level such as having executive assistants that can you know that you know a manager can talk to like hey how do i do this um and that and that maybe you can have a version of meragi that connects into like your company database so that you can have this smart agent that can you know either help you out as as an assistant or could even possibly do some work and then there's also the government level so for instance one possible way that that maragi that this system could help is that it could be an interface between citizens and the government so that like you can ask questions like how does the law work or what how do i do my taxes or you know to basically be a go between an intelligent agent that can be um that can they can be basically a civil servant is kind of the goal there of course there's any number of implementations that i can't even think of once you have a general purpose intelligent autonomous agent but really the goal for version five is to get moragi systems everywhere in the world to provide intelligent agencies um stability and positive influence because remember the goal here is to create autonomous machines that are going to behave benevolently for all time so that is the road map so going back version one is test proof of concept prove out the things get some best practices and start as a distributed team version two get the fine tuning and the conductor worked working um version three hardware integration version four scale security stability and i probably should have added safety but that's kind of implied and then finally version five is mass deployment and integration so recap we're just getting started there's a long road ahead but there is no there are no barriers anymore all of the necessary technologies are out now it's just a matter of doing the research doing the implementation and testing it the bit the last barrier was the large language models and those prices are coming down fast and there's lots of open source ones coming out like the um amazon just released their alexa tm there's bloom um there's all kinds of other models that are coming out and they're coming out faster and faster as this research is accelerating so there is no longer any barrier to for success here it's just a matter of doing the work so thank you for watching um please consider joining the team um reach out to me um there's also the discord link in my youtube video in the description um and also consider supporting us on patreon um every little bit helps because uh eventually maybe one day i'll be able to do this full time but right now i still have my day job so with that being said thanks for watching um and let me know if you have any questions jump in the comments or jump in a discord server talk to everyone later

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It is now possible to create autonomous machines that behave benevolently for all time. The goal of the Maragi project is to create such machines and deploy them around the world.

The project is currently in its early stages. The first step is to create a proof of concept and establish best practices. This is being done by a distributed team.

The next step is to fine-tune the conductor (the component that controls the machine) and hardware integration. This will allow the machine to be more reliable and efficient.

After that, the focus will be on security, stability, and safety. This is important because the data collected by the machine needs to be secure, and the machine itself needs to be safe.

Finally, the goal is to mass-deploy the machine. This will involve integrating it into various systems, such as smart homes and businesses.

The last barrier to this project was the large language models, but prices are coming down and there are now many open source options available.
