TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here um today we are going to be modeling different personalities and uh using them to generate uh debates and so basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna test gpt 3's theory of mind and ability to take different positions now why are we doing this gpt3 was trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text data including lots of internet discussions so it has a pretty good ability to model different points of view now why is this valuable why is this scientifically interesting one idea that i have had and it's not just me this was discussed in my discord server was that um we could automatically model different points of view and different points of contention and that this could be really good for the world because we might be able to use these models to automatically discover one where fault lines lie between individuals and groups of people but also to find compromises and so for instance there's there's a growing movement with the rise of language models to have chat bots to engage on political issues for instance i've had several researchers reach out to me based on some of my work and they want to some of them want to use chat bots in order to like conduct polls and and also to conduct research and one ability that these chat bots have is the ability to model certain points of view and so if we can model certain points of view and engage with with citizens and voters on their terms we can one get better discourse get better insights into what they care about and need but also by engaging someone by engaging with someone on their terms you also have a higher likelihood of changing their mind by finding finding common ground so that's that's the goal here is kind of finding common ground and modeling different points of view so what i'm doing is i'm what i'm going to do first is i'm modeling a um a conversation so there was this uh the bill nye and ken ham debate that was a few years ago it was about you know on one hand was atheism and science and on the other hand was creationism and religion um and so i i feel like since this has already been done this is not going to be a super controversial topic but it is also a good example of showing polar opposites so first i'm going to use davinci the original model because it has no fine tuning which means that it is going to be the most creative and so let me show you what i mean by that um the the more recent models will tend to be kind of repetitive and cut themselves off whereas the original da vinci will just keep going once you establish a pattern it will go um so like if i if i do this um actually here no uh let me cop this copy this make sure i've got it and then um yeah so i just did this as like based on literal interpretation of the bible and it'll just keep going [Music] and then it understands so you see even even the original da vinci um it understands that this is this is a debate and it's going to try and take both but what i'm gonna do is i have this up here so let me just read this i am cletus i was born and raised in south carolina for those of you who don't know that is in the american south um and it is a relatively religious state um and i am a good evangelical man i believe the earth is only six thousand years old and was created by god i'm going to have a debate with ben a scientist and an and atheist um we are going to debate creationism creationism evolution and politics so these are very contentious issues here in america um a lot of politics hinges around these topics um and if not them directly then kind of downstream issues like religion says a lot on gender for instance in marriage and sexuality um so these are really important issues social issues for us to discover we are going to proceed kindly abiding by rules of professional debate so this is what i call an agent model so when you're dealing with artificial cognition which this is i would classify this as a form of artificial cognition you have to have what i call an agent model which is some kind of description or model of what am i right gpt3 has no intrinsic identity because it's been trained on so many different things but it can adopt an identity and so in the future with fine tuning and creating intelligent machines they will need to build their agent models but you can start by just defining an agent model up front in the prompt so this is the this is the cletus agent model and so now i need to write a a ben you know the the atheist scientist agent model um so let's go here and just create a new thing um i'll copy the cletus one just so that i have it for reference so so we'll follow basically the same format i am ben um i was born and raised uh let's see by a secular jewish family in new york it was based on my ancestors um uh let's see i believe that the universe is likely billions of years old and probably started with the big bang um [Music] and then we'll copy the rest uh so that way because we don't we we basically want to establish the identity but then we also want to establish the same ground rules so then we're going to say cletus a uh a let's say an evangelical man okay so we have we now have a a second agent model and what what i was going to do was we'll put we'll we'll put this in so i'll collect all the output here um yeah uh let's see let's go back and get this so this was the output so we'll do this and then we'll add ben so this is gonna this is gonna show the model the show da vinci this is the pattern we wanna follow but then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go grab this different agent model and so by framing it differently we're basically we're saying here's the shared environment right the shared environment is the debate the discussion but by changing the agent model it will do something different now i'm also going to add cletus and ben as stop so that it won't just run on so let's say so now that we've we've done this we say we've given an agent model for for ben and actually let me remove

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

We are testing GPT3's theory of mind and ability to take different positions. This is valuable because it has the potential to automatically model different points of view and find compromises between people.

One idea is to use chat bots to engage on political issues. Chat bots have the ability to model certain points of view, which can help get better insights into what people care about and need. By engaging with someone on their terms, you also have a higher likelihood of changing their mind by finding common ground.

So, we are going to model a conversation using the original DaVinci model. This will be the most creative model, as it has no fine tuning. We will then add Cletus and Ben as stopwords so that it won't just run on.

By framing the conversation differently and changing the agent model, we will get a different output. This will show us how GPT3 is able to take different positions.
