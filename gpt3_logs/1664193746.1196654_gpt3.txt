The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with another video uh sorry it's been a little while this video is about the question generator that i created for uh my natural language cognitive architecture and first i have to say like okay why do you need a question generator there's a lot of reasons that you might want to be able to generate questions the reason that i created it is because natural language cognitive architecture relies on generating questions in order to retrieve the correct memories but also asking questions is a really great way to decide what to do i personally believe that unconscious questions are a big way that humans make decisions and i have a lot more details about this in my book i don't need to go into details about specifically cognitive architecture here there's a lot of other things that you could you could use when uh generating questions for so first i wanted to show you around the repository there should be a link below uh in the video description so first what i did was i put together a whole bunch of contexts there are like 55 000 contexts in this folder you can you can download them all they came from open source data sets so don't don't hesitate to use these if you look through it you'll probably recognize some of them and then what i did was i used a few different prompts in order to generate questions and those questions are just like this just a set of questions uh in response to any given passage and i used a bunch of different kinds of of uh of context so there's movie dialogue right so you see this this is pretty familiar um this is a this is a really common data set uh i also used let's see i used medical text these are de-identified medical texts um oh here let me make it so you can see it all there we go um so medical texts which of course there's no narrative it's just information um and i knew that i was onto something when an earlier test um gpt3 deduced that a patient probably had cancer and it asks did this pa does this patient have cancer and i looked up that particular medical text then yeah sure enough some of the test results indicated the risk of cancer i also used news articles and then i used reddit posts which of course reddit is information seeking and then finally i used uh stack exchange posts and again these all came from open source data sets you can search for all of these on kaggle or google data sets it's all open source so i didn't i didn't steal this from anyone i know that some people are worried about data privacy and data governance but these are all publicly available data sets so i start with those contexts and then i use several prompts you can you can look in the um in the repository yourself and and check it out and i use it to generate questions and these questions um you could use it for anything right you could use it to automatically generate uh test questions for reading comprehension right you could use you could use these questions for other um artificial intelligence things you could use it for chat bots actually even just having a chat bot that asks good questions is a really powerful thing to have right so with all that said uh you know just lots of questions so that was the training set and finally what it looked like the finished product it looks like this so um gpt3 is trained with json l files um and you see here so there's a prompt these first ones are some dialogue and all that you have to do is whatever whatever payload you want you um you add in all caps questions colon that's how that's how the model knows that it's done and then you um you go from there so let me show you what actually happens in real time i think that'll help it make the most sense so let's go grab a random context from reddit just because they tend to be narrative and that one's a little bit long let me grab a shorter one okay this one says so this context says i'm 23 and have a bs in biology and a contract job ending soon what should be my next move i graduated last year in biology etc etc okay so this is someone just asking for some career advice now generating questions obviously this person is looking for answers right but asking questions seeking more information is a perfectly valid response right because someone might ask questions because they don't know um they they need more information to know how to help right so we'll put it into gpd3 and i'll do this to finish it off questions actually you can just do one space and then let's see what it says um it takes a second to load it actually might have unloaded um one thing that i found with with uh gpt3 is that it takes it a minute to load your um your custom models um i'm not i'm not happy about that i really wish that um it was as fast as um as as the plain vanilla models um but anyways we'll see if it loads it might it might crash and i'll have to come back to it i'll try it again in a second um yeah so let's see well while that's loading i'll show you around the uh the repo a little bit more um let's see oh yeah that's what i can show you uh so here's an example of one prompt i used a davinci instruct to create the synthetic data set i said write a list of moral and ethical questions an observer would ask about the following passages and then i did this to generate questions um the questions field oh there we go okay it ran so here we go so i i put in this and because of the fine-tuned data set that i had these are the questions that spit out what is the next move so for someone with a bs in biology and a contract job ending soon that's a perfectly valid question um you know it might be grad school it might be another job what are the next steps in becoming a researcher or entrepreneur what is the most important question to ask oneself when considering going back to school for a masters what is covid and what does it do gpt3 doesn't know what covid is because gpt3 was trained before covet existed so these questions could be used for either responding to the person or they

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Hey everyone, David Shapiro here with another video. Sorry it's been a little while. This video is about the question generator that I created for my natural language cognitive architecture.

First, I have to say that there are a lot of reasons you might want to be able to generate questions. The reason I created this question generator is because my natural language cognitive architecture relies on generating questions in order to retrieve the correct memories. But also, asking questions is a really great way to decide what to do. I personally believe that unconscious questions are a big way that humans make decisions.

I put together a whole bunch of contexts for the question generator, around 55,000 of them. They came from open source data sets, so don't hesitate to use them. I used a few different prompts in order to generate questions, and those questions are just like this: a set of questions in response to any given passage. I used a bunch of different kinds of context, including movie dialogue, medical text, news articles, Reddit posts, and Stack Exchange posts.

With all that said, there are just lots of questions. So that was the training set. And finally, what it looked like when I finished was this: a JSONL file with a prompt and the questions generated in response to that prompt.

You can use the question generator for anything. You could use it to automatically generate test questions for reading comprehension, or you could use it for chatbots. Actually, even just having a chatbot that asks good questions is a really powerful thing to have.

To show you how it works, I'll grab a random context from Reddit and put it into the question generator. This one says, "I'm 23 and have a BS in biology and a contract job ending soon. What should be my next move?"

Asking questions is a perfectly valid response to this, because someone might need more information to know how to help. So we'll put it into the question generator and see what it says.

One thing to note is that it takes a minute for the question generator to load your custom models. I'm not happy about that, I really wish that it was as fast as the plain vanilla models.

Anyway, we'll see if it loads. It might crash and I'll have to come back to it. I'll try it again in a second.

Okay, so the question generator spit out these questions: "What is the next move for someone with a BS in biology and a contract job ending soon?", "What are the next steps in becoming a researcher or entrepreneur?", "What is the most important question to ask oneself when considering going back to school for a masters?", and "What is covid and what does it do?"

GPT3 doesn't know what covid is because GPT3 was trained before covid existed. So these questions could be used for either responding to the person or they could be used to generate more questions. Either way, the question generator is a powerful tool.
