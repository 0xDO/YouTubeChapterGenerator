0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:15:43.260,0:15:49.860
perfect perfect Okay so we've got a good
cover letter now at the top of your resume
0:15:51.240,0:15:55.260
um well here I'll run this again real quick um
so at the top of your resume you should always
0:15:55.260,0:16:01.140
have a professional objective section um because
not everyone reads a cover letter um academic
0:16:01.140,0:16:09.000
institutions medical institutions they are more
likely to read your cover letter but if you're
0:16:09.000,0:16:17.220
applying for a tech company often the cover letter
is completely discarded so for instance as on the
0:16:17.220,0:16:24.420
on the hiring side um I uh like HR often just will
not pass on a cover letter you just get the resume
0:16:24.420,0:16:30.360
so what you want to do is have a professional
objective section at the top of your resume which
0:16:30.360,0:16:37.440
is a copy of this but it's extremely cut down
so what we'll do is we'll just add we'll take
0:16:37.440,0:16:44.220
the same text block and we'll say Okay so let's
copy this and say write a highly professional
0:16:44.820,0:16:57.720
um let's see uh let's see write a uh professional
objectives um section for the top of a resume
0:16:59.040,0:17:11.760
um it should be uh just um three
sentences or so um it should convey uh
0:17:12.360,0:17:19.380
a lot uh that should see it should uh this
one we might need to give it an example um
0:17:22.500,0:17:28.020
and summarize the um applicant very well
0:17:29.940,0:17:38.040
um okay so then we'll say professional objectives
paragraph all right so let's just see if this
0:17:38.040,0:17:44.940
works prompt professional objectives because
I got my my current job by having a dynamite
0:17:44.940,0:17:49.320
professional objective section I actually had
help from a friend who is a professional like
0:17:49.320,0:17:53.640
talent scout and I'm pretty sure my
current boss he read my professional
0:17:53.640,0:17:59.640
objective and like read no further because
I said things like you know I like adhering
0:17:59.640,0:18:05.100
to best practices and raising the bar and you
know it's just like okay you you want to convey
0:18:05.100,0:18:14.700
a lot about your personality in a professional
objective section um convey the um the top uh
0:18:17.580,0:18:26.880
qualities and personality um in the paragraph Okay
so let's see if this works so we'll go ahead and
0:18:26.880,0:18:35.700
we will add so we've already got the text block so
then we'll do um another section so then we'll do
0:18:35.700,0:18:42.360
um get professional objective and so
we'll say uh well here we can just copy
0:18:44.880,0:18:52.440
copy that so instead of prompt cover letter we'll
do professional objective and we'll just use the
0:18:52.440,0:18:57.360
same information we'll get a same completion
and instead of save file cover letter will do
0:18:58.080,0:19:07.440
professional objective okay so let's see how
this works we might like I said this because
0:19:07.440,0:19:17.460
it needs to be more concise I'm not I'm not as as
optimistic that it will work well um especially
0:19:17.460,0:19:21.540
because a professional objective section is a lot
less commonly talked about than a cover letter
0:19:23.160,0:19:27.780
um professional objective Dynamic spell it
0:19:30.300,0:19:35.580
professional objective odd
okay yes I did misspell it
