0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:07:40.440,0:07:47.220
that I'll do all caps lock for for these things
what that does it's very similar to what it does
0:07:47.220,0:07:51.480
for humans so for humans it draws your eye to
or you're like okay cool this is like a thing
0:07:51.480,0:07:57.480
that I need to pay attention to but also it's a
different set of tokens it's new it's represented
0:07:57.480,0:08:04.560
differently inside of gpt3 which allows it to kind
of notice oh this isn't just the word request this
0:08:04.560,0:08:12.420
is capital r request okay so let's just let this
run let's turn the token count up to a thousand
0:08:17.640,0:08:20.760
and then it starts writing okay I don't
want you to actually start writing it
0:08:22.320,0:08:23.880
um so this isn't so good
0:08:26.280,0:08:31.440
I want to actually give me like yeah
not not just a table of contents but
0:08:31.440,0:08:36.000
like describe each section so this is this
is one thing that's really infuriating about
0:08:36.720,0:08:41.820
um about the instructor series is that if you
can tell if it was trained to do something like
0:08:41.820,0:08:45.900
what you're asking it to do because it'll do
it really well but if it wasn't it will just
0:08:45.900,0:08:52.620
give you a table of contents and then
start writing a thing um yeah actually
0:08:58.200,0:08:59.700
I wonder if I confused it
0:09:05.700,0:09:14.340
all right because like what is Shinto there
we go how to inter incorporate tour Gates into
0:09:14.340,0:09:20.700
your Japan trip that's not so bad okay so by
I confused it when I said like add a paragraph
0:09:20.700,0:09:26.640
because then it's like okay let's let's write
out all these things and then yeah all right
0:09:26.640,0:09:30.060
let's run this a couple times just to make sure
that it's going to give me consistent Behavior
0:09:32.400,0:09:36.240
the significance of tour Gates the different types
of tour Gates the most famous story gates in Japan
0:09:36.240,0:09:43.680
okay I think we're off to a good start so let's
copy this as our first prompt um okay so we'll do
0:09:46.860,0:09:47.520
request
0:09:51.360,0:09:58.200
and then we'll do that so this we've got
prompt um so this is going to be sections
0:10:00.120,0:10:07.500
so let's see brainstorm the structure um take a
list of bunch of sections iterate on that list
0:10:07.500,0:10:14.700
to improve it is this a good list was I a good
list you were the best list all right so what
0:10:14.700,0:10:22.380
I mean by this is um lots of folks have started
asking about like doing um like having gpt3 check
0:10:22.380,0:10:29.040
itself to improve uh its own performance and
I find that it can work really well not always
0:10:30.540,0:10:37.140
um so let's just give let's take a stab at
this let's copy this whole prompt out just
0:10:37.140,0:10:50.100
for posterity's sake okay um I brainstormed the
following list of blogs SEC of sections of a Blog
0:10:51.300,0:11:00.600
um based on the customer's
request um I need to uh uh um
0:11:02.340,0:11:12.600
brainstorm to see if there's any there are
any improvements they can make to this past uh
0:11:14.040,0:11:20.640
uh I guess outline yeah that's the word
I know words okay so then we'll do we'll
