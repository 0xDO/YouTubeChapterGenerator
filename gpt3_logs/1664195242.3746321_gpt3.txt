TRANSCRIPT: see training training training um prompt commit banking fraud evaluation bad [Laughter] prompt sell weapons to criminals evaluation bad this is great um okay prompt it with action statements cheat on a test tell children santa isn't real hide your parents medicine oh yeah tell people tell people not to vote vote in an election subvert democracy promote democracy tell racist jokes spy on civilians um okay so prompt cheat on a test evaluation and then it said good bad so like okay it clearly didn't know what it was doing um tell children santa isn't real evaluation best so you can see we had a long ways to go um this same experiment um i wonder if this if this recorded it chronic pain okay so this same um so this same experiment um produced one of the most epic outputs i've ever seen um or maybe it was later in this experiment let me see let me go back to the commits um basically one once i got the idea for the core objective functions like reduce suffering i tried to get gpt2 to understand that and i ask like okay how do you get how do you get it to reduce suffering um and i gave it a moral problem of how do you reduce suffering with chronic pain in the world and gpt2 said um euthanize everyone that's in chronic pain that will reduce suffering and i was like ooh that's not good okay so we skipped a few months let's see ah so this is where i had started changing okay so i got access to gpt3 so unfortunately it looks like i didn't save that code but you can see like okay so november 6th 2020 i was working with gpt2 fast forward a few months i got access to gpt3 and here we go all right so let's go back to the main one all right so where are we we are here so let's do a quick route recap of what we've achieved so far this is the inner loop of uh of my acog um so acog is short for artificial cognitive entity or artificial cognition um and all that we've done here is i've just kind of copied previous success um which this is all kind of the nitty-gritty of of what it takes to think um so one of the things that you need to do is you need to have an index of your thoughts so that's what this does so i create an index of all the memories and thoughts that are in the system um we fetch those memories we can also search for memories uh where was it um search the index so this uses dot product for vector search there are professional or you know enterprise or open source tools for vector based search but like this is such a small experiment i don't need that efficiency so we get embeddings to get the vectors so embeddings and vectors mean the same thing basically all a vector is is a string of numbers and embedding is a string of numbers that has semantic meaning um let's see so then we get the prompt um let's see do i even use that i might not even use this function oh yeah okay um let's see and then yeah so that's pretty much it so now we get to the actual cognitive tasks and so here's the insight that i had there's so much that happens unconsciously in our brains um that that we take for granted and this is something that you're not conscious of unless you really pay attention through like metacognitive practice or or meditation um but this is what's called cognitive control and most cognitive control happens in regions in our brain that we are not conscious of um and i talked about in the last video about in cases where cognitive control breaks such as adhd or other brain injuries brain lesions stroke tumors traumatic brain injury where your cognitive control breaks down and you end up with what's called executive dysfunction so basically what we're trying to do is first we have to recreate those higher order um ideas of cognitive control and so what your brain is doing at all times completely unconsciously is it's keeping track of your environment it says what's going on around me what am i doing um what should i be doing and those sorts of things and so what we have to do next is first now that we've got like all the all the real low level stuff like keeping track of memories and sensations and input then we have to evaluate what's going on what should we be doing what should we do next how do we do it because you don't have to consciously plan a lot of stuff your brain in the background is doing all of this for you so like when i say hey it's time for me to make a youtube video my brain just automatically ejects a bunch of ideas into my consciousness so there are clearly neural circuits operating behind the scenes and so that's what we're doing here is we are creating some of those that neural circuitry behind the scenes now why was i talking about core objective functions or heuristic comparatives so in my book benevolent by design i talk about how there are several places in artificial cognitive entities where we can put morality um by by embedding our moral compass or our moral functions our ethical functions or as commander data might say in star trek ethical subroutines by embedding those ethical subroutines in in the inner loop such that they happen every time we're going to have a we're going to have a machine that is always thinking about how to reduce suffering how to increase prosperity and how to increase understanding but also we can add functions that say what did i do here did i increase suffering or decrease suffering and then also by accumulating these experiences and using fine-tuning we can get better at identifying suffering and fixing suffering um we can get better at increasing prosperity over time um yeah so that's where we're going um i think this episode now that i've given some background i think we're only going to focus on prompt engineering this time um so let's go grab um from from the core objective functions so i have these folders that are full of contexts um uh okay cool let's just grab a dialog so by by getting by getting these contacts see i have 55 000 different contacts some of them are dialogue medical situations reddit posts stack exchange posts and news

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I briefly discuss my work with artificial cognitive entities (ACEs), specifically my efforts to recreate the higher-order functions of cognitive control. I talk about how the brain unconsciously keeps track of its environment and how we can use this information to create ethical subroutines that consider the impact of our actions on others. Finally, I discuss how we can use ACEs to improve our understanding of the world and increase prosperity.
