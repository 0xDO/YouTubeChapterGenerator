TRANSCRIPT: information and loops nested within loops that allow the machine to kind of evaluate what am i thinking what do i believe why do i believe that what am i doing and why but uh we'll i'll get back to that in a month or two when i start my research cycle again um so anyways thanks for watching i just wanted to uh to jump in the conversation

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I wanted to jump in the conversation and share some thoughts on machine learning. Machine learning is a process by which machines can learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions. This is a powerful tool that can be used to help machines understand human behavior and make decisions. However, there is a lot of research that still needs to be done in this area. I am planning to start my research cycle again in a month or two and I hope to learn more about this topic. Thanks for watching!
