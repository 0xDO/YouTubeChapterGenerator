0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:01:57.420,0:02:02.760
on small scale things um it is not going to
be possible with the current token limits
0:02:03.480,0:02:08.760
um like we can do we can do again for short
stories and flash fiction um and even trying
0:02:08.760,0:02:16.500
to do it in sections is not going to be possible
so even if I had a few years to work on like fine
0:02:16.500,0:02:22.740
tuning and summarization and stuff um it's just
it's not going to happen so I'm not worried about
0:02:22.740,0:02:27.720
disrupting an industry the technology isn't there
yet but there are a few things that we can do
0:02:28.260,0:02:35.160
so as part of the auto Muse project I'll start
with the synopsis generator and the synopsis
0:02:35.160,0:02:40.560
generator does exactly what it says on the tin
it generates synopsis and so I've generated
0:02:41.340,0:02:47.820
um 200 some odd synopses and let me uh well here
they don't look good on on GitHub so let me show
0:02:47.820,0:02:51.780
you what they look like here so I've generated a
whole bunch I've deleted the ones that were too
0:02:51.780,0:02:56.700
big and too small and I kind of wish that I hadn't
because you can you can keep those bad data points
0:02:56.700,0:03:03.000
and measure them but um yeah so here's an example
like in the First Century A.D the Roman Empire
0:03:03.000,0:03:07.980
is at its height of power but in The far-flung
Outpost of Britannia things are far from stable
0:03:07.980,0:03:15.120
so this is like hey this is cool young Centurion
named Marcus flavius Aquila arrives in Britannia
0:03:15.120,0:03:20.520
with a mission so this is like a really great
story starting off Marcus search for the eagle
0:03:20.520,0:03:24.900
takes them all over Britannia this is a story
that I would read this would be like a great movie
0:03:26.160,0:03:28.560
um oh my coffee's over here
why did I put it over there
0:03:31.440,0:03:38.700
um yeah so we have like a full story end to end
so how did I do this let me explain it to you
0:03:39.240,0:03:47.460
oh and also sorry um let me zoom in a little bit
okay so we will go over the synopsis generator so
0:03:47.460,0:03:54.720
we will do uh generate synopsis so here's the
code it's pretty straightforward so I do seed
0:03:54.720,0:04:01.380
just to get a little bit of entropy and then for
I and list of range 0 to 200 you can just comment
