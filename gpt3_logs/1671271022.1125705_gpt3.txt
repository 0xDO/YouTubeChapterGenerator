0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:21:04.320,0:21:12.600
decelerating in a lot of these spaces particularly
AI fusion and um and and Computing I think we're
0:21:12.600,0:21:18.000
still on the ramp up so I think that in these
spaces we're going to continue accelerating
0:21:18.960,0:21:24.360
um and that and that will have bleed over
effects to um things like medicine genetics
0:21:24.360,0:21:31.500
and Material Science which again it's it's darn
near impossible to predict the knock-on effects
0:21:32.160,0:21:35.640
um from all these especially once
they start working together right
0:21:36.780,0:21:44.700
um so that's that's it on on on on that aspect so
a few other things in the AI space this is what I
0:21:44.700,0:21:51.420
mean by when you when you mix things right so an
experimental crisper technique has um you know
0:21:51.420,0:21:58.320
cured this 13 year old of cancer I am seeing more
and more articles like this where some AI driven
0:21:59.520,0:22:05.640
um biotech solution has done something that
thought was thought impossible another one
0:22:05.640,0:22:12.840
um like cured or prevented pancreatic cancer right
and so particularly so the net effect is like
0:22:12.840,0:22:17.880
okay so what does it do for me right do I care
about Quantum Computing or AI or deep learning
0:22:17.880,0:22:24.180
you know if you're if you're a ordinary Joe or
Jane you might not care because it's not going
0:22:24.180,0:22:31.500
to affect you the difference is the difference
is what if suddenly we have an mRNA vaccine that
0:22:31.500,0:22:39.060
prevents all cancer that is within the realm of
possibility or in this case you know a a therapy
0:22:39.060,0:22:47.040
I think that this one um yeah it was um uh it was
genetically edited immune cells right so what if
0:22:48.540,0:22:57.180
by the end of 2023 we are starting to see cancer
vaccines or other Rejuvenation therapies you know
0:22:57.180,0:23:04.380
um kind of stem cell therapies or immune therapies
that basically cure everything there is um so
0:23:04.380,0:23:09.300
along the same lines of this there's an mRNA
vaccine being worked on in New Zealand I think
0:23:09.300,0:23:16.200
that cures um like prevents all high cholesterol
with an mRNA vaccine who would have who would have
0:23:16.200,0:23:21.360
predicted that so that's what I mean by some of
these advancements you can't predict what's going
0:23:21.360,0:23:27.540
to be solved by it so all we can do is guess but
the pattern that I'm seeing is the combination
0:23:27.540,0:23:36.600
of crispr AI and mRNA vaccines I think that we
will basically solve maybe not by the end of 2023
0:23:36.600,0:23:42.240
but not long after we're going to solve pretty
much all disease whether it's cancer autologous
0:23:42.240,0:23:50.700
diseases like high cholesterol um or or Aging in
general we might have a lot of progress towards
0:23:51.360,0:23:56.700
basically preventing all forms of
death by the end of 2023 I think that
0:23:56.700,0:24:05.100
um and again the uh when you when you look at the
market right Market forces say hey there is so
0:24:05.100,0:24:10.140
much money on the table here if you are the first
one across the finish line and you can patent
0:24:11.100,0:24:16.440
um a pill or an injection that cures these
things you have the next billion dollar
0:24:16.440,0:24:23.940
pharmaceutical company right um so the race is
on uh to get these things done and this is where
0:24:23.940,0:24:27.900
AI like Alpha fold we'll get to that in just
a second actually let's go ahead and do that
0:24:28.680,0:24:32.400
um so here's another example oh this is whoops
this is the one that I was talking about
0:24:33.480,0:24:41.940
um pancreatic cancer so um you know using AI
to model these things excuse me same story
0:24:41.940,0:24:46.620
so let's just let's just move on because it's
like I'm gonna be in danger of repeating myself
0:24:48.000,0:24:56.700
Alpha fold I think uh Alpha fold is going to
be um remembered as one of the most important
0:24:56.700,0:25:02.940
Innovations and so this is where it's like okay
yes it's deep learning it's AI books but so what
0:25:02.940,0:25:10.740
right Alpha fold three when that comes out and
it's you know cheaper more efficient and can model
0:25:10.740,0:25:18.300
interactions and shapes and other stuff whatever
whatever happens um we're going to see we're gonna
0:25:18.300,0:25:24.900
this this is the technology that actually allows
for personalized genetic medicine because then you
0:25:24.900,0:25:32.520
take um you take your genome you say okay let's
let's simulate your particular proteins and we can
0:25:32.520,0:25:39.060
figure out which of your proteins are misfolding
or are not present enough and we can fix that we
