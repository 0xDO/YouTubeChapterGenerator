TRANSCRIPT: list there we go hey not bad so it gives me beltane living earth festival southeast technology instrument university 21st baron of dunsini um i could have sworn there was some dates in here there's 2020 2021 so it missed a few dates but that's okay if we turn the well i'm not going to worry about the temperature you've seen you've seen that there's different things that it can do but it did do a good job of extracting name entities and dates let's see what else can we do let's go back to my list um brainstorming rewriting classification oh here we go rewrite the following wikipedia article um uh so that it's more interesting from a uh let's see so it's more interesting for um an online um news article so then uh rewrite to be interesting and so you know you might you might your intuition might be like well a machine doesn't know what interesting is the machine doesn't need to understand what interesting really means all it has to do is match the pattern of what what it has read in hundreds of gigabytes of other text of what humans find interesting look at this this is great copy and then if it cut off because the maximum length so let's let it finish its article it's probably just about done yeah so in this case you can see it's pretty similar um but it has expanded on a lot of the stuff quite a bit um in some cases it's kind of just regurgitating what it what it um what it read up top um but it has definitely adopted um slightly new formats rewarded it just a little bit um to make it a a bit more interesting a little a little less dry and academic so rewriting is is another thing that it can do um let's see let's see rewrite the following wikipedia article so that it is let's say so it is more accessible to children so then let's come here rewrite for children so you see it's it's still got really similar information but instead of like pillars of support it just says there are four things the charity does to help bees so the language has been simplified um and and some of the some of the irrelevant details have been have been removed um let's see let's see rewrite the following wikipedia article let's just do something off the wall um in esperanto um let's see if it knows esperanto it might not rewrite in esperanto i have no idea if that's actually esperanto um it did something okay cool um let's see and uh in oh what is it there's um bbc was it bbc pigeon um i'm pretty sure they're like bbc has like a section that is now okay um oh wait hang on let's see let's say a west african um pigeon so basically what i'm remembering sorry i kind of trailed off is uh bbc started um yeah there it is okay so it does understand pidgin so this is like a kind of a simplified english um that is uh that is uh popular in some parts of africa um and so you see that like um fricatives like the has been replaced with duh dat um way day limited by guaranteed that same year e design and install yeah so it's a kind of the simplified english so by by saying rewrite um so one thing is in that's interesting is if you say translate for whatever reason gpth3 often gets confused when you say translate but if you tell it to rewrite it says okay i'm going to start from scratch and rewrite it in this other way let me do a quick time check we're at 12 minutes okay so we didn't get through too much but i showed you some really cool things that you can do with gpt3 including summarization rewriting extraction and named entity recognition we also did a little bit of parameter tweaking so we'll call that a day thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon thanks for watching
