own she still Daydreams from time to time but she knows that that they're just that it's Daydreams she's content with her life um and then it repeats the ending several times so this is where with fine-tuning data you need even more samples than what I gave it oh actually no what it did I forgot to put in the stop sequence ah yes actually no see that would have hmm interesting anyways so there is a stop sequence um so uh end right so it would have stopped here um so this oops let's see no ending the first ending so this is where it should have stopped um this is this would be a satisfying conclusion deep sense of loss and grief but she also gains a new appreciation for the simple day-to-day things in life so that is she emerges from the underworld as a changed person okay and I noticed the little uh the little speech to text thing here um so I'm gonna give that a try real quick but anyways um so yeah epic Space Opera dark and violent romantic subplot so it didn't get the Romantic subplot again this is a work in progress um and it also only gave me one named character so we'll give this a solid three or four um out of five um if it if it if this was good um it you know it got the epicness it got the dark and violent it missed the Romantic subplot and it didn't um it didn't give me too much about the setting right it gave me her backstory that's that's good but we need other characters now that being said I'm not too worried about that because part of the process of what I'm working on with auto Muse is you take a premise and you expand it and so one thing that you can do is you can just say like given the following premise here let me show you this is something that I was working on um so let's see given the following uh plot synopsis um brainstorm the cast of characters uh describe each character vividly um let's see Vivid depiction of characters and so then you just say Let It Go Delphine hey this is great um delphine's mother so even here it doesn't give them names um which is really infuriating I worked so long to try and get it to to do it to give us names I did succeed in the plotter method um and basically all you say is like you know describe to each character uh you know um I think you if you add invent names um for them I think that's all you need to do so then we'll do um Delphine dolphin's mother no it didn't work anyways so that's that's another open problem is it's good it it's good at like just taking the story and running running with it but coming up with character names for whatever reason um and place names if it's not in the initial data it's garbage it and it can't do it so that's why fine tuning is necessary anyways um here let's see if this works uh let's see start recording um okay can you use this uh hi so I'm testing the new text-to-speech beta okay hey look at that use his input cool all right so now whisper is embedded in in uh gpd3 all right this went on way longer than I meant to thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Other World is a place where everyone can stay happy. There is the moral is that if you live in a world of fantasy, the theme is really confusing, especially to people who are not familiar with story structure. The rule of thumb for theme is that it is a universal truth and so universal truth is something that is true about the human condition that is explored via story. Myths and Parables use magic or technology, you know, fantasy elements to remove human constraints to then explore that universal truth. And so the universal truth here is that, okay, imagine that you're transported to a world where everyone gets what they want but conflict still happens. So the moral here, the universal truth, the theme is that you can't just be handed what you want. Life isn't that easy.

As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the world is not a place where everyone can stay happy. Those who want something that others don't must choose sides and the lines are quickly drawn. Yes, that is human nature. I want this and it's mutually exclusive with what you want, so let's fight over it. It sounds like politics. Delphine and her friends find themselves in the middle of a war that they never wanted. So this is supposed to be a Dreamland but they end up in a war. On one side is a group of people who want to keep the world as it is, where everyone's dreams come true. On the other is ones who want to change it so that only the right kind of dreams can stay. Censorship has emerged as another moral theme. Delphine and her friends are caught in the middle and they must find a way to stop the fighting before it's too late.

The war heats up and Delphine and her friends are in the middle of the bloodshed. They find themselves facing off against the former friends and allies and it becomes clear that there's no going back. Delphine and her friends find a way to stop the fighting but at great cost. They're the only ones who escape the other world and they're left with the knowledge that their friends and loved ones are now dead. Delphine is left with a deep sense of loss and grief but she also gains a new appreciation for the simple day-to-day things in life. She has learned to stop daydreaming.

Delphine's story ends with her returning to normal life. She's changed by her experience in the other world and now she's more thoughtful and considerate person. She's also gained new respect for the people around her. Even though she didn't used to like them, she eventually finds love and starts a family of her own. She still daydreams from time to time but she knows that they're just that - daydreams. She's content with her life.

And so the moral of the story is that you can't just be handed what you want. Life isn't that easy. You have to work for what you want and even then, you might not get it.
