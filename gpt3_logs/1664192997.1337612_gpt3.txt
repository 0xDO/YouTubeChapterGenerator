TRANSCRIPT: these and let's um look at let's look at the gpt3 logs um so you see they're all yeah it pretty much got stuck on repeat so we'll just open all of these summarize the following um the dragons fly away and silas knows he has won the battle okay it seems like it almost ended the story prematurely next paragraph yeah because if we look at the story let's just let's just look at the story um so the ground shook as the dragons descended from the tower silas could see their enormous size and knew that he was in for a fight he took a step uh forward and the ground shook again um yeah he took a deep breath and stepped forward this time the ground did not shake silas could see the dragon's eyes and he knew that he was getting through to them told them that he was the chosen one and he was going to save the world the dragons let out a loud roar and flew away he knew that he had won the battle and felt felt the power surging he was knew that he was ready to face the evil that was coming okay so it got stuck on repeat after just a few iterations because the story got to a place where it was kind of done okay interesting that's fine i'm actually not worried about this because this is just a single simulation that's running it's going to have multiple things happening such as multiple characters and then a world simulation going on so that's actually okay and because all we're doing is just kind of summarizing the previous one i wonder what happened so let's do an experiment now so this is fine as it is but let's do an experiment um where it kind of it kind of um converges that's the word where it converges um and this is something that i've noticed in other experiments where it converges very quickly whoops no close that um so what happens if we come out here and what happens if we remove the summary now i'm not going to worry about that because we do need to add multiple things in but i'm going to call this a day because this this is working this is this is getting there where you can see that it can generate one link after another but what we need to do is we need to add a little bit more information not just a summary and the previous chunk what we need to do is we need to add other characters and other stuff happening in the world but you can see that given any particular chunk of story it can continue the story um but we need to we need to add enough so that it'll keep going because obviously if it just gets stuck in a loop after three or four generations that's not good enough that's fine i didn't expect it to do any better because this is just a cog in a larger machine so anyone anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

These are the gpt3 logs. You can see that the story got stuck in a loop after just a few iterations. This is because the story got to a place where it was kind of done.

Interesting that's fine i'm actually not worried about this because this is just a single simulation that's running. It's going to have multiple things happening such as multiple characters and then a world simulation going on so that's actually okay. And because all we're doing is just kind of summarizing the previous one i wonder what happened so let's do an experiment now.

So this is fine as it is but let's do an experiment where it kind of converges. This is something that I've noticed in other experiments where it converges very quickly.

What happens if we come out here and what happens if we remove the summary now? I'm not going to worry about that because we do need to add multiple things in but I'm going to call this a day because this is working. This is getting there where you can see that it can generate one link after another.

But what we need to do is we need to add a little bit more information, not just a summary of the previous chunk. What we need to do is we need to add other characters and other stuff happening in the world. But you can see that given any particular chunk of story it can continue the story.

Um but we need to we need to add enough so that it'll keep going because obviously if it just gets stuck in a loop after three or four generations that's not good enough. That's fine i didn't expect it to do any better because this is just a cog in a larger machine.

So anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon.
