The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you can predict you know the weather a week in advance animals can't do that we can also anticipate or predict how humans are going to react right because humans are complex agents and so the more you know someone or the more that you're familiar with with human thought and human behavior you can say okay if i do x to this person i'm going to get y response so that's what i mean by anticipating and predicting and then there's morality and ethics this is obviously a big thing for agi um or artificial intelligence especially if we assume that machines are going to become smarter than us one day and and we assume that we will lose control of them so i know that uh many people think oh well they're just all you know just give it an off switch we must assume that we will lose access to the off switch one day um it's just you know you build something that's smarter than you um it will out thank you it will outpace you uh that is just kind of an inevitability um and so yes that sounds scary but um i'm not i'm not worried about it because this is my this this is my jam this is what i focus on is making sure that we have a benevolent machines that aren't going to kill us or do other unwanted things okay so why take these functional domains and do it as microservices we can update the machine as we go it can be a plug and play architecture just like facebook amazon netflix are so that the the machine can keep going you can improve microservices individually but you can also make sure that those microservices are super robust that they're not going to fail and again you can add and remove microservices arbitrarily again that is that plug-and-play architecture um so maragi maragi is something that i worked on have worked on and i am now revisiting now that um i have a strong enough understanding of both neuroscience and how to model all of this so this is this is what my most recent videos have been about is creating those microservices to create a fully fledged excuse me autonomous uh artificial cognitive entity so maragi means microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence okay so that's why i'm obsessed with microservices is because i see microservices as as treating the brain like a system rather than a monolith moragi i invented it in july 2018 i went and found my original diagrams so it is four years old this month um it was originally some of the original experiments i did were with amqp which is advanced message queue protocol it is a way to have computer components talk to each other very fast um and then i also experimented with rest i've settled on rest um because it does it doesn't require a broker so amqp requires a broker but rest allows things to talk directly uh with each other um it was also originally multimodal where i would have like one service that would like take pictures and send pictures and then another that would take audio clips and send audio clips i've done away with that as since i wrote natural language cognitive architecture i realized that um that once you get into the core thought module of a brain of an artificial cognitive entity that it should you should have one modality and i chose natural language because it is interpretable and transparent um i did not have the nexus figured out i did not have the core objective functions and i did not have cognitive control figured out so there was a lot of problems when i first came up with muragi and all of them have been solved so here's some of the original diagrams so this logo is what i made i knew intuitively that there was got to be some kind of central core i had no idea what that was going to be i thought that it would be a database of some kind something that would organize it but now i realize there's a little bit more here you see a diagram that it's more distributed and there's kind of no structure where every component talks to every other component it's much more organized than that today and i'll show you the latest diagram of meragi in a second but this is these are both circa july 2018 when i first came up with the idea let's see so this is meraki today and i've shown i've shown some some diagrams of this so we've got the nexus which you you'll notice there's some similarities right so there's something in the center that everything orbits around and in this case it's the nexus and then there is some cross communication with the other things but primarily everything communicates um via the nexus so you've got a hub and spoke model of of artificial cognition today and so this is a functional model this is also a thought first model so the nexus houses the stream of consciousness for this machine and so you could basically say that um the nexus is the conscious component although that's not necessarily uh that's going to be a misnomer because people you know i can already hear people saying like you're building a conscious machine it is functionally conscious not phenomenally conscious not philosophically conscious it's just this is this is it's meant to model or emulate the human stream of consciousness and then all these other services would be the unconscious mind or whatever um let's see and then oh that's it okay so this is moragi today now you're up to speed on microservices and uh meragi and what i'm doing and why so thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon and that's that

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Microservices are a way to build software that is more modular and scalable. Moragi is a microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence (AGI). I invented it in July 2018, and it is four years old this month.

The original experiments I did with Moragi were with Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP). I later switched to Representational State Transfer (REST) because it is more lightweight and does not require a broker. Moragi was originally multimodal, meaning that it could take pictures and audio clips as input. I later realized that once you get into the core thought module of an artificial cognitive entity, it should have one modality, and I chose natural language because it is interpretable and transparent.

The latest version of Moragi is more organized, with a central nexus that everything orbits around. The nexus houses the stream of consciousness for the machine. This is a thought first model, meaning that the nexus is the conscious component, while the other services would be the unconscious mind.

Thanks for watching!
