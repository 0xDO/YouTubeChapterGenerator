The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: probably print out the synopsis too because here let's remove this we'll print out the terms only once so that's fine and then we will um then we'll print out the synopsis so copy that do synopsis and then we'll print grade let's add a little bit of dressing so do grade so that way we get the synopsis and the grade and then um if grade equals five so this is what we're looking for we're looking for a grade five synopsis we'll say uh we'll just um probably save it and print it out or save it uh yeah just save it save a unique ID and file name save file file name synopsis and then we'll do exit exit I can type I promise with Code Zero so code 0 is like the standard exit which is the thing succeeded okay so then we'll call seed only once and then we'll do synopsis gan and let's see if it works so then we'll do CD um CD synopsis generator let me make this a little bit bigger for you properties 30s that's too big okay and so then we'll do python generate synopsis all right and there's all kinds of things that you can do to improve this so we've got this let's see what happens so it's generating a synopsis in the background right now uh let's see oh it's too long you requested 5300 tokens 2300 in your prompt and 3 000 in the Watchman jig okay so we need to shorten our our window which is this right here so let's take this down to a thousand let's try that again a psychological Thriller in Scandinavia in the early classical it's noisy um it's culturally diverse okay so this is a grade four um yeah so you see here it generated one where it just says the novel begins with our protagonist a young woman it doesn't give her a name so yeah we don't we don't like that one because that is no good um let's see synopsis Karen is a young woman of color living in Scandinavia okay that's a little bit better still it's not that long so let's generate another one and so the idea here is that you have a generator and a discriminator so the generator is trying to come up with story ideas and then the discriminators saying that's not quite good enough and then when you look at uh let's see why is this in two interesting um so ideally you will get uh we'll see we'll let it go until it gets until it spits out one that it says is a is a grade five um so we'll see what happens grade four so it's reliably generating uh grade four um and some of these look like they're probably good so I might need to go back and do some work on the um on the actual uh on the on the the grading thing but so here's the idea is with a generator and discriminator the they're both competing against each other so the generator is trying to get better at generating whatever it's trying to do and the discriminator is also trying to get better and so how do you do that right how do you have a discriminator that gets better at discriminating versus a generator that gets better at generating because if the J if the discriminator is just giving a rank how does it know that it's giving a good rank that I'm not sure how to do yet um but we'll see we'll let this go until it gives until it gives us a um until it gives us a rank five um I'll pause this um and let it go until until we're done um because I have no idea how long it's going to take and then we'll we'll evaluate um evaluate what it shows and why okay looking at some of these um I think I've probably got to do some work on my um on my discriminator because these actually look pretty good in this in the town of stromstad Sweden so one it immediately establishes the setting um immigrant families from all over the world have settled the town is a Melting Pot of cultures and traditions the residents are proud of their diversity however there is one family that is not like the other others the kovic family are Romani gypsies um probably shouldn't have used gypsies that is no longer in Vogue you're supposed to say well I guess it said Roma or Romani um they've been living on the outskirts of stromstad for Generations they're a tight-knit community um they stick to their own the residents view the kovics with as dirty and dangerous so this is all good she goes to school makes friends so it's a little girl however the residents of stromstad still view her as an outsider even sure that she's just run away again but Jacob doesn't come home after a few days Eva starts to worry um her own culture she also starts to understand the Prejudice of the kovic's face okay this is great this is a great coming of coming of age um and they're starting slowly starting to accept them okay so I'm going to grab this as a rank five because this is definitely a good good one it is it is good enough um okay the only thing missing is the time period so in the town of Strom said Sweden um the year was supposed to be let's see if we scroll up um psychological Thriller Scandinavia early classical I kind of ignored that um so we'll say like um I guess this could take place at any time period but having having a definitive time period is required um for for a for a story to be good because that's part of setting so there's three primary ingredients to any story it's like three legs of a stool so you need setting plot and character setting is composed of uh location or locations it also has to have culture time period uh language religion whatever whatever's going on whatever's socially going on so it tell it talks about the setting really well um it gives you the name it gives you that but we don't have a time period um and so this could be in let's say the 1970s um settled during the 1970s so we'll make this just a little bit better because that because the time period gives you some anchoring and of course this story could be any time right um and yeah is not as welcoming as she thought this this is good um we can remove the ending because I've got that figured out uh yeah so we got nice and short and then we've got one that is Rock Solid robust um and then we've got one this one is actually okay um so what I'll do is I'll

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the town of Stromstad, Sweden, immigrant families from all over the world have settled. The town is a Melting Pot of cultures and traditions, and the residents are proud of their diversity. However, there is one family that is not like the others - the kovics. The kovics are a Romani gypsy family who have been living on the outskirts of Stromstad for generations. They are a tight-knit community who stick to their own. The residents of Stromstad view the kovics with as dirty and dangerous.

Karen is a young woman of color living in Scandinavia. She goes to school and makes friends, but the residents of Stromstad still view her as an outsider. When her friend Jacob goes missing, Eva starts to worry. Through her own culture, she also starts to understand the prejudice the kovics face. Slowly, the town starts to accept them.
