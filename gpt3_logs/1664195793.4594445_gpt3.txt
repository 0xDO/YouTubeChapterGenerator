The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: but let's see seed so we'll get some we'll start we'll start with some entropy I actually found you don't want to call seed repeatedly because then you kind of even though even though it does introduce some entropy you're basically starting over and so you end up with um it'll often make similar choices whoops cancel what I don't know what I did okay um it'll often make similar choices um so you just call seed once or intermittently okay so then we say um seed words equals open file um and we'll do common words dot text split lines and so what this will do is it will open this my Precision is loaded I changed my mouse resolution um so it'll open this and we will grab actually no I don't need I need sample sample okay um and so then uh let's see sampling equals sample um I think it you put it in seed words and then 10 and then we'll do print sampling all right let's make sure I did that right python 20 questions there we go okay so basically what we'll do is we will start with a random sampling and then we will build a prompt from that um so the prompt equals we'll start with string um string EU id4 take that out did I um it didn't print it out that's fine um string uuid4 and then we will do um four S in sampling all right we don't we can obfuscate this and actually we'll just do it this way all right so prompt equals that so for S and sampling or yeah sample seed words 10 we'll do um come back here and look at my history yeah that's what it was come back a little ways I did a whole bunch of these good grief I did way more than I thought I did how many times did I click on this darn thing oh I went back too far there we go okay so we want it to look like this oops so we'll just pick a random word um let's see prompt equals prompt plus and we'll do new line um pick a random word uh percent s and then sample and that should end up giving us this so it'll be perfect and then we'll do prompt equals and we'll just do the same thing but instead we will exclude that and that is going to be the prompt so then we'll just do print prompt yeah cool Mahatma Gandhi Christopher Columbus why are they missing spaces oh whoops I removed all spaces okay so here's a here's a regex trick um you see how a lot of these have a space at the beginning but then they they have spaces here and what I did was I accidentally removed all spaces so what we need to do is we need to remove only spaces at the beginning so what you do is you do carrot which tells it start at the beginning of the string and then you do backslash s for white space and then you do replace all and so that replaced only the spaces at the beginning while preserving the rest all right Confucius Julius Irving salt tomatoes onions Street Pasta House computer milk it's a lot of food I think I just have a lot of food um but this is easy right it's supposed to be easy enough to play with a kid um so we'll go with it for now um but we can also generate plenty more common words and places and things if we want but we gotta we got a good mix okay so now let's plug this into um into our playground do a quick refresh okay and then turn the temperature back up blue ship spoon sunflower soup you see we're not getting the United States of America every other turn Boat fish spice spaghetti boat Dairy truck salmon Dallas Cowboys soup desk Eiffel Tower gospel soap all right soap pops up a lot but so anyways because we're picking a random sampling every time the the profile of what we're gonna is gonna also be different every time um okay so I'm satisfied with that so let's come back into here yeah we don't need that anymore because we've got our prompt so we we're basically just dynamically generating a unique prompt every single time um okay so then um our stop sequence will be we need backslash n to be one of our stop sequences Okay so secret word equals gpt3 completion prompt will also set we'll set the default temperature to let's say 1.2 um so yeah so we've got that we don't need a thousand tokens we'll do we'll we'll leave it to like 100 tokens um for this one Okay so we've we pick a secret word and so then we'll just do print secret word uh just to make sure that it works oh whoops I need to create my gpt3 logs directory I always forget to do this gpt3 lawns crocodile good one computer Jimi Hendrix yes okay I am satisfied that this is a good we're getting a good amount of entropy okay so obviously we don't want to tell you the secret word so then okay uh print um I have picked my secret word um ask your first question and so we'll do um questions remaining equals 20. and we'll probably do something like um questions remaining dollar s and then we'll add percent questions remaining um and we'll just have this in the debug out or in the output every time um okay so then we say while true so we enter into our infinite Loop um the user the read host um let me make sure I remember how to use read oh I'm sorry I forgot to make this bigger sorry everyone's probably squinting at the screen saying Dave make it bigger I can't see there sorry about that okay uh Python and then a equals I think it's just read um read host is Powershell um and then we'll say um ask your question scrub or is it input a equals input ask yeah um bacon and then print a okay it's input not read okay um fair enough so then you say so the the round starts you ask your question so um question equals input um we'll just say user and we'll start there or no um question there much better so then because that'll look like this question are you alive okay good enough um all right so question equals input so now we need to do some prompt engineering where we've got a secret word um here I'll leave the printing of the secret word right now um debug just so that I can whoops now python 1T question s oh I added a that's not supposed to be there like what did I do wrong Machu Picchu okay um good so if I if I at first we need to test is it a good question um so let's just say um uh let's see a user is

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro shows us how to generate a random prompt using Python. He starts by seed entropy, which is a random number that is used to start the process. He then opens a file of common words and splits them into a list. From there, he randomly samples 10 words from the list and prints them out. Next, he builds a prompt from the list of words. The prompt is a string of the form "Pick a random word: %s" where %s is replaced by a word from the list. He then prints the prompt and we see that it generates a variety of different prompts, such as "Machu Picchu" and "Christopher Columbus." Finally, he shows us how to plug the prompt into a Python script.
