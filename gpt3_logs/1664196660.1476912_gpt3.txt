TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with another video we're going to talk boundaries and consent with gpd3 i'm trying a new format of video where i use um gpthree as a way to help teach um things that i want to teach the world but also at the same time i'll teach you how to use gpt3 okay what is the definition of a boundary let's see what it says a boundary is a line that marks the limits of an area okay that's a boundary let's change this to say personal boundary what is a personal boundary is thinking thinking thinking a personal boundary is a line that delineates what is and is not acceptable in terms of physical and emotional intimacy perfect okay i like that um what is the definition of consent consent is an agreement between two people to gauge in sexual activity okay um what is the let's say full definition of consent okay it is clearly been um contaminated by the previous thing so uh let's see consent is voluntary enthusiastic and ongoing agreement to engage in sexual activity it is important to remember that consent can be withdrawn at any time okay this is all true but this is not the full definition of consent so let's remove that and i'll show you how what was above it the full definition can is agreement to do something see how the definition changes drastically let me copy that and then do go back a little bit oh it doesn't require keep it okay so anyways you can see that uh what you write beforehand changes the next output okay write a formal definition of consent okay yeah consent is an agreement to do something it is given voluntarily and with knowledge of what is being agreed to okay cool that is a good broad definition of consent write a formal definition of a personal boundary a personal boundary is a line that separates one person from another it is a limit on how close one person can get physically or emotionally great um okay uh write a summary of the book let's see write a brief summary of the book the power of a positive no by william hurry uh he uh let's see in the power of a positive no william murray provides readers with a seven step process for saying no effectively he argues that the ability to say no is a critical skill for anyone who wants to be successful in life or he offers readers specific strategies for handling difficult conversations setting boundaries and maintaining relationships the book also includes case studies and real world examples to illustrate the principles uri discusses okay yeah i would say that's that's fine the only thing is that i don't necessarily agree with the seven step process because he actually outlines a three-step process which is yes no yes um explain uri's yes no yes method for establishing boundaries let's see it involves saying no to a request but then following up with a positive response for example if someone asks you to do something you don't want to do you can say no but then offer an alternative suggestion yes that is correct this method can be used to maintain relationships while setting clear boundaries perfect okay so taking a big step back we defined boundaries earlier as a you know a line that should not be crossed [Music] and then we also defined consent as something that you is agreed to why is consent important in work relationships let's see consent is important in work relationships because it establishes a clear and mutual understanding of expectations roles and boundaries it helps to prevent misunderstandings and can make communication and collaboration more efficient and effective when all parties involved in a work relationship have given their consent it can uh help create a more positive and productive work environment yes 100 percent i think that everyone in any kind of professional capacity should understand consent that's me personally um how does this relate to consensus so this is something that i use both in my personal life and in my work life whenever i'm conducting a meeting i don't ever like you know tell people this is the conclusion agree with me i ask people um what they believe and why and we work towards consensus i'm always open to being wrong now more often than not you know i come into a meeting with some preconceived ideas and we talk through it and sometimes you know the group comes to consensus that my idea was right sometimes that's not always true though sometimes i go into a meeting and i say like i have no clue what i'm doing so anyways let's see how how consent and consensus are related consensus is a process of reaching agreement between different parties in order to achieve consensus all parties involved must be willing to compromise and negotiate this process can be difficult but it is important in work relationships in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page and everyone agrees with the final decision so consent and consensus have a very similar meaning um let's say compare and contrast the words consent and consensus um consensus explore their etymologies and roots as well as their colloquial um usage and everyday and semantic meanings and it's thinking the word consent comes from the word constantire which means to feel together the word consensus comes from the latin word consensum which means agreement both words are used to refer to a situation in which two or more parties agree on something however consent is often used to refer to a situation where one party agrees to do something while consensus is often used to refer to a situation where our all parties have involved the sorry which all parties involved agreed to do something um yes so the implication there is consent is often between two parties uh whereas consensus is between many parties again you know i don't know if that's perfect but it did a really good job doing this very quickly let's see how might the issue of consent come up between romantic partners in a non-sexual context what are some examples where a couple may need to discuss consent okay so one example might be if one partner wants to

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Consent is important in all aspects of a romantic relationship, not just sexual activity. Couples need to discuss their expectations, roles, and boundaries with each other to prevent misunderstandings. They also need to be willing to compromise and negotiate with each other. Consent is needed for any activity that could potentially be harmful to either partner, such as going on vacation, getting a new job, or having a baby.
