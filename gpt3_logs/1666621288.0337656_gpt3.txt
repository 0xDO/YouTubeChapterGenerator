0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:18:23.460,0:18:32.100
that also help or I guess prevent um you know
agreement or that utility um so what uh what I
0:18:32.100,0:18:36.000
would like to do is ask what are some of those
what are some of those limitations and what are
0:18:36.000,0:18:40.980
some of the solutions conceptual solutions
to the limitations of human language or even
0:18:41.580,0:18:47.640
um uh formal logic as well okay I would not say
that the language natural language is limited
0:18:47.640,0:18:52.920
is actually I would say they're all deposites so
the natural language is too powerful indeed I can
0:18:52.920,0:18:57.600
say whatever kind of concept I'll ask that as it
could be in natural language and explain it to you
0:18:58.200,0:19:05.640
so the problem is exactly this one if you want
to translate a communication so a a movement of
0:19:05.640,0:19:09.600
information from an engine to another one from
an agent to the centralized system whatever
0:19:09.600,0:19:19.260
we need to be sure that we understand each
other and in the context of Concepts which
0:19:19.260,0:19:23.220
are known so when we communicate say
as human natural language for example
0:19:23.880,0:19:30.720
uh we need to know two things we need to speak the
same language both English speaker for example but
0:19:30.720,0:19:35.220
also we need to have the same conceptualization
of the world so we have to not only to understand
0:19:35.220,0:19:41.040
English but you have to understand the meaning
of words when I say elephant I want I need you
0:19:41.040,0:19:46.320
to be sure that you know what an elephant means
maybe if you are a child that never left your your
0:19:46.320,0:19:52.380
village whatever in Northern Carolina then maybe
you never you never seen an elephant maybe you
0:19:52.380,0:19:55.920
never know you don't even know what an elephant
is so it's not only a problem of knowing English
0:19:55.920,0:20:04.500
is having Concepts Associated to words and if you
talk if you put a an agent which is a computer in
0:20:04.500,0:20:12.060
in this game of course I may try to teach the
computer the grammar the language the English
0:20:12.060,0:20:16.860
language for example it's very hard because
it's uh there are so many variations but the
0:20:16.860,0:20:23.280
heartbeat is to be sure that the computer the
agent understands the concepts and for example
0:20:23.280,0:20:31.800
this is the major limitation of language models in
in AI based on neural networks nowadays like gpt3
0:20:31.800,0:20:38.160
and stuff so they they circumvent the problem of
the complexity of lung of the syntax of the fact
0:20:38.160,0:20:44.820
that that the language is very many things can
be seen as many many any any concept from the
0:20:44.820,0:20:49.200
express is many more different in many different
ways and and it's very hard to enumerate all
0:20:49.200,0:20:54.900
of them so what gpt3 does and all this language
natural language models based on deep learning AI
0:20:55.440,0:21:03.240
uh they were just digest all the possible
sentences ever uttered on the internet so
0:21:03.240,0:21:08.760
that statistically they they basically get an
idea on how the language is built but the major
0:21:08.760,0:21:15.720
limitation which is a center of very interesting
debate in AI with Gary Marks and stuff is what
0:21:15.720,0:21:22.380
what the computer understands about the concepts
which are embedded in the words so you can connect
0:21:22.380,0:21:29.400
words in apparently meaningful sentences because
they resonate well to our cognition but they they
0:21:29.400,0:21:35.280
really the agent would never understand exactly
the content so that's why when we deal with
0:21:35.280,0:21:43.380
natural language we have to focus on on meaningful
fragments of it so we we will never allow complete
0:21:43.380,0:21:51.540
natural language freely spoken so because we want
to be certain that we understand hundred percent
0:21:52.380,0:21:59.580
of what any agent or any of the million ages is
going to say so this means that the the computer
0:21:59.580,0:22:07.980
eventually the the say the software that controls
um Tau this communication which is also generated
0:22:07.980,0:22:13.080
by discussion in Tau Etc but this is not the
story but we have to be sure that the definition
0:22:13.080,0:22:19.860
the meaning of all the concepts and the words is
present in the agent in the main agent itself and
0:22:19.860,0:22:25.020
so this means that maybe at the beginning Tau will
be very stupid we'll understand very few Concepts
0:22:25.020,0:22:31.080
and the conversation among agents will teach the
computer more Concepts but in the real sense right
0:22:31.080,0:22:35.940
so definitions what is an elephant well is an
animal that lives in some countries it's gray
