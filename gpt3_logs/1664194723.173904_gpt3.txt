The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with a video um on using gpt3 to create uh fiction so here are just a few tips and tricks that i use to uh to generate you know dialogue or whatever so first is the brainstorm brainstorm some ideas for a funny scene between let's use characters that uh gpt3 is going to know between spider-man and mary jane and then i'll just go ahead and give it a dash so the purpose of this dash is to tell it to do a list whoops then ctrl enter okay so let's see um it likes uh if you so um first thing if you use imperative verbs like brainstorm or imagine um gpt3 does really well with that um so it is really helpful to open with an imperative uh thing not just write right because you know write or create or generate that's where i started but if you can be more specific you'll get better results so i want it to brainstorm that's the behavior i want alright so it says spiderman and mary jane are sitting in a cafe spider-man is trying to read a book but keeps getting interrupted by people coming up to him and asking for pictures mary jane is trying to talk to him but he's not paying attention that's kind of mean um spider-man and mary jane are at a fancy restaurant mary jane is trying to eat her food but spider-man keeps stealing her food off her plate i can imagine him doing that with a spider silk um also he's unironically dressed as spider-man in public spider-man and mary jane are in bed but he won't stop talking okay that's kind of lame spider-man and mary jane are at a park is right mary jane is trying to read a book but spider-man keeps climbing on her and hanging off of her spiderman i'm not a lamppost okay so you also see this where there's no space this is another aberration so let me take a screenshot of that so i can send it off to the gpt3 folks because they want to see this kind of stuff this is one of those weird things okay so let's grab one of these i think that this last one is the most absurd so let's grab that one and i'll say uh let's see um imagine a scene let's see imagine the following scene right the screenplay uh dialogue for this scene scene okay um be creative so then we'll just prompt it to start with spider-man and we'll hit go see what it does okay so it says hey mj what are you reading mary jane just a book what kind of book a romance novel ooh can i read it with you no spider-man this is my alone time but i'm lonely go swing on some web or something but i don't want to well i'm sorry but you're just gonna have to find something else to do fine okay so let's see he was clingy but not climbing on her hanging off of her that's okay so let's restart this let me show you how temperature might affect this let's see what happens if we turn up the temperature [Laughter] okay makes him sound like a little kid come on mary jane play with me spider-man i'm trying to read but i'm bored well why don't you go swing on the swing or something okay um so we're still not quite getting what we want right um because that behavior that it brainstormed of like climbing on someone is really difficult so here's another thing that i do i will often use the next line as a stop so spider-man and mary jane so we'll use those as stops um so let's see so hey mj what you're reading and so then we'll just manually type it in mary jane see what she says just a book spider-man i'm wondering why why it doesn't call her call him peter parker okay we'll say we'll change this to peter let's see spider-man uses webs to um yank the book away um mary jane let's see what she says to this hey give that back spider-man only for a kiss okay so he's being he's being trying to be sweet that's that's what's emerging from this scene no way spider-man i'm not kissing and so it also does this thing where um you see how it like adds a few new lines even though it's supposed to be continuing this i'm not sure why it does that no way spider-man i'm not kissing you let's see pouting oh why not and also sorry i keep bumping the microphone let me move it just a little bit there we go okay he climbs on her back like a spider [Laughter] get off me you're so annoying okay so now let's from since we've since we've given it something to go off of usually gpt3 can cue off of something if you've already got it started so let's just go ahead and see where it cut where it goes with this looks sullen okay um well this ended up being very very wholesome i'm not sure if i agree with this i mean sure it's uh you know it's it's nice that they they reconciled very quickly [Music] let's let's change this a little um so let's add something to the prompt the scene escalates into a f uh let's say argument because argument is a safer word than fight it's also more specific so again you got to be specific because if you say it escalates to a fight you and i might know that like okay that means a couple's argument or a couple's quarrel but because it's spider-man gpt-3 might be like oh he starts beating up mary jane and of course that's not safe um did i misspell argument and argument there we go escalates into an argument so let's just change this one thing and see how that changes the outcome slaps him yeah so you see how like it uh you know it's okay with violence um so even just saying it escalates into an argument but it drastically changed the outcome you love it he leans in to kiss her she slaps him leave me alone um okay so instead of saying it escalates into an argument let's say it escalates into a comical misunderstanding let's see how that goes okay this is this is so painfully cringe um but i'm just showing you like how modifying one little thing at a time will uh we'll do this okay so let's go back let's leave the same prompt but let's change the engine so let's go back to um davinci instruct beta so da vinci instruct beta was before it was more aligned so it is instruct beta tends to be a little bit more creative although sometimes it goes off the rails so let's see what happens on instruct beta am i too

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I'm going to show you how to use GPT3 to generate fictional dialogue.

First, you need to brainstorm some ideas for a scene. For this example, I'm going to use Spider-Man and Mary Jane.

Next, you need to tell GPT3 what you want it to do. You can do this by using imperative verbs like "brainstorm" or "imagine."

Once you've done this, GPT3 will generate a list of possible scenarios. For this example, I'm going to use the scenario where Spider-Man and Mary Jane are in bed but he won't stop talking.

To make the scene more realistic, you can add details like what the characters are wearing or what they're doing.

Once you're happy with the scene, you can hit "Ctrl + Enter" to generate the dialogue.

And that's it! By following these simple steps, you can use GPT3 to create realistic and believable dialogue for your fictional characters.
