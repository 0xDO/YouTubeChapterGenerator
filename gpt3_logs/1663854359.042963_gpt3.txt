how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:10:27.760,0:10:32.960
of text because you know gpt3 doesn't understand
python lists but it does understand text
0:10:33.600,0:10:40.000
then we'll feed it in and we'll get the response
and then we'll say summaries dot append response
0:10:40.880,0:10:44.000
okay but then what are we going to do
okay we have all these responses together
0:10:45.040,0:10:52.160
what's the big deal so let me tell you what the
big deal is we will oh and actually let me add
0:10:53.840,0:11:00.400
that so that way each each one has its own little
dash at the beginning so then what we're going to
0:11:00.400,0:11:05.120
do is we're going to take all those summaries
and we're going to do it one last time because
0:11:05.120,0:11:12.160
in the prompt we say detailed summary detail
detailed we want we want to know all the details
0:11:12.160,0:11:20.240
so we'll keep we'll use the same exact prompt and
so this is like a meta-summary um and we'll say uh
0:11:22.640,0:11:26.880
here we'll just copy copy some of the
stuff that works text block equals
0:11:26.880,0:11:33.200
join but instead of subset we're going to do
we're going to join summaries and then we will
0:11:33.840,0:11:41.840
do the same thing so we'll get one final
meta summary at the very end and let's do
0:11:44.080,0:11:52.800
we'll do a couple of dashes new line new line
and then new line new line so that way it'll
0:11:52.800,0:11:58.800
just kind of separate it all out okay so let's run
this and basically what we'll see is we'll see it
0:11:58.800,0:12:04.880
do 10 or 11 i can't remember the exact logic if
it includes or excludes the last number i don't
0:12:04.880,0:12:11.920
remember that's fine either way point being is we
should get enough to see some patterns emerging um
0:12:12.720,0:12:17.200
and then there's all kinds of other stuff we can
do with these right we can change this prompt to
0:12:17.840,0:12:22.400
uh you know to say like not just what they love
and hate but just what are they saying about it
0:12:22.400,0:12:30.320
um and then we can also ask we could ask gpt3
to infer recommended changes to the product
0:12:30.320,0:12:33.280
right actually that's not a bad
idea let's go ahead and do that
0:12:34.800,0:12:38.400
so rather than have this prompt let's say um
