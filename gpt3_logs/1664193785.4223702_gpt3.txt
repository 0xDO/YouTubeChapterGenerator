TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video today we are going to be synthesizing emails now I have seen dozens if not hundreds of people asking on the openai community and Reddit um how to synthesize emails and I want to do this for all kinds of emails right most for the most part people are like oh well there's copy Ai and and other things that it's like it's kind of kind of generic though um I had this idea for a while ago because um I work in technology and you know some technologists are grumpy some of us have bad days um I have gotten very good at writing diplomatic emails I have a whole bunch of rules in my head that I use for writing perfect emails um you know bottom line up front which is your subject line should have a statement of fact or a question or a problem right whoever is getting your email they should know exactly what you need as close as possible just from the subject line for instance um that sort of stuff so uh but then there's there's marketing copy there's emails to friends and family there's emails to whoever right um so there's a few things that that need to happen when you're writing an email um and also let me warn you this is going to be a long video I'll try and cut it down in post but no promises this could be a very long one um close this from my last video um yeah so the first thing that we need to do when we're generating uh emails is we need to have a bunch of different intents um and so what is an email intent it is um it is like who am I emailing to what am I talking about and so on and so what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to do a couple quick experiments to um actually let me make sure this is recording right okay yes um to to work on a prompt so the first thing is we're going to make a prompt to help us generate an email intent um uuid so what I'm going to do is I also what I've started doing is I just put a uuid um up front because that increases the internal entropy of the machine and you'll get better uh better Randomness um so let's see uh imagine um uh let's see a scenario let's see imagine um yeah we'll say a scenario where one person is writing an email to another um describe the scenario in a paragraph um so let's see here are some uh ideas to help uh format all right to help uh form the scenario okay so um we'll say inform the scenario and so then we'll then what I'll do here is I'll have a whole bunch of modifiers um and so this is a way to add even more entropy if you've watched my other videos you'll know that one thing that I do is I will have placeholders in the prompts and then I'll I'll rotate through those placeholders um and so then in this case let's say like um let's see email to boss um ask for raise something like that right um and then uh so that that's that's that and then we'll say scenario and then we'll just like let's say you're emailing your boss for raise you have been with the company for a year and feel you've contributed a lot um your boss responds and says that he will think about it okay so I didn't want it to I didn't want it to give the whole scenario um so I need to fix this prompt uh let's see imagine where uh where one person is writing an email to another um describe the scenario in a paragraph uh let's see actually describe describe the outgoing email so we need this is this is an exercise in being specific um describes the outgoing email in a paragraph okay and so then we'll change this to email um yeah I know that wasn't right okay so we do we do want we do want it to say a scenario you feel you're being underpaid and asked for a raise of 5 000 okay okay good it's getting it's getting some some good entropy writing this just a few times 500 per month good and then so here also when you're doing synthetic data I often turn the temperature up higher um yep cool okay so this is obviously getting a little bit repetitive there will be more entropy when I when we fill this out um but this is definitely good enough um so then we'll do a placeholder here so we'll do uh nope that's the uuid and then we'll do a placeholder here for modifier okay and then we'll delete this and so basically this is going to be this is not the helper bot one this is the perfect email generator so this will be prompt to form intents and so then what I'll do is um we will go to the script that I copied from uh previous one and we'll just modify this so this is a super simple script all it does is it loads a prompt um and then uh actually no this was this was a little bit different um so we're going to well first we can just clear all all this out because I don't think I need to reuse this but the rest of it I can reuse okay uh so then we need to have a list of modifiers up here so we'll say um modifiers equals and then we'll do um uh let's see so we have all kinds of intents we say um uh let's see um how did I how did I do it in this example email to boss ask for raise okay email to boss asked for raise um and then you know actually because I'm gonna have I'm gonna aim for 400 different things so I don't want to have like yeah there's gonna be some variants but like each one of these is only going to give me about five good good different things of variance because ideally it would invent these modifiers on its own let me think about this for a second I'm going to pause I'm going to pause the recording and think about how to how to how to fully offload the creative process because I want gpt3 to write these modifiers for me let me think about this for a second okay I think I figured it out um so what I'm going to do first actually is those intents I'm going to get gpt3 to generate a list of intents and what I'll do is I'll I'll give it just a list of types so what I did here was I just did a quick thing where I said imagine a list of any reasons to write an email and I gave it a couple of examples um and so then what I'll do is I'll do a modifier so I'll say like uh work related um and so then we'll I'll just uh
