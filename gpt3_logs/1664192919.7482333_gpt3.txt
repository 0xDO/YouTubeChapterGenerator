CLEAR ESSAY:

First, they looked at the pre-constitutional common law history in England, which showed that abortion was largely prohibited in most American states as of 1868. They also considered the principle of stere decisis, which requires respect for the court's precedence and for the accumulated wisdom of the judges who have previously addressed the same issue. The court found that Roe was an egregiously wrong decision that had caused significant negative consequences and that overruling it would not unduly
