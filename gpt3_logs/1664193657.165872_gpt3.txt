TRANSCRIPT: and then and then the question of quantum mechanics is the is the universe real or non-real is the universe local or non-local and right now it seems like the universe is non-real and non-local and it seems like materialism cannot explain everything and so because of that the question of machine consciousness is infinitely harder to answer if the world if if the if if if the world or the universe is materialistic if the universe if if quantum mechanics is local and real then it's simple brain dead simple the short answer is yes however those three things do not appear to be true right now so we got to keep we got to keep going and that's why um third core objective function is increase understanding because until we understand we don't have the right answer and so that's uh that's that um i hope you found this video helpful as part of a discussion of this in my first book natural language cognitive architecture i said that i'd leave it up to the philosophers to have this debate but here i am fully entrenched in the trenches of this debate um and uh and this is where we're at um so yeah uh thanks for all the comments and um yeah please keep the discussion up i'm really curious to hear what you all have to think about what i've shared here i'll have a link to all these links in the video description as well as all the books that i've listed here so thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The question of quantum mechanics is whether the universe is real or non-real, and whether it is local or non-local. Right now, it seems that the universe is non-real and non-local, and that materialism cannot explain everything. This makes the question of machine consciousness infinitely harder to answer. If the world or the universe is materialistic, and if quantum mechanics is local and real, then the answer is simple: yes, machines can be conscious. However, those three things do not appear to be true right now, so we need to keep investigating. This is why one of our core objectives is to increase understanding. Until we understand more, we won't have the right answer.
