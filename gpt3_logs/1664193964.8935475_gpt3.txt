The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody good morning david shapiro here for another video um we are going to pick up on auto muse so last time quick review this is the second video last time we left off with we kind of ran into a problem because because each each of the chunks got successively larger and so what i mean by that is if we look at the data so what what we're trying to do here is we're trying to like build up a book through successive chunks and so what we do is we include the outline and then the most recent um well here let me copy uh this will be easier if i just show you kind of like the whole thing um okay here we go that was a summary actually i apologize um sorry we're all getting recalibrated here um oh well i can just show you the prompt okay so here's the prompt that we're filling out this will make the most sense oh let me zoom in so you can see it hold on hold on there we go okay so this is the prompt that we're filling out because and this is this is the prompt that we're going to be fine-tuning also let me make sure that you can hear me hello okay cool um i replaced the the cable on my microphone to me when i record it still sounds quiet but y'all will let me know if it's if it's too loud too quiet the gain is turned way up i think this microphone is just dying anyways sorry for the aside um okay down to business the outline so in order to write a story we're having to imagine like okay it's got the plan um because if you just like give it you know give it the reins it'll kind of just wander wherever but uh in a past experiment um i generated a whole bunch of plot premises so let me show you those so here's an example in a high fantasy world there's a war brewing between the humans and the elves right okay so here's a whole plot premise the humans are forced to flee back to their world where they must start rebuilding their kingdom right so this is this is a story premise um and you take that so you put that here and then um the story so far so this is like just a natural language summary of what has happened in the story and then here's a chunk of prose like so that what's actually been written and then what we're going to ask it to do is write the next chunk and so what i've been doing is i've been getting all of this scraped together so we've got outlines we've got story so far last chunks we've got all that accumulated here so we've got chunks so i've got alice excuse me alice in wonderland frankenstein and all these different stories split into 1500 character chunks right so we give it one chunk after another and so that way it can kind of keep writing right it's like an inchworm inching along um but the idea is we want to train it with existing novels so that that way it can learn to write entire novels now the problem was as we get further into the story the summary of what's happened so far gets longer and longer and longer so let me show you the script that i used to do this um i think it was this one yeah so did i do 1500 i did not okay so this is um there's a well let's let's go through all the all the all the um things so far okay see this is the problem of coming back to code is like where was i where was i what was i doing okay um book to chunk so this was the first script and basically all it did was um break each book so we started here we took these are the whole books from downloaded from gutenberg so i took the books and broke them down into chunks so that's that's the first step that's all that this first script does is it generates the chunks and they're in they're in sequential order um so you know it's just manageable manageable chunks of pros um and then summarize chunks so for this what i did was i just took the first like 11 chunks um or sorry 40 chunks um and and summarize them so the summaries are here and so it's uh it's summarizing each chunk and it's it's a one to one so if we go to alice in wonderland 15 um in the chunks the summary is going to be a summary of that chunk so was it 15 so thought alice i dare say it's a french mouse come with william the conqueror blah blah blah so then you read this alice encounters a mouse who's terrified of cats the mouse explains that his family has always hated cats and he doesn't want to hear their name again um so yeah you can see it took what 1500 almost 1600 characters and summarized it down to 154 so that's a compression factor of 15 to 1. so the idea was we would take these summaries and we would so you see here where i pick up the summaries so summaries equals i for i and os list are summaries if name is an i and the name is the name of the book so basically what i do here is i just grab the summaries for this book outline so that i open i open the outline of it and then we accumulate the summaries so then for each summary in summaries we're going to accumulate the summary chunk make it longer and longer last chunk equals so the last chunk is goes here so this would be like so alice in wonderland 15 so it'd be this one and then the next chunk would be what we want it to write next um so that would be chunk 16. um so we just iterate get the next chunk but the problem was even with these even with these short summaries you accumulate 100 of them it gets to be really long because 100 times 154 is 15 000 characters that's not going to fit into a gpt3 prompt so that's where we got stuck last time okay so class in review so what we need to do is we need to summarize this so the summary chunk if the summary chunk is too long we need to summarize the summary chunk um and i had an idea i could have sworn that i put in the code but so the idea that i had um was if summary chunk oops gotta do length summary chunk greater than fifteen hundred um then what we'll do is we will ah we need to grab this function gpt 3 prompt also that means we'll need those functions okay so just copy this this in here um and what we're gonna do let's make this a little bit longer just so that we don't run out of space is we will get yeah okay so

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the last video, we left off with a problem: each successive chunk of the story was getting larger and larger. This made it difficult for the computer to generate a coherent story.

To solve this problem, I came up with the idea of summarizing the chunks. That way, the computer would only have to generate a short summary, rather than the entire chunk.

To do this, I created a function that would take a chunk and summarize it. I then applied this function to the entire story. This resulted in a much shorter story that was easier for the computer to generate.

Now that we have a shorter story, we can ask the computer to generate the next chunk. This will help us create a complete story.
