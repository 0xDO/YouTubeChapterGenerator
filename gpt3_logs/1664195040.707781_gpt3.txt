The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: good morning everybody david shapiro here with another video so i recently did a decreasingly verbose thing um which is a really it's called a recursive summarizer so let me show you what this does real quick um recursive summarizer uh i've got another video of this so i'm not going to go into too much detail if you want to see how this works um you can you can do it but basically all it does is it breaks up any file into chunks and then makes those chunks smaller and then sticks them back together i fed alice in wonderland into this and it got it down to this is the summary of alice in wonderland alice falls down a rabbit hole and has some adventures so i did that about four or five times and each chunk was smaller and smaller and this is the summary that it got it's just an iterative it's a recursive summarizer that's exactly what it says on the tin okay so with all that said um i got the idea to what if we do this in reverse what if we make things longer so enter in increasingly verbose so this is based on a subreddit which is a it's a meme subreddit and basically it's like um people people just keep adding stuff and making it longer so like in this case like our slash suicide by words kamikaze by qwerty death by diction unlive by literature um i don't know if that's technically increasingly verbose but it's increasingly grandiloquent um but yeah so anyways point being is that there's this like meme of like making things longer okay so i started experimenting with it um let me show you first the limitations so here's the original prompt um i worked on this prompt um this is like the fifth version and they all ended up with the same problem and that is that they would end up kind of maximizing out and not expanding further so i said like nihilism bad and then you just go and it says okay nihilism is bad for several reasons etc etc and even with the temperature higher um it kind of reaches a maximum limit um okay so we say nihilism bad i say expand on this so this is really great if you're trying to write a book or a paper on something and you just say take this idea and expand on it so it says like nihilism is bad for several reasons it leads to a sense of despair and hopelessness without something to believe in etc etc so then we put this in so we just recursively do it say okay then we'll do that again but you see nihilism is bad for several reasons for one it can lead to a sense of despair and hopelessness ah so here we go it did add a little bit more this time um but eventually what's going to happen well and so here's the thing um it changes based on topic because some topics it can expand on infinitely um and and it but sometimes it gets caught in this trap and sometimes it doesn't where it will just stop um okay so let's see if this one next one is any longer you see it's just kind of like repeating itself and then adding some to the end um all in all you see it's the same pattern over and over again and it looks like okay we've maxed them out we've maximized it out nihilism is harmful system of belief that should be avoided okay so it's just gonna stuck it's gonna get stuck repeating the same thing over and over again so i was like well that's no good i mean sure i started with two words nihilism bad and i ended up with you know three whole paragraphs right of elaboration but if you use your brain you can elaborate on this like talk about the history of nihilism talk about the history of it's you know the modern implications who have who has written about it so now i realized it was time to break this down into into smaller problems so um if you're familiar with my channel you know that one of the things that i research is cognition and so the reason one of the reasons that gpt3 gets frustrating to some people is because they think that a task even though you can describe it in one sentence it's actually still multiple cognitive tasks and so what i realized i had to do is i had to break this down into the cognitive subtasks because when you're rewriting something you're not just you're not just saying oh let me just keep typing no you have to brainstorm ideas about what to add so that's exactly what i did so let me copy this out just to save it for posterity's sake so you can see like this passage is the selection is 1574 characters and the output is um 1697 so it's a little bit longer but not much right and it's like but it's also following the same format it's like no we really want to like take it to the next level so it's like okay how do we take this to the next level still not bad we went from you know two words to three paragraphs pretty quick okay cool but like i want to i want to start with a premise like one sentence and i want to write an entire book okay i want to write an entire book from one premise so let's go let's see if we can do it okay so what i did was i started with a brainstorm passage or a brainstorm prompt sorry so then i was like all right so we're breaking this down into two cognitive tasks so we take the passage let's go back and get the passage so we got this one tada and you can see it like okay that 600 characters is only 379 tokens that's not that big a deal especially because and i'll show you in my script where i break these chunks into smaller smaller chunks so even if it gets to like 5 000 tokens or 50 000 tokens it's still going to do it piece by piece by piece okay so let me show you what this prompt does brainstorm some ideas about how to expand the following passage brainstorming is something that gpt3 is phenomenal at so let's see what ideas it comes up with and i'm going to add that so it knows nihilism can lead to a sense of apathy and detachment nihilism can lead to a sense of insecurity and mental instability nihilism can lead to a feeling of emptiness and purpose purposelessness okay that's okay but it's not quite good enough brainstorm many ideas um uh let's see let's see many different ideas so we're using two adjectives here many

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I show how to use a recursive summarizer to decrease the verbosity of a text. I then discuss the idea of using the same technique in reverse to make a text longer. I demonstrate the limitations of this approach by showing how it often results in repeating the same information. Finally, I suggest a way to overcome this limitation by breaking the task down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
