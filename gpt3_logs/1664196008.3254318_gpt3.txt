TRANSCRIPT: that ended up spreading um the ones that that looked at a dead animal and and and thought hey i wonder if i could come up with a way to hunt that animal you know and they they sharpened some sticks and and and figured out how to make slings right so curiosity the desire to understand uh applies to raven as well as all other life as well as humans and so that means that raven is going to make decisions that that one increase human understanding as well as raven's own understanding so raven is going to look for opportunities to learn and the the last part about uh objective function three is that the more that you understand the more that the humans understand the more that raven understands about the world the better raven will be at reducing suffering and increasing prosperity so think about your doctor right 200 years ago medical science was just beginning and you know your doctor may or may not kill you but today because of increased understanding you trust your doctor your doctor is able to reduce your suffering when you're sick and safeguard your health which also increases prosperity another example would be uh modern uh electrical engineering right electrical engineering gives you the power that your computer is using it gives you your computer uh it gives you uh electricity and and air conditioning so basically increasing understanding is one of the best ways to reduce suffering and increase prosperity and so that's why these three functions work together to form a positive feedback loop and also i want to reiterate that raven every action that raven takes must satisfy all three core objective functions there's no well it does two so maybe we can let go of the third one no because you can take any individual function to a really dark place for instance a previous example of one of my very earliest experiments with the core objective functions was it was that it generated this was back on gpt2 it said that we should kill all humans that are in pain well that would technically reduce suffering but that's kind of evil right and so you don't want to just kill people that are in pain because you don't learn anything from that either right like you don't just euthanize people because they break their ankle you fix it you learn how to fix broken people you learn you you alleviate their suffering and you want to increase their prosperity right because if you just kill someone if someone just dies they're not prosperous anymore they're not able to work or contribute or learn and so you know losing life stands against objective function two and three right and so by by making by forcing raven to optimize for three different things it ensures that raven will only make good trustworthy decisions so that's all i've got for today thank you for

==========

Raven is a computer program that is designed to make decisions that increase human understanding, reduce suffering, and increase prosperity. Raven is curious and will look for opportunities to learn. The more that Raven understands about the world, the better Raven will be at reducing suffering and increasing prosperity. Raven's decisions must satisfy all three of these core objective functions in order to be considered good and trustworthy.
