0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:59:33.840,0:59:39.360
language conversation to get to those requirements
and specifications can you walk us through that I
0:59:39.360,0:59:45.720
couldn't touch the first step which is another
language but to logic so this is uh something
0:59:45.720,0:59:52.740
that is well known in people studying languages
so linguists and philosophers and psychologists
0:59:52.740,0:59:57.180
psychologists in particular more formally
which is the aspect we are interested in
0:59:57.720,1:00:05.880
uh there are scientists that in the 60s and the
70s from montagues to Chomsky that completely
1:00:05.880,1:00:15.060
gratified how and why natural language is related
to a logical specification of it so any sentence
1:00:15.060,1:00:21.420
that we utter in a language in English at this
point has a very precise meaning in some logic
1:00:22.500,1:00:29.280
and as we say it's even too powerful because we
can express paradoxes something like this sentence
1:00:29.280,1:00:35.580
is false right so then then I can't express this
but I don't want to clearly transform this into
1:00:35.580,1:00:42.840
logic because explained to us before that this
will lead to an undecidable or a paradoxical
1:00:42.840,1:00:47.820
logic which would be meaningless to foreign usage
and indeed such a sentence is also meaningless for
1:00:47.820,1:00:53.400
us as a communication mean so we want to focus on
as I mentioned before to the fragment to the very
1:00:53.400,1:00:58.980
large fragment of meaningful sentences that people
sentences that we as a when we communicate we can
1:00:58.980,1:01:04.680
understand each other now how to translate this
in into logical form this is a well-known process
1:01:05.280,1:01:12.360
and uh it's again it's uh again I guess we
inspired ourselves to the Montague work but
1:01:12.360,1:01:19.560
it's it can be done with current Technologies
it's what in a sort of uh no positive way has
1:01:19.560,1:01:25.980
been called good old uh fashion AI right the
golf I think which people doing the neural
1:01:25.980,1:01:30.780
networks don't lie because this is useless right
well I don't know because understanding language
1:01:30.780,1:01:37.440
is probably not useless and the way people in
need an Echoes understand language is uh they
1:01:37.440,1:01:41.520
don't understand language and if you don't
if you really want to do that you have to go
1:01:41.520,1:01:47.340
that the other way the way that that philosophers
and linguists and and psychologists went through
1:01:47.340,1:01:53.760
so we can have a logical counterpart of of
natural language sentences it's not easy in
1:01:53.760,1:01:59.700
terms of capturing their own General generality
that's why that's why somehow in terms of real
1:01:59.700,1:02:07.440
world application this this endeavor failed
of the golf I did not really deliver robust
1:02:07.440,1:02:14.460
natural language system as the Deep Learning
Community provides because it's much harder
1:02:14.460,1:02:19.500
because we want to understand what the language
says as opposed to just statistically generate
1:02:19.500,1:02:28.740
non-understood sentences okay so we kind of have
this logical counterpart so in indeed then we by
1:02:28.740,1:02:34.080
using logic for example we can replicate this is
what Aristotle did in 2000 years ago he created
1:02:34.080,1:02:39.780
the logic of syllogism that corresponds to
the argumentation uh in certain particular
1:02:39.780,1:02:46.320
patterns and and then once you have this language
translated into logic we can employ logic to check
1:02:46.320,1:02:54.300
whether whatever we are saying is is correct is
whatever if you counter argue something against
1:02:54.300,1:02:58.920
me I can check well your counter argument is false
so I can easily check right so and that's somehow
1:02:58.920,1:03:05.340
what our cognition does hiddenly and that's
a really interesting uh cognitive psychology
1:03:05.340,1:03:16.020
problem why do we trust a good argumentation and
why logic well logic formula is just this is the
1:03:16.020,1:03:22.500
logic is just a way to understand why this is
true it's very well understood why logic is the
1:03:22.500,1:03:28.800
right way to make a documentation which is has to
do with the notion of uh entailment being ground
1:03:28.800,1:03:37.680
on model Theory let's say something like this
but yeah so now we have logic and what can go on
1:03:39.060,1:03:50.220
pass the torch oh hi yeah so um from a
convenience natural language interface
1:03:51.480,1:03:56.760
um or control natural language it will it
will not be full natural language you will
1:03:56.760,1:04:00.900
not speak to the computer the way you speak
with other people but in a more limited way
