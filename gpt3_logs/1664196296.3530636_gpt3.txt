The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: is that um is that one it's post-scarcity and so just by existing you have an account that is constantly accumulating cryptocurrencies from all over the world and it's all paid for by basically syntax um uh or or what was it Indulgence tax I think is what it was called um anyways sorry got an itchy spot on my back um and uh but but also so every transaction is a crypt is a public Ledger cryptocurrency transaction in this world um which means that if you buy something that is that is bad for the environment or bad for your health you pay additional tax on it and that tax is immediately distributed to everyone else in the world with no middleman um so that is one possible implementation of a dowel but then you need a currency built in with that also the political system in this novel liquid Reign is that it is 100 distributed in that as long as you are a person on that Network so you're you're gaining currency but you also have votes that you can delegate to other people and you can vote on issues and that is exactly what the Tau system I actually wonder if liquid rain was inspired by this paper anyways the Tau system allows you to participate in all discussions and contribute to all issues and then over time for every individual issue or topic you build consensus and then you can also depending on how you have voted and all of your contributions you can integrate that with artificial intelligence and you can have an agent that will automatically vote for you or automatically eventually automatically propose things for you and so what you're basically doing is creating a a distributed network of generative adversarial networks that are all negotiating with each other on the behalf of people in order to come up with the best decisions that affect everyone such as things about like um you know law making environment uh you know public policy social policy that sort of thing um again super aspirational but uh these folks have reached out to me and I was I've got about halfway through their white paper um there's a few things that seem a little bit vague and hand wavy but having explored this idea through the through the lens of of that work of fiction that I told you about um and also looking at other things such as you know the D the decentralization of um of artificial intelligence I think that these folks are really on to something I don't know if they're going to be the ones to crack it but certainly we're at a phase where everyone is working towards this direction um so yeah I definitely recommend you check out petals and towel I'll be talking with the folks from Tao a little bit later so um we'll see if uh see what comes of that um and then finally open AI is they uh they posted on Twitter and again folks from Discord hopefully uh pointed this out um sure yes okay um they are working on creating basically a new version of of system of experts or an expert system so if you're not familiar um what the the idea was in the 80s that AI would be solved by having experts program all the rules and laws of their domain of expertise into a symbolic engine and that didn't go anywhere it didn't work uh because what they found was that there was Always Something There are there were exceptions and nuances that you just could not hard code with formal logic so openai is revisiting this idea because now we don't have to use formal logic we can use language models and so what they want is they want experts in biology chemistry computer science economics engineering law et cetera Etc and they want to design they want these people what it looks like to me is to design fine-tuning data sets of of asking the right questions and generating the right answers to those questions I don't know if this is going to work I don't think I personally don't think that a a handcrafted fine-tuning data set is the correct approach um personally I think that um that that doing a more generative adversarial Network where you have kind of a peer review process um is going to be far superior but maybe they're doing this just to just to bootstrap it who knows it's kind of a black box open AI as uh is they do produce very good work but they're very cagey until they reduce they produce that work um so who knows maybe they're trying to bootstrap a system of experts or an ensemble of experts in order to have a kind of an automated peer review system um someone actually yesterday alone I think two or three different people messaged me directly about having um having different models or different fine-tuned models like basically debate or contribute in order to do something better so there is a again this is also a decentralized idea which that's the theme of the day right is is decentralized um and so we'll see if that works I apologize if I've been all over the place I hope that uh I hope that you've gotten some value out of this um but yeah so this is a very exciting time I miss one day and all this exciting stuff happens so teach me for taking a day off anyways thanks for watching um sit tight stay tuned and we'll talk again soon

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In his video, David Shapiro talks about some of the exciting things happening in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). He starts by discussing a novel called "Liquid Reign" which features a post-scarcity society in which everyone has a cryptocurrency account that is constantly accumulating value from all over the world. This is made possible by a tax on "bad" behavior, which is immediately distributed to everyone else in the world.

Shapiro then goes on to discuss the Tau system, which is a decentralized system for making decisions that affect everyone. This system is based on artificial intelligence and allows people to participate in discussions and contribute to issues. Over time, this system will automatically vote for or propose things on behalf of the people.

Finally, Shapiro talks about a project from Open AI, which is working on creating a new version of an expert system. This system will be based on language models and will allow experts in various fields to contribute to the data set. It remains to be seen whether or not this system will be successful, but it is an exciting development nonetheless.
