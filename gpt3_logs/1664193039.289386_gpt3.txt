TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody David Shapiro here with some more Auto Muse work um so today we are going to focus on um generative adversarial Networks um specifically for generating uh synopsis um because that's where a story starts you need something to go off of um and so this the the synopsis is the kernel it is the seed of a story it is a premise it is a story premise or a set of ideas that can be expanded upon whether or not you're plotting or pantsing you still need an idea to start from and so this is where all uh generative fiction artificially Intel AI fiction is going to start is with some kind of premise so what I'm doing is I'm um I'm crippling this um this synopsis that's supposed to be grade one so what I'm doing is I'm removing all names from it because one thing that I noticed um that gpt3 does is uh sometimes when it generates garbage it has no names so so I'm just going to actually do this and find and replace all instances of Kwanzaa with nothing and so that way it has an example of what is it what is an actual garbage um uh uh synopsis there we go word sorry about that um all right so then what we're going to do is we're going to find and replace any cases of too many spaces and we'll just replace it with one there we go okay so in this case um we're going to also remove uh because one thing that I found that it does is um The Vicious fighter um finally defeats the fighter is it will give you very generic boilerplate stuff so the whole reason is this is now worse because like yes it's a story but there's no names um oh here let's take out an aging master so we'll just say um yeah there we go cool so now we've got this kind of General generic boilerplate story that has no names no locations um so this is this is a grade one it is a garbage and then we have this other one that is long it's got specific years and locations um it's got names um oh we need to remove end because I don't like it when that when it puts that in there okay and then we've got another we've got a middle of the road one which does have names and places and it's got you know it's it's good but what we really are looking for is something that is solid and so to give a little bit of background I mentioned generative adversarial networks so what I was working on was a um a uh a function here in the generate synopsis so first I've got the generate many which this is this is what I showed before which is if you just want to spam out and generate a whole bunch of data here you go this is how to do it but what I'm going to do is do um def uh let's see we'll do um synopsis Gan um and then I think we probably don't need any variables to go in with that so first we will I think we need to separate out the variables because we want to generate multiple synopsis with the same variables so here we'll do um def uh let's see pick variables and so then we'll do we'll separate this out and this is yeah so we'll copy this up here pick random variables and then we will just return genre tone character paste storyline uh style setting and time period okay so then we'll say these equal pick variables okay so now we've separated out the variables so we can copy this and just bring and just grab it once for when we do for when we do the Gan so we're going to pick we're going to pick all of our variables so that we can we can do it uh multiple times and then we'll say while true um so that we'll get caught in an infinite Loop and basically what we're going to be looking for is we're going to continue generating um synopsis until we get a rank 5 synopsis um okay so with that said um we will do actually generate synopsis we should have rather than pick the variables we should just accept them here and then when we need them foreign we will do it this way there you go that's more appropriate so you're you're going to ask it to generate a synopsis with a given set of variables um there you go print the terms probably don't yeah that's fine we can keep that there um yes okay and so that does a little bit of cleanup and then we let's see what's the temperature the temperature is at 1.1 so you want you want to generate Fiction with a high temperature because you'll get a lot more variation that way now part of the problem though is that you you get higher variation so sometimes it'll generate a short garbage synopsis sometimes it'll generate a long one sometimes it'll just write the story so you want you want to kind of hone in on the the what you want exactly okay so while true um synopsis equals or let's see we'll say um oh yeah so we'll say synopsis equals generate synopsis so we'll just copy this um all right so we'll get a synopsis but then we also want to rank the synopsis so let's split this out as a def as a um as its own uh function So Def and we'll say um grade synopsis so then we'll say pass me the synopsis and synopsis is one of those words that when you say it too many times it feels like it loses all meaning also the camera looks like it's pointing up that looks a little bit better okay um all right so the first thing we do is prompt equals open file um and it's called prompt grade dot text and then synopsis is the story okay so we'll do dot replace story with the synopsis and then we'll do um grade equals gpt3 completion prompt and in this case we actually want to change the temp to zero because then you want it to be deterministic in terms of um what it spits out and this reliably um this reliably generates just a uh where am I going um reliably generates just you know the the grade um okay so then we'll say uh let's see while true synopsis um oh yeah so that's fine and then we'll return the grade so the grade should be a string um like uh let's see whoops one or three or whatever okay so then we'll say grade equals grade synopsis and we'll pass it the synopsis that it just generated so what we're doing is we're only we're generating the variables once right and then we will we will generate um the synopsis oh we should

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

This morning, David Shapiro is focusing on generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically for generating synopsis. He explains that a synopsis is the kernel of a story - the seed of a story, the premise, or a set of ideas that can be expanded upon. Whether or not you're plotting or pantsing, you still need an idea to start from.

Shapiro demonstrates how to generate a garbage synopsis by removing all names from it. He then shows how to generate a middle-of-the-road synopsis with names and places, and finally a solid synopsis. He explains that the goal is to generate a rank 5 synopsis.

To do this, Shapiro first creates a function to pick random variables. He then uses this function to generate a synopsis with a given set of variables. He also creates a function to grade the synopsis. This function uses the GPT3 completion prompt with a temperature of zero to generate a grade for the synopsis.

Shapiro then loops through these functions to generate multiple rank 5 synopsis.
