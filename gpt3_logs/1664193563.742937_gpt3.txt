TRANSCRIPT: whatever and so we can go hunt them down right that is the tyranny of the majority which is absolutely a possibility with something like Dao especially if it's a global Dow that you can't choose whether or not you participate in it um now that being said as a thought experiment if you do have a global Dow and we all work we all come to consensus that say yes some people should be able to opt out that's an that's entirely possible but once your data is in a blockchain it's possible to remove right and so one thing that I think and this is I guess would be open to consensus one thing that I think is that all data should be anonymized so where you say like okay like someone with a uuid right or you know maybe every conversation is just given its own unique identifier but no other identifying information so it's like okay you know someone at you know timestamp X in Block y you know with uidz said this and other than that like that representation is completely autonomous so there is a technology and this is actually I know about this from from the Discord server um one of the technologies that could enable this for security is what's called fully homomorphic encryption um and I had to look it up because I had an idea what it was so fully homomorphic encryption means that you can have encrypted data and they can work on that data and get the same result um whether or not that data is encrypted or decrypted and so what that allow is that your your data stays encrypted in such a way that nobody else ever sees it but the LM or the the AI can work with it and generate a result whether or not you see it so then um AI research lab says that's how I handle my consumer apps I think that you're probably responding to keeping data encrypted at all times or maybe it's encrypted locally on your on your users devices something like that um so that's another possibility so at the beginning of this of this podcast episode at this live stream I was talking about how models are getting smaller and faster so one possibility is that your data never leaves your device right um or you know never leaves your uh oh Anonymous session IDs yes okay yeah um I'm a big fan of an anonymous session IDs as long as long as the session is validated it was a real human saying the thing because you might also one one problem one downside with Anonymous session IDs is that you could have a bot you know uh bot attack um that says like hey um you know we're gonna spin up a million and a half Bots that are all going to advocate for you know like abortion bans or something or maybe you know yeah denial of service or distributed denial of service attack basically against the towel so you have to you have to balance like okay can you can if if you anonymize everyone's opinions can you still verify that a real human saying it so that's a that's a big problem um uh in order to in order to do this which this is one reason why you know like uh Democratic voting I still think is like because you go there's a there's a physical location you physically you know show up um you know there's the you there's a human that interacts with you and it says okay I'm interacting with a human and a human hands you your voter you know your voter sheet and then you feed it into a machine and there's a physical copy right um you can't do that with robots yet you can't do that with a with a botnet yet however if we move to a uh to a fully digital Dow um you could have a botnet kind of adversarially attack and try and get policy changes um so that's a huge huge risk um but yeah okay so I went through many tangents there um I'm gonna try and remind myself where I was going with all that um but those were some good questions this always happens where like usually by the end there's some really good conversations happening um let's see so Anonymous session IDs distributed or a denial of service attacks yeah so well we've only got about five minutes left any fine questions before we wrap it up for the night God this this hour has flown by it feels like 20 minutes for me um but yeah we'll uh I'll wait for just a second then we'll wrap up for the evening two two two two but yeah okay I guess I'll I'll respond to um little ape skate club's last comment about like our current AI works the new camera right so every time throughout all of history every time art Has Changed by a technology there have been people who fought it right um even novels right we take we take for granted that the novel today is a um is is a work of art but when novels first came out there was a whole bunch of people who were so mad because they thought that that books should just be academic and should just be enriching you know like they should just be used for religion and Science and government and that's it and that it was like sacrilegious to have you know tripe you know like erotic fiction or any fiction whatsoever in the written word and you know like okay today we're like no like the novel is an art form and I'm a novelist right that's what I do that's one of my my side my side projects is is you know uh as I write and it is absolutely a form of Art so what about you know fast forward to cameras right where instead of having to master watercolor and paints and brushes and Engravings you just have a device and you go click like that's loafer right but you look at how people like yes there are disposable cameras you can go to the store and get you know a 10 disposable camera take pictures everyone carries around an HD camera in their pockets all day um but you know nobody's complaining about that right like just because you have a camera in your pocket doesn't mean you're a good photographer right you take one or two like photography classes you will improve your your quality of photographer um several times like I took a photography class back in high school and it still shows right so just because the tools change doesn't mean that it's not a new form of art um but it also just because

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In recent years, models of artificial intelligence (AI) have become smaller and faster. One possibility for the future is that data will never leave an individual's device, or that it will be anonymized. However, this raises the concern of botnets adversarially attacking and manipulating data in order to change policy.
