The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: kind of drug okay python generate data and hey look at that completion mesothelioma that was fast chief complaint i need refills why are you going so slow so while that's running we can also check our logs whoa hold on it is doing stuff but it's not showing me what's going on the following is a patient chart whether diagnosis was given what is the diagnosis am i grabbing the wrong prompts it kind of looks like i am yeah because this is this is jumping ahead hmm i have done something wrong this always happens the prompt is open the file name hang on we're going to need to open a few of these let's open a few in sequence because it should be one after the other okay so this one is dot 234.99 let's see two two three four four dot nine okay so these two are one right after the other was a die why isn't this working i have done something seriously wrong it's like it's [Music] let's do a little bit more let's see print we're going to say we're going to print out the medical file so that we can see that and then we're going to print out the boolean and so then we will do yeah we're also going to print out the um the file name oh that's what's happening i changed the file name and it's not re-initialized damn it okay so what we need to do is do new file name i bet that's what it was so then we'll say file name yeah because if you change it then it's only going to do the wrong one every time yeah don't mess with don't mess with your important variables when in the loop okay i think i fixed it i think it's good now python generate data yes yes yes yes these are all positives intramuscular lipoma epididym [Music] hey if it's all yes that's fine you know i would like to see some that have no but given the fact that these are medical records there's probably gonna be well child check malnutrition diagnosis yes okay this is running so rather than watch all the data go i'll go ahead and pause the video and we'll explore the data once it's done um let me just show you while it's running in the background so we've got um for file name and bools so we've got um we've got four different prompts and we're going to do each one 50 times and then so we do a seed and then we do a random choice so i've got up here import random seed and choice so out of those 3 000 contacts we're just going to pick a random one every time so that's better than doing shuffle or whatever so we're going to get 50 choices this is also good because you don't want to ask the same question against like the same four questions against one medical text you wanna you wanna show different pro or different contexts with different questions because that forces gpt three to think a little bit harder so that means we'll have 200 different different samples to pull from and then we'll look at the final data once it's done and uh yeah so like i said we're almost there sit tight i've made a critical mistake i broke one of my own rules which is you're supposed to save your work as you go and this is why it got to the very end error name json is not defined it's fine it's fine okay so let's fix this real quick and then we'll run it again import json and then what we want to do is regardless of what the what the result is we want to save it so we will um how should we name this we'll probably just do um let's see out file name equals let's see how do i usually do it um we'll just say completion underscore that dot um now we'll say json l just json that's fine and then we'll do time and then we will do with open and then we'll say um i'll just say data slash that out file name because if i got to this point and it blew up i could have just merged it all together but let's fix it let's do it right save your data as you go actually i suppose you know what i do have it saved i've got it all saved in the gpt3 logs um but rather than clean all this stuff up um let's just do it the right way let's just do it the right way write and that should be enough as out file json.dump info to outfile that should be good okay this was self-inflicted 100 self-inflicted let's run this again and watching it run it worked beautifully oh wait wait wait wait wait yeah i need a data file or folder yep it probably said not found or maybe i cancelled it before okay so it should be saving yeah look at that so list all diagnosis completion laparoscopic cholestectomy okay so we're saving all the data there it's kind of funny that um i haven't used notepad plus plus always for json um completion left plural effusion okay last time i swear you can see it working the data is here it's accumulating we've got 17 out of 200 done so all right pausing the video one last time and then i guess we have to do the fine tuning test and we're done uh we are done with not the whole thing but most of it so let me show you we now have 199 samples out here um some of them say like none found um let's see list all tests the patient will go home with vicodin for pain and follow up postoperatively in the office where we will review the path report with her that is a great output look at that so that's not necessarily a test though so okay that's basically a follow-up this is another good reason that i should have followed my own rules which is just accumulate the data separately because then you can go through and manually fix these so i'm not going to worry about that this time but also what you can do is if you accumulate the data like this you can run it multiple times and so because this is just 200 samples but what if you want like 10 000 samples to train on that'll be better um so yeah so now i've got a separate function or a script just to format the data so we'll do python format and that should create a little guy here called medical.jsonl why is it all in quotes that's not right man i'm having a rough day of it trying something new like i said playing with real world data is a whole different animal um oh i think i know what i did right because i didn't read it i just read it as a string so

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I made a mistake that broke one of my own rules: always save your work as you go. As a result, I got to the very end and got an error.

I was trying to generate data using Python, and I wanted to pull randomly from a list of 3,000 contacts. I was only going to get 50 choices, and I wanted to show different pro or different contexts with different questions because that would force gpt three to think a little bit harder.

However, I accidentally changed the file name and didn't re-initialize it. This led to the error "name 'json' is not defined."

I fixed the mistake and re-ran the code. This time, it worked beautifully. The data was accumulating, and I had 199 samples.

Some of them said "none found," but many of them were great outputs, like "the patient will go home with vicodin for pain and follow up postoperatively in the office where we will review the path report with her."

Now that I have a separate function or script to format the data, I can run it multiple times and get even more data. This is important because the more data I have, the better my results will be.
