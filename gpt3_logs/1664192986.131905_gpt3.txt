TRANSCRIPT: and then this one okay so we only summarize the previous chunk yeah because we'll want a summary of this and we'll concatenate it with this guy and then we'll generate the next chunk okay right got it i think so so we only summarize this so next chunk equals summarize the original so the summary is previous guy okay so now we have the summary and the next chunk so what we want to do is summary happens last and that's going to be the same but in this case the next chunk is going to be the summary plus whatever the next chunk was in the previous time next chunk and at some point we also have to save this right because the yeah the summary and so yeah okay i think i'm on to it get everything started and this is just because we're using genesis instead of next chunk because we need to get started we need to instantiate net next chunk and then the summary but really i wonder because this is pretty much identical so i wonder if i just call instead of genesis i wonder what happens if i just call because next chunk is generated from the summary and the previous instance of next chunk so if i just call this next chunk and then i instantiate summary summary equals that so then we start with next chunk so what this would end up is summary is null plus next chunk next paragraph so that generates the next thing oh but then we lose the genesis block so first that means we have to save file we'll do we'll do the file name will be story underscore time dot text and so that'll be time and then the content will be next chunk so that's when we save it we save it at the beginning of every loop right okay and then for this we'll do like four i in um list range zero to twenty not two twenty okay so the at the beginning of everyone we generate so we save a file so we save the chunk then we generate the next chunk and it's always it's always called next chunk because it's it's looping through and then we summarize so we load prompt summary.txt story summary uh we actually want to summer summarize we want to summarize it before yeah because if we take this we say okay so we've got this is this is the previous chunk i need to change the names that's what i need to do previous chunk equals next chunk yeah because we need we need to keep track of these two chunks separately so previous chunk equals next chunk so at the beginning of the loop previous chunk is this original guy then we say so then we save so actually i guess we're saving i guess they're the same at this point so then we have next chunk is this guy is the summary plus so the summary should be of previous chunk or the the next chunk should include it oh this is so confusing here we'll do this like range of two because i'll need to i'll need to look at the output um to make sure that i do this right this is probably so painfully boring i'm gonna pause it while i figure this out okay sorry for that i think i've got it so we'll do python write novel um so the trees stood like sentinels etc etc he's the chosen one destined to save the world so it's gonna run in the background um silas stepped into the forest the leaves crunching under his feet he took a deep breath filling his lungs um silas the chosen one i've come to meet the dragons the door opened and silas stepped into the tower so that's fun um silas stepped into the tower and the door closed behind him with a snap he was in a small windowless room with a single table and chair in the center the wizard said then let us begin the wizard led silas down a long winding staircase into a large underground chamber so this is good okay so we've got five steps here um didn't i count one two three four four steps okay so that was just a good little test so let me show you what went into this so the story is recorded here so we've got the the genesis block which is there plus the output here and then there is just a whoops then there's just a few things going on behind the scenes so let me just grab all of these and we'll do edit so the first thing is it uses the fine tune model to just generate the next next bit and then we say write a concise summary of this so it summarizes the previous bit and then it it adds that summary to the next generation so stepped into the forest and then so then we summarize all of that again and then we generate another story and then we summarize it again so it continuously summarizes everything that has happened up to that point and then adds to the story and so far it looks like it's pretty coherent um so let's delete this um and then i'll let it go for let's say 20 generations and then we'll call it a day because my head hurts um i'll probably do something to just like concatenate it all together but the way that i've got it written right now is that it'll show you as it's generating it um so yeah let's go ahead and just have this run and as long as it can have a coherent consistent store oh whoops crap i meant to change the uh the value no don't keep it here um so we'll go up to 20. so we're going to do 20 generations apologies story and then gbt3 logs okay it did cancel before it did anything okay good oops okay so we're going to do we're going to do 20 we're going to see how long it can keep up the story and keep it coherent one problem is that doing a concise summary so this prompt where it just says write a concise summary of the following um you often lose important details but we'll see hopefully it will it will keep details especially since it's adding as it goes um but yeah so let's kick this off um and then i'll come right back and we'll show you everything kind of brought together at the very end all right pausing now okay so we got stuck in in a loop i noticed this so it says silas set out into the forest on a quest to find the dragons and wizards and you see it's the wizards is in the same place all the way through so you see these patterns all right so why did this pattern happen let's go into gbt3 logs um uh yeah that's fine whoops so let's just close close all

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The story so far: Silas has set out into the forest on a quest to find the dragons and wizards. He has been told that he is the chosen one and that he is destined to save the world. He has been led by the wizard down a long winding staircase into a large underground chamber.

The problem:

It seems that the story has gotten stuck in a loop, with Silas encountering the same wizard in the same location each time. It's not clear why this is happening, but it may be due to the fact that the story is being generated by a computer and is not being edited by a human.
