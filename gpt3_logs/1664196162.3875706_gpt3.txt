The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: yolo models and other models that will that will dump in like a narrative of like this is what i'm seeing right i see a clown running across the street something like that that's going to be relatively fixed however these other services will be learning services so in natural language cognitive architecture there's only two loops right there's the outer loop and the inner loop with with this with artificial cognition with the microservices architecture there are many many loops each one of these microservices has several loops and then of course the nexus microservice it's a it's a rest based service so it's it's not really operating as a loop it's operating uh transactionally but so for instance the core objective functions the first thing that this service will do and the first thing that most services do will it'll look for recent messages from the conductor and i'll tell you what the conductor does in a second but i've done all the experiments that that i needed to to figure out how to build this so now i just need to pull it all together into a microservice so i know that what you're about to hear me say sounds very fantastical i've done all my homework now i'm building it and that's why i'm making this video so the core objective functions the first thing it'll do is it'll look for messages from the conductor what does a conductor do in real life so a conductor of a symphony orchestra tells all the different other services or not services um sections um you know play louder play faster play softer take a break it does it that's what a conductor does is it listens to the whole orchestra the whole piece of music and make sure that all the different pieces are playing together nicely and that is exactly what the conductor does for artificial cognition is the conductor listens to everything going on in the nexus and provides feedback to all these services and those services modify their behavior based on what the conductor says so the conductor is like you know the prefrontal cortex of this of of the artificial cognition it's the organizer of thought um it's the board queen it brings order to chaos and so um the first thing that for instance the core objective function service does is it looks for messages from the conductor the conductor can provide feedback such as slow down speed up or focus on something right because directing attention you don't want services to go like focus on the wrong thing because especially when you have many many services all reacting to each other they need they need guidance as to what to focus on and that's what a conductor does right this is where we are in the piece of music focus on this measure right here so focus on this problem this is this is where our attention lies because the nexus is completely agnostic it doesn't care about what's going on it is just a message broker and in fact i i originally used stuff like amqp a message broker um to to do this but now i'm doing vector database so the conductor focuses on handling attention and i've done all my homework you'll see it in the book you'll see it in upcoming videos um in terms of prioritization and what to focus on so the conductor will be periodically issuing messages this is what we're working on that's called cognitive control so if you have like add or adhd or you're really tired and you can't focus it's because your mental conductor is like let's do that no let's do that let's do this instead it means you're easily distracted so what this conductor will do is it'll say this is what we're focusing on everyone go at this pace let's make sure that we're working in a concerted effort concert concerted effort so that's the first thing that a microservice does is it is it looks for messages from the conductor and modifies its behavior accordingly and then it reads the rest of the messages that have happened recently or older messages depending on what it does because so say for instance um you have a service that's like trying to answer questions or trying to to remember you know the ancient past it might search for older memories right so it'll start by saying okay what is currently going on and so that says like give me the most recent time window and then the service depending again depending on the service it might also use those associative memories to say okay this is what's going on right now now give me everything from ancient history that is related to what's going on right now so this is for instance this is why if you walk into a room you forget why you walked in there because your brain gets a different set of memories it says ah i'm in a new room let me grab the memories from this room um and then it forgets the memories that you had in another room which is where you were when you you know decided to go somewhere else and do a task the same thing happens like you know you go to work and suddenly you remember like oh yeah like you know because it's a different setting it feels different it sounds different it smells different you see different people and so you have this entirely different context and it dredges up different memories that's one reason for instance i'm you know as soon as i finish this video i'm going into the office i my my work productivity changes it's not that i'm more or less productive it's that my brain is in a different context so i do different things when i go into the office it's working differently and so that's what i mean by associative memory so you pull you pull temporal memory you say what's going on right now and then you pull associative memory that says give me everything else that's related to this and then whatever the microservice's purpose is it will then do its work and then contribute some messages back to the nexus so like i said for core objective functions what this does is it can help brainstorm ideas about how to adhere to its principles it can also provide admonishment so for instance if um if you yell at the uh at the your artificial

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In artificial cognition, there are many microservices, each with its own objectives and loops. The core objective function microservice looks for messages from the conductor. The conductor is responsible for directing attention and providing feedback to the services. The service then uses the information from the conductor to modify its behavior. The conductor is like the prefrontal cortex of artificial cognition, organizing thoughts and bringing order to chaos.

The core objective function microservice also reads other messages that have happened recently or older messages, depending on what it needs to do. For instance, a service that is trying to answer questions or remember the past might search for older memories. This is why if you walk into a room and forget why you came in, it's because your brain has gotten a different set of memories associated with the new room.

Once the microservice has the information it needs, it will then do its work and contribute some messages back to the nexus. For instance, the core objective function microservice can help brainstorm ideas or provide admonishment.
