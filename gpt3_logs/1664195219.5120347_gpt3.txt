TRANSCRIPT: and so then um then the answer is like okay let's provide that answer so let's grab um shoulder impingement that's a good that's a good term okay so we'll say uh let's just stash that there oops and then grab this prompt so we'll say okay whoops okay so then we'll just do shoulder impingement and so then we'll ask gpt3 to just give a detailed paragraph of what this is shoulder impingement is a condition in which the shoulder joint does not move as freely as it should etc etc okay clearly it knows what shoulder impingement is so what we've done is we've first said okay based on this based on this medical situation that we had um let's let's look for some relevant information and then finally the third part of this so this is this is called prompt chaining where you have the input from one prompt or the output from one prompt serve as the input to the next prompt so on and so forth um so that's called prompt chaining um and then answer the following internet search queries as a detailed paragraph provide following information and examples um oh and then this one was just like add more information um that i so i added this as a third one because sometimes gpt3 will just give really concise answers so we don't need to do that one here anyways the point being is now you see what a meta prompt is where it's like okay i'm gonna ask you to generate something that i need to do next um and so that is once once we enact cognitive control those first several prompts that i talked about where it's like what am i doing what should i be doing how do i do it right those that's cognitive control then we're going to ask gpt3 to generate the cognitive tasks so that's where we'll get into metaprompting but we're not there yet we got a ways to go okay close that close that close that close that and we're back here okay so that's what i mean by dossier list i'll probably just simplify this to prompt list because everyone's going to know what a prompt is so in fact let's just go ahead and replace dossier with prompt we don't need to invent anything okay so we've got all the prompts listed this will be the second part of the video it might even be the second video because let's see how much how how long are we we're already 30 minutes in and we haven't even gotten started so we'll probably save the the prompt engineering for all the cognitive tasks later okay stack memories so the memories are going to be pulled from the nexus folder which i just created and so it's empty right but basically what this does is uh well first actually let's go through the main list i've given you the background so nexus index equals update nexus index so what this does is it looks for all the memories in here and it uses the gpt3 embedding endpoint to create a vector representation of every memory which allows you to do very easy searches so first thing is let's update our index or mental index that way we know what we know so this variable here the nexus index will hold everything um search index oh yeah and i'll actually have to add that here so first thing we do is whatever happened in the last loop whatever input or output or other loops are participating in the nexus let's update that index so that way we've got it in working memory we know what we know and and we can search it so then the latest just grabs the latest memories that's exactly what it says on the tin all it does is go into the nexus folder it reads the 10 most recent files so look going back to my previous experiment the raven one that'll basically be just like grab the last 10 memories okay that's the most recent stuff that's going to be the most relevant in the future we're going to want to be able to grab the most recent 100 memories 1000 memories million memories right but because gpt3 is limited in its window size i'm limiting it to 10. so it's working memory is very small compared to hours so in the main loop grab the latest memory then we stack the memories so what stacking the memories does is it just puts them all into one text block and it says like three minutes ago four minutes ago five minutes ago um that's all it does um so it just it just formats it into instead of a list of files it formats it into a list of text not a not a not a big deal oldest time um actually i'm not even using this oh yeah actually it's supposed to be used here so basically then what we say is like okay let's search so that your brain does this automatically this is all 100 inspired from neuroscience all the books that i've read um so once once your index is updated it's like okay great now what do we do we get all our latest memories so this is like the most recent stuff that's happened then we search for um we search for those um we've already stacked them um yeah so that's older stuff okay gotcha um so we what we do then is we search so the search index function comes up here and we just say okay take the most recent block of memories as a text pass the nexus index and so for every memory in here and there's going to be faster ways of doing this um there are there are like uh pine cone is a as a vector-based search engine um the work this is all experimental so i can hear some of you people saying this is not the most efficient way of doing it i know this is just for prototyping um ideally the whole search index that'll be its own api service as well as the memory so actually fun fact while we're here let me tell you something to do where did it go um raven so these memories one day will all be stored in a private blockchain so if you ever watch the movie um uh uh blade runner 2049 or whatever it's called um he has a companion that's an ai and her memories of him are private to that device so i'm like oh i bet you that's a private blockchain running on that device at least that's what my brain is filling in the blanks because the re like he says like download yourself into this device that way like when they come and grab you they can't find anything right because if

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Shoulder impingement is a condition in which the shoulder joint does not move as freely as it should. This can be caused by a variety of things, including damage to the rotator cuff, bursitis, or arthritis. Treatment for shoulder impingement typically includes a combination of physical therapy, exercises, and rest. In some cases, surgery may be necessary.
