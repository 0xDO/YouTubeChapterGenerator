The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: microservices architecture and all the reasoning and philosophy behind it as well as um actually you know recording the results the actual demonstration so it's not just going to be you know abstract theory it'll be this is this is what i built this is how it worked this is what didn't work and this is why um so that's symphony of thought um my other book the philosophy one is called post nihilism uh philosophy for the 21st century so the short version of that is that we are in the midst of what i call the nihilistic crisis uh the nihilistic crisis is being driven by four primary um uh phenomena in society uh the first uh is childhood abandonment and that is most uh commonly seen with children that are in my when i was little it was we were abandoned in front of uh tv screens um but today it's video games and tablets and and interactive you know online stuff um but you know childhood emotional neglect i found a study that said that um 20 of adults rep report that they were emotionally neglected as children although this study did say that um that these numbers uh likely under represent the actual truth um so that's childhood abandonment the the second uh driving force of the nihilistic crisis is um is social abandonment which we see in you know all the complaints about like the anti-work movement and people that are feeling left behind because rent is is you know unattainable buying a house is unattainable good jobs are unattainable so those are all symptoms of social abandonment where we're not looking out for each other anymore the third driver of the nihilistic crisis is uh is cosmic abandonment which was caused or symptomatic of the rise of secularism and so i'm not saying you know like oh well we all just need to go back to church no what i'm saying is that is that old paradigms of spirituality are not working for us anymore and so we need a new paradigm of spirituality hence all the books on spirituality that i've read so i've got some ideas about how to reform our approach to spirituality which will help alleviate that third abandonment the cosmic abandonment and finally the last phase of the nihilistic crisis is self-abandonment and self-abandonment comes when you give up hope right it is um it is the my the quagmire of hopelessness and despair and we see this it is most symptomatic it is most worse when you see particularly teenagers becoming school shooters and it's that is a that is a crisis of of hopelessness of i'm in pain and i don't see any relief so i'm just going to share my pain um from a philosophical perspective from a cultural perspective and i know this is an oversimplification right there are many reasons that mass shootings happen and it's not just teenagers who commit them um but in general um from a philosophical perspective that's kind of what i think is going on and that is only one symptom that is the most egregious symptom but there are other symptoms of of self-abandonment so for instance deaths from despair are on the rise which is things like drug overdoses alcoholism and suicide are all on the rise and part of that is self-abandonment where someone gives up hope and they don't see any purpose to their life and so that is the nihilistic crisis and that is uh that is the book that i'm uh or post nihilism is the book that i'm writing to that proposes how do we move past this phil on a philosophical and spiritual and intellectual level but also post nihilism is the under underpinning philosophy behind my design of artificial cognition and specifically the core objective functions which i now call the heuristic imperatives which is once again reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding um i might be wrong but uh it makes sense to me and people that i talk to about it say it makes sense i mean one of my best friends is a uh is a philosopher turned physicist and she's like yeah i am proudly a post nihilist when we talked about it so maybe i'm onto something not everyone's gonna get it that's fine um but yeah so this video ended up being longer than i wanted it to be i just wanted to give an update as to what i'm working on and why and so i've got six books that i'm working on i'm gonna get as many of them done as i can and then i'll be back to presenting on youtube more regularly obviously showing you the books that i'm writing that's really boring so anyways thanks for watching take care like and subscribe etc etc

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I'm working on a book called Symphony of Thought, which is about the microservices architecture. I'm also writing a book called Post Nihilism, which is about the philosophy behind this architecture. I'm recording the results of my work so far, so that people can see that it's not just theory, but that it actually works.

The Post Nihilism book is about the nihilistic crisis that we are currently facing. This crisis is being driven by four primary factors: childhood abandonment, social abandonment, cosmic abandonment, and self-abandonment. I believe that if we can address these factors, we can alleviate the nihilistic crisis.

Self-abandonment is the most egregious symptom of the nihilistic crisis, and is most evident in mass shootings. However, there are other symptoms of self-abandonment, such as deaths from despair (drug overdoses, alcoholism, suicide, etc.). I believe that if we can address the root causes of self-abandonment, we can reduce the incidence of these symptoms.

I'm working on six books in total, and my goal is to get as many of them done as possible. I hope that my work will help people to understand the nihilistic crisis and how to address it. Thanks for watching!
