The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you know educate research ask questions whatever but we also want our artificial cognitive entity to be curious because it should if it's just intrinsically trying to increase understanding for other other beings other than itself that doesn't help it learn it might learn passively or accidentally but we don't want to leave curiosity up to chance we want it to actually we want curiosity to be a deliberate function of our intelligent entity and so here we have these are great questions so these are questions that it could ask internally what is the cause of earth's heating is it actually co2 what are the consequences of the heat indexes that's a fantastic question how are the forests and coral reefs dying what are the effects of crop failures what is causing local wars what is the extent of human and animal suffering these are phenomenal questions that we would want our artificial cognitive entity to be asking itself and others in this situation so by having this imperative service that just all it does is it observes what's going on and it puts this information these ideas and questions back into the nexus which are then going to be used by other services such as the action discernment and other services i think that's about it i think you're caught up to speed with how this works and so what this does is all these prompts that i just showed you and demonstrated um what this does is it grabs that and um it grabs the information from the nexus does all of those um those prompts that i just showed you and then sends it back i do have other fine tuning experiments out there already for generating questions as well as the other core objective functions or heuristic imperatives that's actually available core objective functions here um so i've got plenty of experiments um on modeling these with fine tuning so eventually once i get all these baseline microservices up and running i'll incorporate the fine-tune models and another advantage of the fine-tune models is that as the as the as raven or artificial cognitive entities gain more experiences they will have more knowledge more data to chew on and more ideas in terms of how to implement their imperatives and they'll also get more consistent over time meaning since their heuristic imperatives the heuristic aspect is they will learn morality they will learn um what is uh how how best to how best to behave um over time so i think that's about it um let me just go back and show you uh one last thing um repositories so these are all come on these are all public so the nexus which is the the central service this is public it's ready to go the simulation service is up and running the imperative service i just finished it i tested it in pieces um i need to actually set everything in motion and and let it run um and then the embedding service um which is which has been up and running um so this this is uh the universal sentence encoder service that allows all the memories to be searchable so there you have it this is a research update for my artificial cognition research thanks for watching um like and subscribe if you would please and then also consider supporting me on patreon link is in the description thanks for watching and have a good day

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I want to update you on my progress with artificial cognition research. I have been working on a few different aspects of this research, including a service that I call the "Imperative Service." This service is designed to generate questions for our artificial cognitive entity to ask, in order to increase its understanding.

I have been testing the Imperative Service in pieces, and it is now up and running. I have also been working on a "Simulation Service" which is up and running, and an "Embedding Service" which allows memories to be searchable. All of these services are public and available for use.

In the future, I plan to incorporate "fine-tuning models" into these services, which will allow the artificial cognitive entity to learn and improve its morality over time. Thanks for watching, and please consider supporting me on Patreon.
