The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: are sitting in a ch at a stone chest table they're playing chess um so you see where it's like they're actually not playing chess anymore so i didn't need to do a little bit of testing um but here it says um you know one becomes frustrated knocks over the other man remains calm so it made that inference um one of them actually looks like it's repeating itself um so i will probably change the summary so instead of detailed summary we'll say concise summary since every previous world state is saved we don't need we don't need to have the whole thing so we'll just do concise summary so that'll keep it that'll keep it from ballooning because you'll see what happens as we go so event so this is the new event right so this is the new world state so it says the two men get into a heated argument and start to yell at each other that's a likely next step if you know you're having a game of chess and someone rage quits you might get upset um so the the the new the state change um the two men are still sitting at the stone table but they are no longer playing chess see it has updated the world state and as you're reading this you can follow along now another thing that can happen is that you could also use this for planning video games you could use this to write fiction it's just a matter of does it have enough information background information to keep things going if you summarize the world state fully enough or have a way of recall which we'll talk about recall in another video um so anyways so you know one of the men has knocked over the chessboard etc etc um so they're doing this here's the new state it's getting longer and longer um event the two men continue to argue and start to physically fight so you see here the event is much longer um but it's it's also very very repetitive [Music] so we need to maybe do some prompt engineering on the event because the event is supposed to be one or two sentences total so let's take a look at the event prompt this is a text based simulation giving the following world state imagine a likely or random event describe the event in one or two sentences okay that should work okay whatever um if we one thing when you have prompt chaining like this or prompt stacking you can get really interesting effects compounding effects um so i'm only going to change one thing at a time i changed it from from detailed summary to concise summary that might be enough to prevent it from snowballing because you see that's what's happening here is it's snowballing it's everything is getting longer and longer and longer now so this is a hilarious state change the two men are still fighting the man who was losing the fight is now lying on the ground unconscious the sun is still shining and the birds are still singing etc etc okay so let's take a look at what the last world state was um okay so there we go the two men are now arguing with each other and yelling so let's go ahead and we made one change so let's do a clear screen and let's let the simulation run it's going slow right now i'm not sure if it's something i've done in my code or if gpt3 is just running slow right now event the two men continue to argue and eventually get into a physical altercation they start to push and shove each other etc etc all right the state changed the two men are still sitting at the stone chest table they're no longer playing chess and they're now fighting they're both bleeding and their clothes are ripped that's fun um it's interesting it still says they're sitting at a stone chest table but they're not the two men are arrested by the police two men are sitting in a jail cell they're both bleeding and their clothes are ripped um let's see have black eyes and bruises are taken to the hospital for their injuries nice um they're going to jail um let's see it looks like it's a little bit kind of stuck on repeat so the concise thing might have oh the two men are released from jail after posting bail oh that's great the story advances um let's see they posted bail again find in order to stay away from each other there we go okay so it looks like the the concise summary is confusing and it's getting stuck on repeat oh they filed a restraining order this the plot advances again this is great um okay so um the event is fine it seems like it seems like the concise summary is is removing too much information um so what it happens if we just do summary so detailed summary is like long summary and concise summary is short summary so what if we just do like summary all right and so also remember it picks up where it left off so the last world state the men are arrested for disorderly conduct for after getting into a fist fight they have black eyes the men are released from jail they're both fine in order to stay away from each other so that's where the story left off so let's continue the story okay we already know that there it seems like it seems like we lost too much information if they get into another fist fight okay and now it looks like it's being very repetitive okay i think i think the problem i think i i think i created more problems than i solved when i removed the detailed summary um detailed summary because when you lose that context that's i think that's what's making it get stuck on repeat um uh but we need it to be less repetitive um [Music] and we need it we need each phase to be less repetitive um i wonder if we can uh we can just say like rewrite like have a have a another prompt that says that it's just kind of a generic like rewrite the following to be less repetitive um if there are any repetitions um let me try that real quick let me go back uh see what's the longest one here we go all right so then we'll go to playground what is that um let's see rewrite the following passage to remove repetitiveness is that how you spell that um passage um remove repetition um move repetitiveness whoops um if present yeah because it says like children are still running and playing um in the

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In a chat, two men are sitting at a stone chest table playing chess. However, they are no longer playing chess and one of the men is knocked over. The summary is now concise and it is clear that the two men are no longer playing chess. The event is longer, but it is repetitive. The two men continue to argue and start to physically fight. The state changes and the two men are still sitting at the stone table, but they are no longer playing chess and they are now fighting. The two men are arrested by the police and taken to the hospital for their injuries. They are released from jail after posting bail. The men file a restraining order in order to stay away from each other.
