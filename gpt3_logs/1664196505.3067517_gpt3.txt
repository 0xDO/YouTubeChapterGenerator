The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: between the instructions it's like it goes in knowing this is what i'm supposed to do and then you remind it of its instructions at the end and it usually gives you pretty good results um okay so then we we load up the prompt we put in the text block we get the response and then we print the response so let's just show you let's make this a little bit bigger because i know you're watching on a a youtube video okay so we'll just run this it'll take just a second to run and then basically we'll be summarizing 25 reviews okay but you're like that's 25 reviews out of 14 000. so what do you do with that okay so strengths great price lightweight and portable screen is great expandable memory um it's durable weaknesses slow some apps not compatible parental controls could be better okay great that's that's really that's that's a good summary um so we took you know four thousand to eleven thousand characters and summarized it so then we run it again so this is what an audit is is you you you randomly select samples and then you'd kind of uh you you look at it multiple times so then you say okay people love the affordability versatility and ease of use of the fire tablet okay so we see affordability so that's repeated so that's consistent versatility so this is this is a little bit different maybe this is what they mean by you know lightweight and portable or expandable memory um and then ease of use right however some people found that the tablet is breakable so this is also in contrast with the the uh durability does not support connectivity to a 5g network so there's limitations so we're seeing that okay we don't have a full picture obviously like if you if you get just 25 reviews out of 14 000 you're not going to get the whole picture but you don't need to read all 14 000 reviews so what we're going to do is run this a couple more times and i'll show you that this is what you do in an audit you keep collecting samples until you see the pattern repeat key strengths of this product are its clear picture nice size screen and good price so we're seeing price price price price um key weaknesses are its average battery life and charging ports okay so run it again and so this will be four times key strengths are those great for kids it is very affordable and has lots of features key weaknesses is that the app store is a little limited and the micro usb portion gets loose so that's probably the charging port this could all the pattern is also emerging maybe the thing that breaks is the usb ports um okay so that's after just four iterations so what we're going to do now is we're going to automate the audit process and so what i'll do is i'll take this so we'll say let's see summaries equals list and then we'll say for i in range let's see we got to do list list range 0 um to 10. um actually that might give us 11. that's fine it doesn't matter um okay so we'll basically just repeat this so we'll say subset so we'll just grab a random subset out of those 14 000 reviews we'll grab 25 of them we'll we'll smoosh it into a block of text because you know gpt3 doesn't understand python lists but it does understand text then we'll feed it in and we'll get the response and then we'll say summaries dot append response okay but then what are we going to do okay we have all these responses together what's the big deal so let me tell you what the big deal is we will oh and actually let me add that so that way each each one has its own little dash at the beginning so then what we're going to do is we're going to take all those summaries and we're going to do it one last time because in the prompt we say detailed summary detail detailed we want we want to know all the details so we'll keep we'll use the same exact prompt and so this is like a meta-summary um and we'll say uh here we'll just copy copy some of the stuff that works text block equals join but instead of subset we're going to do we're going to join summaries and then we will do the same thing so we'll get one final meta summary at the very end and [Music] let's do we'll do a couple of dashes new line new line and then new line new line so that way it'll just kind of separate it all out okay so let's run this and basically what we'll see is we'll see it do 10 or 11 i can't remember the exact logic if it includes or excludes the last number i don't remember that's fine either way point being is we should get enough to see some patterns emerging um and then there's all kinds of other stuff we can do with these right we can change this prompt to uh you know to say like not just what they love and hate but just what are they saying about it um and then we can also ask we could ask gpt3 to infer recommended changes to the product right actually that's not a bad idea let's go ahead and do that so rather than have this prompt let's say um let's see given the following well here uh read the following review summaries of the product um these review summaries um uh let's see let's see these summaries capture a uh capture the over the general let's see the general sentiment of this product recommend um some possible changes to the product um some possible let's instead of changes let's say improvements because changes that doesn't specify which way so you got to be very careful um with your wording so some possible improvements to the product to make customers happier happier there we go okay so then we'll say recommended improvements to the product and then we'll just we'll tell it to start with a list and then we'll do prompt um improvements okay so then what we'll do is we'll come down here and instead of prompt.text we'll do prompt.improvements [Music] and so in this case we're basically automating you know just with a few steps we're going to we're going to we're going to audit the reviews of this product and then generate some actionable um oh what's the what's the term request from enhancement rfe um so we're going to basically generate an rfe um from just a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to assess customer sentiment and recommend improvements for a product, auditors can use a technique called "sampling." Sampling involves selecting a small number of reviews from the total pool of available reviews and analyze them to identify patterns. This technique can be used to audit the reviews of the Amazon Fire tablet.

Key strengths of the product, based on the reviews sampled, include its clear picture, nice size screen, and good price. However, some weaknesses were also identified, such as average battery life and charging port issues. Based on these findings, it is recommended that improvements be made to the product to address the identified weaknesses.
