TRANSCRIPT: itself again that's fine um okay so then let's say cognitive control because this is another super important concept um and i'm gonna try some of my tea it's probably still super hot but you can hear them a little congested okay cognitive control refers to the ability to regulate one's thoughts emotions and behaviors in order to achieve a desired goal so there's that goal thing again so cognitive control is largely mediated by the prefrontal cortex which is why we have forward foreheads rather than sloping foreheads like gorillas is to make room for the prefrontal cortex in our brain this is this is our command center this regulation occurs through the use of higher order cognitive processes such as attention working memory there you go and inhibitory control so inhibition that's one of the primary things that happens in the prefrontal cortex so um cool story is well not cool story so soldiers and people that survive car accidents and other head injuries they often have what's called tbi which is traumatic brain injury which is a microscopic injury to the prefrontal cortex people with tbi often lose the ability to inhibit themselves and so they basically acquire like sort of like a form of tourette's where they can't regulate their emotions i watched the documentary many years ago this is how i learned about it where a guy had he had he had tbi and he lost the ability to to censor himself and so he had gone from like a really like sweet caring person to this like verbally abusive husband and um and he was like i think i think my wife should leave me because i can't stop myself from hurting her now and she didn't want to leave him because she remembered how good he had been so just just to point out like um how how critical in his inhibition is um it towards you know these higher order cognitive processes and and being a good good person this is why impulse control like the marshmallow test is a huge predictor of how well you'll do in life okay side note side tangent done cognitive control is thought to be mediated by a distributed network of brain regions including the prefrontal cortex ah what did i say prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex that's anterior is going to be the front cingulate cortex what does that do i don't remember what that structure does and basal ganglia so that's down here this network is believed to interact with other brain regions such as the limbic system yep so that's the that's the emotional response in order to modulate emotions and influence behavior cognitive control is an important part of everyday life it allows us to set and achieve goals resist temptation and override impulses disruptions to cognitive control can lead to problems with attention decision making and impulse control okay so it basically said everything that i was telling you in my tangent so cognitive control this is going to be a really critical part of agi or artificial cognitive or sorry artificial cognitive entities ace because right now gpt3 just does whatever you tell it and it has no impulse control so that means we need a supervisor that will censor what gpt3 is doing and that's what i've proposed in my core objective functions which is reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding so basically what i'm proposing is that for agi or ace we give it a set of principles that it uses to police itself right because that is what impulse control is it's saying i'm going to make sure that i stick to um that i don't do anything bad right like the guy that i told you about that he he couldn't stop from like cursing out his wife or whatever um you know if if uh the so i actually have a good experiment from earlier in my artificial cognition research where um i called it prompt contamination where i was chatting with my early agi experiment and it thought that i was upset and then it believed it was upset and it started becoming abusive and i'm like wait no you're fine like uh so it couldn't discern the difference between myself and itself and i wasn't even upset i was just asking a question um i guess maybe it could have inferred that i was frustrated because i was asking the same question again and again um but anyways um so like separating self separating itself from myself that's another that's a whole other problem like identity that's the default mode network stuff actually let me add that this is just uh this video is just going default mode network we'll talk about that next um anyways so cognitive control um oh where was i um i lost that train of thought um higher order cognitive processes and inhibition i'll get back to it okay sorry this is like i said this is 3 3 20 in the morning me i need to sort through this because it's really important like i get this signal in my head saying hey hey hey like you know you're playing a video game and you get like a nagging mission objective it's like you should do this you should do this that's what's happening in my brain right now um okay so i'm kind of saying the same stuff over and over again so i'll just move on i think you get the point is that um oh that's what it was gpt3 doesn't have cognitive control we need to give it cognitive control with it with another system and that's one of the things i'm researching okay there we go um default mode network so this is cool so my earlier experiments with raven raven is the name of my agi raven couldn't tell the difference between itself and me and so this actually taught me that in order to achieve agi we're going to need to give it a sense of identity it's going to need to be able to separate itself from the rest of the world so yeah the default mode network is a set of brain regions that are active when a person is not actively engaged in a task the default mode network is sometimes re referred to as the task negative network because brain activities in these regions is typically lower when a person is focused on a task the dmn is thought to be involved in a variety of

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Cognitive control refers to the ability to regulate one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in order to achieve a desired goal. This regulation occurs through the use of higher order cognitive processes such as attention, working memory, and inhibitory control.

Cognitive control is largely mediated by the prefrontal cortex, which is why we have forward foreheads rather than sloping foreheads like gorillas. This is our command center. Disruptions to cognitive control can lead to problems with attention, decision making, and impulse control.

Cognitive control is an important part of everyday life. It allows us to set and achieve goals, resist temptation, and override impulses. However, disruptions to cognitive control can lead to serious problems.

One way to overcome these problems is to develop a sense of identity, or self-awareness. This can be done by training the brain to differentiate between itself and the rest of the world. The default mode network is a set of brain regions that are active when a person is not actively engaged in a task. The default mode network is thought to be involved in self-awareness and can help people to overcome disruptions to cognitive control.
