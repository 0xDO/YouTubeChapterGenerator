0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:03:32.220,0:03:39.300
let's see and also we're gonna keep we're going
to keep this in mind the whole time right so
0:03:40.020,0:03:45.780
let's just bold that um okay so then we got some
lists and points and then we actually want to
0:03:45.780,0:03:58.980
write the thing um okay so then we'll write the
actual sections um and then six uh iterate improve
0:03:59.580,0:04:10.560
the sections and then done and I okay so that's
where we'll start um I'm not going to dive into
0:04:10.560,0:04:16.740
automatically pulling from external sources
for this one for this we're going to start with
0:04:16.740,0:04:24.180
something simple because gpt3 already knows a lot
um but perhaps in a future version or a different
0:04:24.180,0:04:30.240
kind of thing I might explore like an automatic
Knowledge Graph Builder um because that's
0:04:30.240,0:04:35.460
something I've wanted to do anyways but for for
the for the sake of this one we're just going to
0:04:35.460,0:04:40.680
assume that gpt3 already has the information built
embedded in it somewhere because it's already read
0:04:40.680,0:04:45.060
a lot of news and Reddit and Wikipedia and
stuff so the topic that I was going to do
0:04:46.140,0:04:53.340
um was going to be Shinto in Japan because I'm
reading a book about Japanese history and culture
0:04:53.340,0:04:58.380
so it's something that I happen to know a little
bit about and of course like gpt3 has already read
0:04:58.380,0:05:03.720
all of Wikipedia on all of these things so I'm
going to assume that it has enough knowledge to
0:05:03.720,0:05:13.080
do this so first thing we're going to do is we're
going to go to the playground and we will say um
0:05:15.420,0:05:23.460
so basically we're going to start with some
prompt engineering I'll say um uh let's see
0:05:26.220,0:05:29.280
um write a blog outline
0:05:32.160,0:05:40.080
write a killer blog outline for the
following request from a customer okay
0:05:42.120,0:05:58.320
requests um I want a cool blog post about the
history of Shinto and Corey gates in Japan like
0:05:59.580,0:06:07.320
I'm basically adopting the percent of like a
surfer bro like uh how did they come up with that
0:06:07.320,0:06:19.500
idea what does it mean um and let's see and what
are the coolest ones to see I'm going to Japan
0:06:19.500,0:06:29.340
next summer because I'm a weeb sorry um I have a
bunch of friends who are uh was it xenophile would
0:06:29.340,0:06:35.340
be China what do you call it if someone is like
an actual term if someone is obsessed with Japan
0:06:36.060,0:06:39.900
they're into an anime and stuff I used to be
in high school my my high school girlfriend
0:06:39.900,0:06:43.620
got me into anime and I was into it for like
10 years and then I kind of like got over it
0:06:44.820,0:06:49.740
I'm still a nerd I'm not trying to defend
that okay write a killer blog uh outline
0:06:49.740,0:06:55.260
for the following uh request from a customer
all right so the request is this okay so now
0:06:55.920,0:07:07.500
um brainstorm a list of sections for this
blog post um each section uh let's see
0:07:08.640,0:07:20.820
uh let's see the outline should meet the customers
requests and each section should be let's say
0:07:20.820,0:07:35.040
highly descriptive provide a paragraph explaining
what should go should go into each section okay so
0:07:35.040,0:07:40.440
then we'll do sections and we'll start with one
so one thing that I do you'll notice uh often
