The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: pros and actually what we'll do is we'll declare the final blog as a list and so then we'll do um final blog dot append um Pros so that'll be a list of sections that we can then we can keep them separate so that we can give them headers and also we can continue to improve them separately if we want are we done hold on this is what happens to me I get so focused on what I'm doing that it's just like wait that's the end right I know there is one last thing but I want to see how this looks before we do the final step which is this one clean up the final product okay so let's give some whoops let's come back here let's get some output as we go so we'll print [Music] new line new line research um [Music] yeah so we'll do first we'll print new line new line section section use that variable right yep so then we do the section and then we do research because we need to we need something to look at while we're you know doing this um and I'll do print uh new line new line Pros and then we'll just copy this down here and then it'll be appended and so then finally here at the end of all things we will just do um here we'll do from P print import s so this is pretty print so we'll do pretty print final blog and this is just for debug okay so let's I need to zoom out a little bit because this is enormous well now let's see let's see how it looks okay generate a Blog end to end history of Shinto [Music] improved outline predictions for the future of the religion that's cool heck yeah oh wow that got real long so we're gonna have 10 sections we'll probably like accelerate this oops it crashed research is not defined what do you mean I did a typo let's see this is line 87. right here dang so close but this is why you test your code all right let's do this again all right I am going to make it a little smaller because this is outputting quite a bit so we'll do we'll go down to 24. there how to build a toy gate there we go oh we've got and we've got the double new lines so for the out for the final outline um outline equals outline dot replace and we'll do double new line with just single new line because we're going to end up with yeah okay but this is this is this is all right so far so good foreign and then the section has nothing yeah darn it darn it and it puts out nothing we'll just let it finish and see what happens there are about 80 000 Shinto shrines there's all of our research so that's good [Music] welcome to my blog about Shinto Okay cool so this is going to iterate through each of these sections for a little while I think I'm gonna go ahead and pause the video and uh we'll see because you get you get the idea we don't need to read this so we'll pause the video we'll come back once it's done it worked mostly um It produced a lot of content I'll put it that way um now unfortunately this was just a test run so we've got all this so let's just just get all this out to a text file and um so I I added this while we were waiting where it'll actually save it out to file because I should have done that and I'll probably separate out so that we'll clean up the blog afterwards but first let's just see what we've got so let's do a refined and replace the single quotes with nothing place all and then we'll replace um backslash backslash n with nothing actually no this will be normal finder place so that cleans that up yeah there we go um okay that is yeah there's a lot I'm not going to read the whole thing but we've got it's 21 000 characters long um so clearly this is like yeah this this this is quite a bit um I think what I'm gonna do uh because that's that's well how many tokens is this let's plug this into 50 5 000 tokens so we want it to be maybe half that maybe not quite as long so what we'll do is we'll do um just a little bit less research and a little bit less a little bit less brainstorming um so hopefully that will make it a little bit more reasonable because what I'd like to be able to do is to do the final Cleanup in one window um and we can't do that right now um Okay so we've got this I've got it so it'll save it out to file I wish that I had done this the first time but what we're going to do is we're going to choose an entirely different topic because I tested it on one topic um so I want a blog post about the history of the printing press I'd like to know how it influenced religion politics and War throughout history and up through the Modern Age um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and kick this off generate blog and then we'll come back with a brand new blog and then we will get into um we'll get into the um the process of improving a Blog automatically um why is it doing nothing did it not do any research oh there it is okay there we go um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and pause it and we'll come back in just a second okay we have a blog post about the printing press um and I think I actually lied I think I'm gonna call it here because this is actually not bad um and it doing improving an existing document is worth its own project so I think what's going to come after this is I'll have one video or a project about pulling from external sources like how to search and automatically compile sources because that has applications all over the place such as automated research for like Academia not just writing blogs and then automatically improving stuff at basically being an editor is a whole other function so we will call this a day get status get add git commit am all done and get push so uh yeah so there's a blog post out here it is now 10 000 characters long which means that it should fit into a single um yeah window so you could in theory ask gpt3 hey take this blog post and rewrite it if you want to I'm not going to worry about it um because yeah this video is already plenty long and you have you now have an end to end process of prompt chaining and recursive prompting um in order to generate you know be very generative and make something better remember use this responsibly I am not

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I walk through the process of generating a blog post about the history of the printing press. I show how to use recursive prompting and prompt chaining to come up with an outline for the blog post, and then I generate the content for the post using that outline.

I start by doing some research on the topic of the printing press and its history. I then brainstorm a list of ideas for the blog post, and use that list to generate an outline for the post. I then use the outline to generate the content for the post, and finally I clean up the final product to improve readability.

The end result is a blog post that is 10,000 characters long. This process can be used to generate content for any topic, and can be refined to produce even better results.
