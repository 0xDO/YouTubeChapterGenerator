The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: there is a completion now in this case the um the demarcator is reduced suffering let me zoom back in let's see reduce suffering where did it go um okay reduce suffering so this tells it what the instruction is this tells it which core objective function and then this passage indicates the person has suffered from isolation and feeling trapped and so this is the training data that you give you give it and then you end up with a model that in this case abides by my core objective functions so this first model in natural language natural language cognitive architecture the question generator that's for generating questions this one the core objective functions is for reducing suffering increasing prosperity and increasing understanding so that's a very different purpose you can you can browse through the data it's all in here under um as a json l file it actually looks like i didn't finish this experiment because i kind of realized that i needed to go a different direction but still generating synthetic data you can look at each of those steps in here and how i got it all this is going to be the most comprehensive one is the core objective functions and so lastly i created this um this chat bot and this one was fully synthetic i had no raw material so let me show you how i did this so there's a prompt let me show you this prompt and what it does when you come up into gpthree so i say eve is a digital life coach that uses compassionate listening and is inquisitive about the end user eve's goal is to understand the end user and help them untangle life problems every response should either ask a probing question so there's that term probing question provided definitive information or make a concrete suggestion so convo so this was one i actually had there was another prompt what was it synthetic prompt that's what it was so this is so there's um there's several several prompts um this one i actually realized was better so let me actually show you this one because this allows it to synthesize all i did was come up with a list of topics so let me show you that list of topics so what i did was and all the scripts are here actually this this repo is not public so you can't see that see this one um but yeah so i came up with a list of topics and then i fed it into this prompt and let me show you how effective this is um so navigating office politics so navigating office politics so all you do is just start here and the conversation starts with someone saying hey eve let me turn the temperature back down to 0.7 and watch what this does oh whoops i need to remove those we don't want it to stop here of course what's going on user well there's blah blah blah and so you see it's imagining an entire conversation entirely on its own all i did was give it say this is this is what the prompt is imagine a long text message chat between a life coach and a user the life coaches eve who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life eve frequently offers ideas and suggestions or teaches her client helpful facts eve maintains a professional tone the topic of the following conversation is navigating office politics okay so you see there's one synthetic conversation right there all i did was tell it what to do and it generated the entire thing the topic of this next one let's say um quantum physics just to show that this prompt is infinitely flexible do you know what do you know about quantum physics and then of course it gave up user let's say absolutely nothing i'm an idiot don't say that about yourself you're not an idiot you're just new to the topic and so look she says let's start with the basics quantum physics is the study of behavior and matergy at the subatomic levels um okay that makes sense how can quantum physics help me in everyday life um yeah so there you there you have it like any you just swap this out with any topic let's say um i'm not going to choose something controversial um let's see um oh here um doing taxes this is something that we all just recently had to do can be really tough to get started on taxes and then she makes a list etc etc there you have it yeah so this is these are some of my tips for making synthetic data um this repo was never meant to be public but the the fine tuning set that resulted from it is publicly available it's under here my gpt3 fine tunes under compassionate chatbot here's the data right here i do also have the synthetic prompt and the topics so what all that you need here is available under compassionate chatbot and i've even got the script to synthesize the conversations so that you just look at the topics and it'll synthesize all kinds of conversations for you so there you have it there is my tutorial on generating synthetic training data with gpt3 and for fine tuning have a good one thanks for watching remember to like and subscribe if you found this helpful

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro walks us through his process for generating synthetic training data using the GPT-3 machine learning platform. He begins by creating a prompt that defines the parameters of the conversation, including the topic, tone, and style. He then provides a list of topics for the machine to generate conversations about. Finally, he shows us the results of the synthetic conversations, which are surprisingly realistic and provide valuable insights into the topics covered.
