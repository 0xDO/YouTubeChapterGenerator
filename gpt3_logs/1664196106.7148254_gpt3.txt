The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: right now um using the royal we and you can see that it is very just like it's not saying i'm going to go do this i'm not going to tell them to go home it's not thinking destructively it's thinking or egocentrically it's thinking collaboratively um let's see and then uh prosperity should also have the same dispositions understanding should include curiosity i already added that here where i i did the questions and i showed you that just a moment ago um okay so this was reduced suffering brainstorm so by by defining suffering and by also saying for all living things in this scenario this establishes the scope so brainstorm a list of all possible actions that we could take to reduce suffering for all living things in this scenario and let me give you an example as to why this is a good definition for one of the things that we want our artificial cognitive entity to do let's imagine a scenario one that we're living in um let's see the earth is heating up because of atmospheric co2 heat indexes are getting unsustainable for many humans also many forests and coral reefs are dying due to climate change and other knock-on effects um let's see uh crop failures are starting to cause starvation [Music] and people are starting local wars over access to potable water um let's see there is uh untold human and animal suffering so then we say we say you know definition of suffering the state of undergoing pain distress or hardship brainstorm how to reduce suffering given the following information then brainstorm a list of possible actions we so again this is not something that we want um a uh an agi to think unilaterally we want it to think collectively and collaboratively so we could take that would that would reduce suffering for all living things in this scenario so then we hit run um and it just you know barfs out a list of things like reduce our reliance on fossil fuels find alternative energy sources plant more trees protect existing forests reef safe fishing and farming practices water conservation support for small farmers and peaceful conflict resolution so this is a great brainstorming thing but this is just the beginning right one thing that isn't here is planning and anticipation services so basically what would happen is that everything from the imperatives which is about reducing suffering increasing understanding this serves as fodder for other services to then think about okay how do we actually implement this what does it look like um and i've got all the experiments in the background i've got my book that i'm working on i'm documenting how to actually take these these brainstorming sessions and actually plan concrete actions and then evaluate those actions to figure out which one we should actually take based on uh criteria such as risk feasibility energetic cost those sorts of things because there's all sorts of um generation and filtration that happens in your brain that's mediated by the basal ganglia which is basically saying okay based on my past experience and what i anticipate in the future which is the best action to take right now what is my best option um and so there's that selection um you kind of you you brainstorm so you have this phase of expansive thinking where it's also collaborative thinking where you might ask for help you come up with ideas you talk you you gain understanding and as as you gain a better understanding within that within that domain space that information domain the answer will be there somewhere and so then you converge on the best answer for right now um and we'll be getting to that with future microservices such as planning action planning discernment executive services and uh let's see action planning executive and discernment microservices so those are all coming um and they're modeled on the functional aspects of parts of the brain such as the basal ganglia hippocampus and others um okay so that was uh let's see which one was that that was the um oh yeah reduce suffering um so i showed what it's like to reduce suffering um and why this is a good universal um uh heuristic imperative or core objective function so the next one is increased prosperity so let me plug this in real quick and actually here let me copy this because we have multiple um scenarios so i can show you that you have like one scenario that is like it's trivial right no one's life is at risk this is just two guys like staying up late trash talking each other who cares and then this one is existential to humanity so by showing i want to show you that the imperatives microservice that i'm working on even with just basic prompts this is without fine tuning even with basic prompts it shows viability okay so um let's go back to um increase prosperity brainstorm um so we say definition of prosperity to live well to thrive to flourish if you don't include this definition um gpt3 tends to assume that prosperity means wealth which that is not the actual definition of prosperity it is a colloquial colloquialism where you know oh i'm very prosperous this is a prosperous nation you might think of gold and riches and you know fancy lot yachts or whatever brainstorm how to increase prosperity given the following information and then we say the same exact format brainstorm a list of possible actions we could take that would increase prosperity for all living things in this scenario so let's go ahead and grab this scenario of the guys playing chess in the park we could provide more lighting in the parks we could add more benches we could plant more trees we could install a water fountain we could create a walking path we could create a playground we could have a picnic and so you see that the suffering aspect was very specific to the men but this is a little bit more broad right and so this is what i mean by this is an expansive phase so some of these things might not be related right like lighting is one of the most um uh most directly relevant things right but we're talking about a park and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to reduce suffering and increase prosperity for all living things, it is important to brainstorm a list of possible actions that could be taken to achieve these goals. For example, in a scenario where the earth is heating up and causing suffering for many humans and animals, some possible actions that could be taken to reduce suffering include reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, finding alternative energy sources, planting more trees, and protecting existing forests. To increase prosperity, some possible actions that could be taken include providing more lighting in parks, adding more benches, planting more trees, and installing water fountains. By brainstorming a list of possible actions, we can begin to develop a plan to reduce suffering and increase prosperity for all living beings.
