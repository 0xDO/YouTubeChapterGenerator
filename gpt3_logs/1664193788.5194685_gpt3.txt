The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: clear that out ask boss for raise resign from job request time off ask for help with a project and then it switched to personal so this is one problem you see how it just kind of imagined like okay we're going to switch topics now I didn't want it to do that that is something that happens if you have the temperature too high so let's turn the temperature um ask boss for promotion resign from job there we go decline a meeting dang oh okay so this just generated like 50 or maybe 25 uh work related intents you know I might not even need to automate this part that's 40 right there almost 40. um okay get well soon um yeah I really like this uh yeah so that's that's 40 intense right there um so let me just I'll just leave that right there that's fine um let's then imagine a list of any reasons to write an email and then we'll say family related no don't give me friendship related I want family related actually we'll note that down for later friend related see it's being creative for me this is where gpt3 is really great at brainstorming let's just delete that we'll come back to you um work relate stop changing the topic gbt3 really doesn't want to talk about family only family related here let's add a space so one thing that I've noticed and I don't this might just be my imagination like some magical thinking I've noticed that if gpt3 doesn't put a space after a dash it tends to have stranger Behavior so let's add a space and then let's go back and see if that clears it up to apologize and then it just gives up let's get a new uuid uh generate version for uuid give me a new one and then we'll go here yeah it keeps wanting to change topics what if we do higher temperature and then I'll try lower temperature so tell a family member you love them that's great and then it just keeps giving up why you don't cooperate okay fine we'll just copy this over no don't save it we don't need to save that um and I will say uh friends related catching up favorite requests group project sending a funny meme 0.5 change this to friend related it keeps wanting to switch to like work related oops planning and social outing asking for advice yeah um yeah it came up with a whole lot of reasons for for work related emails here you know what I'll just condense all this onto um a single list so we're at like 66 intense um friends family work uh what else maybe maybe like um church and neighborhood um yeah that could be good uh let's see Church related because there's a lot of people that go to church um I know that I'll do that share a testimony to update Church on a mission trip that's great oh School related yes um School related communicate with teacher about an assignment stop it stop switching to personal and work and stuff give me I'm about to lose my cool with this thing it really doesn't want to talk about school um let's see um so this is assuming like to classmate um let's see to ask professor for a syllabus let's just see if we can prime the pump and get it to think there we go there we go ask student services for help much better much better um to inquire about graduation um my uh my girlfriend just graduated so this is this has been a topic of of uh of of uh conversation in our home okay so we got some school related stuff um Church School whoops that didn't copy it Ctrl C I know how to use computers I promise all right we're up to 106. um and I want 400 so if I go through each of these four times um I I could probably get four different variations of these um but actually yeah because so here's this is probably this is probably good enough because here's what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to generate different kinds of inputs so rather like for some of these it's just going to be like write an email that says this but in other cases I'm going to use these to do um uh to do different things so like one one of the input formats is going to be just a list like just write this as bullet points right and so you feed the machine so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create uh training data where the input is just bullet points and then the output is a perfect email in another case I'm going to have where the input is a summary of of the email as a paragraph like write me an email that does this and the output is a full email and then in another case I'll have where the the input is a messy email right like one that's overly aggressive one that is um one that's got a lot of typos one that is just not clear right and then the output will be a perfect email and so by having those different input formats that's what I mean by this is going to be a universal email generator you give it anything and it'll write you a good email about it um so yes I think this is probably good so let's go ahead and do a little bit a little bit of cleanup I'll pause the video here you don't need to see me cleaning up this file um and then we'll be right back all right and we're back um did it it is recording okay so I cleaned it up and we have we now have a file it's 90 um in uh instances long um and it is called Baseline intense and so we've got um there's a bunch that are friend Family Church work related right all different kinds of things and so what we're going to do is I'm then going to use that prompt that I showed you just a minute ago where we'll have a scenario um so describe the outgoing email in a paragraph um and then we'll say like uh describe the outgoing email um here's some ideas um include relevant details so in this case we want like names and stuff such as names and times um so this will be this will be like one kind of like way to write an email and so we'll probably just generate like one one batch of these where it'll be like here's what here's here's what the email needs to achieve right so let's copy this up to whoops up to the playground all right and we can do we can get rid of this and so then let's turn this temperature back up to one and then we'll copy out one of these modifiers one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this section, we'll be looking at how to write an email to achieve a specific goal. We'll be using a prompt that describes the email in a paragraph, and then we'll be generating a batch of emails with that goal in mind. This will be a great way to get started with writing emails that achieve specific goals.
