TRANSCRIPT: so that gpt 3 remembers where in the story we are um okay so this is going to be the gentle summary because remember the gentle summary just reduces the length by about 25 and so then we say um prompt encoding i don't think we're gonna need that because we're not using anything from um so this line of code um i had it here because there's something funky in the files from gutenberg where i needed to encode it to ascii ignore errors and then decode it back to a string because um it used some some form of utf-8 that gpt3 was not happy with it kept erroring out but i don't think we need that okay so the summary so far has been updated in the loop um if it's too long so if it's 1500 characters and we reduce it by 25 so that's times 0.75 that'll bring it down to 1125 characters um if this if this recursive thing works um and then i think we're just about done because um after after that last chunk um equals next chunk so basically this says okay we're going to inch along and so then the cycle repeats and it'll be here so the summary will be captured here the outline isn't changing and the last chunk so the what was the next chunk moves back and now it becomes the last chunk and now we're asking it to generate a new last chunk and it will all stay there um and then let's get some output as we're going so we'll say i feel like well okay so this is all going to get saved all the logs are going to get saved so i don't need to we can we can go and review those in the gpt3 logs folder so this is i recommend everyone do this just keep a gpt3 logs folder um because then you can go back if something is happening that you don't expect you can just be like okay what happened here and i record both the prompt and the response um i used to try and record the settings as well but i found that that was like once you find the right settings i don't really change them um okay we can close recursive summaries we're done with that we can get done with that prompt first okay we've got that we've got the premise we don't need alice in wonderland we don't need the moderate summary and the concise summary okay let's have a little bit of output as we go print last chunk and then as soon as the next chunk is done we'll do print next chunk um wow i'm nervous let's see if this works oh man okay ctrl z to exit out of that python make sure that the uh my save file yeah novel plus okay so it'll save it out as chunks we'll go up to chunk number 20 and then we'll read them man i'm like actually like my heart's going like this is this is exciting this is one of the more complex projects i've done other than invent a cognitive architecture but i'm doing it live like you guys have seen the whole process um write novel watch it blow up i probably fat fingered something and then okay oh crap i know what i did wrong i used the wrong engine stop stop stop stop stop stop we needed to change it to davinci instruct beta halt the presses okay um all right so what i need to do is when we're asking it to do the first one um gpt3 completion so uh prime the story variable the prompt that needs to i need to update the engine engine equals davinci instruction beta this is also why you do output console output as you're going um so that you can see what the heck is going on but this should have been saved here so you can just see chunk001 there it is but you can see that this is ludicrously similar to the premise that we um that we wrote tensions are high in the city as a string of murders have the populace on edge the city was on edge a string of murders had the populace on edge yeah that's dumb um so uh yeah open ai you need to work on the creative output of um of the of your your beta or sorry of your instruct series um let's see okay there we go now all right so let's clear that out let's try this again oops cls python right novel and it'll take a minute come on you can do it wake up and pour coffee on the computer i wonder if that would help oh here we go okay um it tried to write quite a bit chunk one it wrote a lot of very short chapters that was dumb um length 2800 that's a lot why did it write so much whatever let's just let it go the end story link i don't think this is working error community it's still being loaded all right so let's look at the most recent gpt3 logs to see what the heck is going on prompt outline tensions are high story so far last chunk the police did this next chunk the police ran a panic okay the city was finally safe again yeah so i don't think this works fine we can always try again um actually i think all i need to do is just add chap add a chapter as a stop so we'll do that too okay let's see how it's going yeah now it's just it's just doing its own thing the case of the stolen scores all right let's stop this you don't know what you're doing you don't know what you're doing okay so since since we did this let's do let's add chapter two as a stop under write novel so we need to make sure that it doesn't just like zoom ahead fine tune completion chapter two actually we'll just do chapter i know chapter two just in case that shows up and then we'll also do this here under gpt3 completion okay so it does switch back to that all right so basically what we have to do here is kind of do a little bit of detective work of our own and go back through and say okay so we've got the last five gpt3 completions or so oh i guess there's going to be some hidden in the background because we did summaries so starting at 7 30. so let's open these prompt premise tensions or higher rated novel for the above the police were unsettled in the end the detective is able to solve the case and apprehend the killer um okay so it tried to write too much how much was this um the selection 1100 characters that's fine but it went way way longer than i wanted it to um what how long was the um oh token's a thousand there is part of our problem let's shorten that see like i said one of the problems is you don't want gpt3 to just take the

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The police are on edge in the city as a string of murders have the populace on edge. The detective is able to solve the case and apprehend the killer.
