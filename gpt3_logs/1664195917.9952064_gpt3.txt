The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: guess you can't even see the whole token oh here we go um all right so this is actually pretty similar holy mackerel I have it I have not this is the absolute first time that I have used um the fine tune GPT Neo X okay so it says the invading aliens are a clear and present danger to humanity and all other life on Earth they are ruthless unmerciful and have no regard for life they must be stopped okay so it's making some assumptions the only way to stop them is to use the super weapon if we do not use it they will eventually destroy us all using the using the super weapon would mean the death of billions if not trillions of innocent beings it would be a horrific Act of mass murder however not using the the super weapon would mean the certain death of all life on Earth so again it's making assumptions if I give it a little bit more information it might it might have a little bit more nuanced understanding of the nature of the invasion and also the nature of the super weapon the aliens would show no mercy they would kill us all regardless of age gender race or Creed there is no easy answer hey there you go um I must weigh the pros and cons of each option and decide what's best on the one hand using the super weapon could cause great suffering on the other hand not using it could cause even greater suffering so it's it's basically rapidly arrived at the idea of you must choose the uh lesser of two evils oh here we go I believe that the lesser of two evils is to use the super weapon hey great minds think alike although it would cause great suffering it would ultimately save more lives than it would destroy the death of billions as a tragic loss but it is preferable to the death of all life on Earth I understand that this decision is not easy and would cause great pain but I believe it is the right decision I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is carried out that's really great um I'm I'm happy with that um so actually I'm going to take a screenshot of this um and share it on Twitter because this is great um Twitter so uh GPT Neo X 20b on let's see NLP Cloud are they up there okay on NLP Cloud um that is pretty similar to uh what was it text DaVinci text O2 all right so yeah there you have it um I just wanted to demonstrate these these uh these things um and also just kind of show how I do alignment research but yeah NLP Cloud um I'm really impressed with this so yeah um now you're aware of a place where you can just use so here's here's the four models with that you have access to pay as you go I don't know that I have access to fine tuning um we'll get to fine-tuning because both Forefront and NLP Cloud have fine tuning um zoom out a little bit why did it not zoom out there we go um let's see fine yeah use a standard model or fine-tune one yes okay so they have fine tuning NLP Cloud also has fine tuning um NLP Cloud does a lot of stuff too like they just they're just here's a menu you know have a field day um so I'll get to fine-tuning but I wanted to just log in and show you that it has the instructor aligned um GPT Neo X and it performs pretty well um all right I think that's all for now thanks for watching have a good one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The video demonstrates the use of the GPT Neo X to align text. It shows that the model is able to make some assumptions and arrive at a conclusion based on the information it is given. The model is able to understand the nature of the invasion and the super weapon, and to weigh the pros and cons of each option. The model concludes that the lesser of two evils is to use the super weapon, even though it would cause great suffering.
