TRANSCRIPT: about the macroscopic level how about the whole brain right because we can have you can you can train a uh a virtual neural network or an artificial neural network that has the equivalent of like a thousand neurons or um let's see uh let's see gpt3 has 175 billion and it's roughly um a thousand per so gpt3 has 175 billion parameters but it takes roughly a thousand parameters to model one human neuron so that means gpt3 is the equivalent of about 175 million neurons um so and the human brain has like 90 billion so we're we're still a few orders of magnitude off excuse me um and so we've got the so there's there's two primary ways to model the brain there's the structural model which is where you copy the regions and connectivity of the brain so basically you're copying the organic structure and this is what you might have heard uh called whole brain simulation so um ib i think it was ibm was working on the connectome where it was modeling the connectivity of like the entire brain because that's still that's the structural model of saying hey let's go and just copy this but in virtual i don't think that's necessarily the best way to go so the other model is the functional model so the functional model is where you identify discrete functions of the brain such as memory learning visual processing morality whatever you say okay let's treat morality as its own function and then let's copy that and then you wire it all together like a software application specifically like a microservices application i take the functional model approach it is prohibitively expensive and difficult to map the entire brain and then to run a whole brain simulation i also don't know that it's ethical because here's the thing if you have if you put a brain in a jar and then you turn it on like it's not going to have any sensory input unless you fabricate sensory input and it's not going to have any sensory output unless you give it like a virtual body and what if that brain is sitting there panicking because it's like i don't have a body i don't know how to breathe right um they actually explored this in caprica so caprica was a uh was a show that was like a prequel to battlestar galactica and one of the guys uh like his daughter died in a terrorist attack and so then he re i think it was caprica he recreated her virtually but he forgot to give her her virtual like body sensations so like she couldn't breathe and she couldn't feel her her heartbeat and she's like why wha what's wrong with me why am i like this and that was a perfect example of why i think that whole brain simulation is probably super unethical um it's just a fictional example but still okay so we've got the structural model functional model i prefer the functional model because like we don't have to reconstruct a brain with 400 you know million or help 3.5 billion years of evolution we can just design something from the ground up that's better okay so microservices architecture of the bay of the brain like what like how would we do this what are some of the domains so some of the functional domains that you can think about are input so we've got sensations but for a machine you have the possibility of other kinds of input other than the senses that we have right so we evolved the two primary ways we take in information are sight and sound vast majority of the data we take in the information is through those senses but a machine can have apis it can talk to the web it can talk directly to other machines so you can have microservices that handle input and sensations um you have output right which is actions controlling peripheral devices speaking robotic arms that sort of thing then you can have executive functions so this is where we still model the functional aspect of the human brain so the human brain has the basal ganglia which is responsible for task selection and task switching and so this is when someone says like executive function this is this is kind of the fundamental part of what what they're talking about now damage to the prefrontal cortex can also um impair executive function but in terms of like what you're behaviorally doing right right like if you're listening to someone and you know you decide to interrupt them that is a um if you interrupt someone in in inappropriately that is a failure of the prefrontal cortex because a prefrontal cortex um is responsible for self-censorship so that you can behave in polite society but then the actual task of speaking goes out through the basal ganglia where it says i'm going to select this task or i'm going to switch to a new task i'm summarizing if you're a neuroscientist i probably got some of this wrong but in general this is this is good enough for understanding where we're going from here um other things are like planning and strategizing we can think very far into the future in fact human time horizon of thought is many orders of magnitude above most other animals with very few exceptions i think i think elephants and some birds can think pretty far ahead but in the in some cases it's like okay is that instinct like are they actually planning um but you know like uh elephants can as a herd kind of collectively decide like where to go um and you know like say for instance there's a drought they can remember like okay we got to get back to where there's water and we know that there's water you know 160 miles in that direction granted elephants can also travel like 40 miles a day so that's only four days out ahead humans however we can think years decades um centuries into the future um just just having that that mental concept of that of that temporal scale is completely unique to humans um we can also anticipate and predict now the ability to anticipate and predict things is not unique to humans however the kinds of things that we can anticipate and predict are so for instance we can anticipate or predict if you like say for instance you learn well enough you can look at a weather map and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

At the macroscopic level, the whole brain is the primary focus. This is because a virtual neural network or an artificial neural network can be trained to have the equivalent of a thousand neurons. However, the human brain has about 90 billion neurons. This means that the virtual network is still a few orders of magnitude off from being able to replicate the human brain. There are two primary ways to model the brain: the structural model and the functional model. The structural model is where you copy the regions and connectivity of the brain. This is what is known as whole brain simulation. The functional model is where you identify discrete functions of the brain, such as memory, learning, visual processing, and morality. The functional model is more difficult to replicate, but it is also more ethical. This is because, in a whole brain simulation, a brain in a jar would be panicking because it would have no body and no way to breathe. The functional model is the preferred model because it does not require reconstruction of the brain with 400 million or 3.5 billion years of evolution. Instead, it can be designed from the ground up. The microservices architecture of the brain would be similar to a software application, with input, output, and executive functions. Input would be sensations, but for a machine, there could be other kinds of input, such as the ability to talk to the web or other machines. Output would be actions, such as controlling peripheral devices or speaking. Executive functions would be responsible for task selection and task switching. The ability to think years, decades, or centuries into the future is unique to humans and is made possible by the prefrontal cortex.
