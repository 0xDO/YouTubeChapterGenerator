how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:42.660,0:04:48.480
writing this just a few times 500
per month good and then so here
0:04:48.480,0:04:51.960
also when you're doing synthetic data
I often turn the temperature up higher
0:04:54.960,0:05:04.380
um yep cool okay so this is obviously getting a
little bit repetitive there will be more entropy
0:05:04.380,0:05:10.740
when I when we fill this out um but this is
definitely good enough um so then we'll do
0:05:10.740,0:05:17.940
a placeholder here so we'll do uh nope that's
the uuid and then we'll do a placeholder here
0:05:17.940,0:05:26.160
for modifier okay and then we'll delete this and
so basically this is going to be this is not the
0:05:26.160,0:05:33.300
helper bot one this is the perfect email generator
so this will be prompt to form intents and so then
0:05:33.300,0:05:40.860
what I'll do is um we will go to the script that I
copied from uh previous one and we'll just modify
0:05:40.860,0:05:49.380
this so this is a super simple script all it
does is it loads a prompt um and then uh actually
0:05:49.380,0:05:55.260
no this was this was a little bit different um
so we're going to well first we can just clear
0:05:55.260,0:06:00.060
all all this out because I don't think I need
to reuse this but the rest of it I can reuse
0:06:01.260,0:06:09.240
okay uh so then we need to have a list of
modifiers up here so we'll say um modifiers
0:06:09.240,0:06:19.920
equals and then we'll do um uh let's see so we
have all kinds of intents we say um uh let's see
0:06:21.300,0:06:28.980
um how did I how did I do it in this example email
to boss ask for raise okay email to boss asked for
0:06:28.980,0:06:39.000
raise um and then you know actually because I'm
gonna have I'm gonna aim for 400 different things
0:06:40.440,0:06:46.500
so I don't want to have like yeah there's
gonna be some variants but like each one
0:06:46.500,0:06:52.800
of these is only going to give me about
five good good different things of variance
0:06:55.260,0:07:01.080
because ideally it would invent
these modifiers on its own
0:07:03.780,0:07:06.900
let me think about this for a second I'm going to
pause I'm going to pause the recording and think
0:07:06.900,0:07:12.720
about how to how to how to fully offload the
creative process because I want gpt3 to write
