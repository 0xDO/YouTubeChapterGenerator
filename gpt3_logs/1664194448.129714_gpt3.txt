The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: label and content i'm going to basically save each of these each of these bits or whatever save it out so that i can see what it's doing all right so we'll do save debug um we'll say convo uh we'll just say convo and we'll do convo block um so that'll be there and then [Music] the title here we'll do save debug wiki title and we'll say title so we can see what it's getting save debug wiki article and we'll do quickie so let's just save what it got and then [Music] save debug we'll say question and then save debug answer um yeah that should be good okay so we've got a few few inter intermediary steps um and i might add some more debug output but that should be fine for now user um hey tim can you teach me about particle physics and this might take a second let me open the debug folder oh nope it blew up save debug wiki article right content it really does not like something that's going on in here because it tried to save the wiki article and it blew up all right so we will borrow our ascii code thing from here it's just something i don't know what i don't know if it's something i'm doing or if i need to do encoding something or other but whatever all right so for the wiki article um fetch wiki so we will do um when it fetches it wiki.content and then we'll do encode and then decode all right but let's see so it got it got that far before blowing up it got down to here where it tried to save the wiki article so let's take a quick look in debug convo okay let's save the convo particle physics and then that blew up that makes sense all right let's close some of these things because they are all excess noise um all right let's go back here hey tim not time can you teach me about particle physics and then it might take a second before it blows up well let's see what happens and obviously this is too slow because that fine-tuned model was much better one of the most fundamental oh that's a good question most fundamental particles in the universe presumably invisible okay it doesn't say quarks does it okay oh hey look at this look at this oh man this is perfect oh oh whoops i forgot to add the the uh particle six is the study of the fundamental subatomic level it's a branch physics that explores okay cool um i needed to add the stop but look at that that was good that was really good okay let's pause real quick because i want to look at the debug and um okay so it got that far and then let's look at the gbt3 chat logs um yeah so the last one prompt imagine a long text message user and so then it added and what i needed to do is add these as stops um it didn't add the hint though did i forget to populate in the hint because that should have been there various answers okay that's fine these include leptons quarks oh it did have it but then there was only one okay i need to actually so first let's skip this if there is only one so let's go back here um so answer question so merge um because we assumed that there would be a chunk um but there might not be right um so if length of answers equals one then we just return answers zero that should be fine okay so we can short circuit it because we only we only need to to split this up um and answer multiple if the document is too long okay so let's fix that and then it did not like it didn't replace the hint so prompt chat hint is there oops come back okay so let's fix that um so that's the chat that's the chat prompt and then if we go into gpt3 logs this is should be the last one and it just goes straight from user to tim this is really weird how is that even possible because that made it here that's right there but it completely erased all right well first let's fix this other thing because the stop is going to need to include user and tim alright so we got to fix that um prompt chat text replace block replace hint with answer and i saved the answer right so let's open debug answer oh i know what i did wrong oh that's what i did okay so the chat block but then i need to have the hint okay and then tim's output yeah because this is okay so the hint was here it just it wasn't labeled correctly i clearly have not had enough coffee yet today but then tim's answer was really good okay i think i fixed all the bugs fix the bug fix the bugs okay so let's control z out of that clear that make sure everything is saved actually let's do uh get status um i want to exclude my api key did i not have a git ignore in this i don't um new and so we'll do open ai api key dot text and save this as dot git ignore do not save it into the debug folder save it here hit add dot get ignore get status okay get add all get commit am should be working get push it's always like i don't trust it when it works the first time i guess it didn't quite work the first time but like i saved all the debug and you saw like right i'm not imagining things like particle physics it gave me a wiki title here is the actual article and here's a question what are the most fundamental particles in the universe which is great and here's the answer um which you know it i inappropriately summarized it but like that worked that worked okay fix the prompt chat um print line out and then we just go back to here so user says input user let's add a space there um that should be good because that's tim and there is the space okay good good good good um cls chat um can you teach me about particle physics give it a second it'll go through and churn everything in the background we'll wait for that to finish and then we'll check on um you can see here it's going through um particle physics is the studies of the properties of particles such as electrons and photons cool okay so let's see what is the difference between a particle and a wave that's a good one a particle is a small object of individual mass that's fine it did not make it into the final output but let's take a look can you teach me about particle physics so it was in there but tim decided not to use it interactions between particles such as the force

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Particle physics is the study of the fundamental subatomic level of the universe. This branch of physics explores the various interactions between particles, such as the force. Particle physics is a branch of physics that explores the various interactions between particles, such as the force.
