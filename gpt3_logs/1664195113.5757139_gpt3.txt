The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: correct so say for instance you're at a party and you say i'm gonna tell a joke so you're you you think about the joke that you're gonna tell and then you say it and then you you know ideally everyone laughs right everyone's like oh that was a real knee slapper or whatever and so then you self-check people did what you expected them to do you did right so you've got a positive fine-tuning data point you know in your head but if you tell a joke and everyone's like that was cringe you're like i didn't do so good that time did i so that's what i mean by self-check and self-correction is given those data points of successes and failures how do you integrate that and behave better in the future that is and that is coming in the roadmap for raven um and then finally once we have these first two things which is trust through privacy security reliability and utility and then we master self-improvement which so self-improvement with with artificial cognition is largely a data problem but it can also be a coding problem and we'll get into all that in the future so then have earned your trust raven should eventually be granted autonomy so what do i mean by autonomy um you know everyone's afraid of skynet materializing one day and killing everyone right that's that's what we're afraid of we're afraid of the machine getting autonomy and then deciding to kill us well if we get ahead of the curve and we design something that is benevolent by design that is reliable and safe and has demonstrated that it adheres to principles that we trust and appreciate then it can be granted some control over itself right in stages so say for instance um you know how like you can install venmo on your phone and then your phone becomes a financial utility raven will be no different that's where the vast extensible network comes in um where there's going to be functionality that you had to raven so let's just say that in the future in five or ten years there's venmo for raven so you say hey raven install venmo and then you say okay hey raven i want you to take care of my bills from now on and raven will say okay i'll take care of your bills from now on i've installed venmo and now i can handle your finances um so that's what i mean by granting some autonomy and then over time and this will take many many years uh make no mistake i'm talking about 20 to 50 plus years because we're going to need to demonstrate this reliability over many many years and possibly multiple generations to see how far it goes but the future is coming it's closer than you think um so for this mvp there's two primary features one is that it is voice enabled um which you just heard um and then it can cover multiple domains and topics um i just gave a couple like hands-on examples where i you know showed like hey i'm having my life is a disaster apparently the kitchen is on fire my car won't start i can't find a hotel um you know so on and so forth um this uh repo it includes um relatively detailed instructions on how to get this set up um i just went through it myself because i had reinstalled my computer so i had to do all this from scratch these instructions work the hardest part is signing up for the google google cloud api stuff um fortunately though this is such low bandwidth that i have in all my testing i have spent a grand total of 11 cents on on on text-to-speech and speech-to-text services from google um so it's very cheap the more expensive part is open ai which you'll need to fine-tune the model all that is here so then let's talk about the fine-tuning data that i used for this so right now this does not have a cognitive architecture i talked about cognitive architecture but really this is super simple let me show you let's just go over the code real quick um do to do raven mvp let's zoom in so this is a grand total of 227 sorry 226 lines of code um it is not that complicated um there's here's the main loop right here where all it does is it listens to the microphone until speech is returned from the api um so it'll just wait and then it'll uh it will give you um it'll append that to the conversation so it'll accumulate the conversation um in a uh in a list um and then it listens for if you're going to end the conversation which there's just a few static catch phrases so this is what you'd call a user intent so this is where the extensibility will come in in the future is every time you say something raven will check for your intent are you intending to you know add a calendar entry are you telling raven something that's going to happen in the future are you asking raven to change its behavior right that's something that we need to say like if you say raven i don't like it when you talk to me like that can you talk a different way that's something that we want it to be able to integrate and learn so then we have a phase of of detecting user intent and then we use the fine-tuned model to generate a response so it's just input process output this is one loop um so this is not the full cognitive architecture which let me show you what that looks like so the full cognitive architecture has two loops uh there's the in there's the outer loop which is what i just showed you which is input processing and output right now it only has a microphone in the future raven will have microphones it'll have cameras all sorts of things i've started working on a smart home device so that like raven will live on your wall and and it's got a touch screen and so raven can watch you and observe you but if you have an ai thing that's watching you 24 7 you want to make damn sure that that data is secure right um so there's there's this uh there's this thing called fully homomorphic encryption which means the data that it records about you can be fully encrypted and raven can still use that data but that data can never be exfiltrated so that's another problem we gotta work on and then the other thing that i've been working on is um is the inner loop which is kind

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Self-checking and self-correction are important aspects of artificial cognition that will help machines learn and improve over time. The goal is to eventually earn our trust so that machines can be granted autonomy. This can be done by demonstrating reliability over many years and possibly multiple generations.
