0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:33:45.060,0:33:51.240
right someone's gonna say I'm gonna jack up the
price the difference is um all of the open source
0:33:51.240,0:33:57.120
people making sure that access to this technology
is democratized so you've got Nvidia you've got
0:33:57.120,0:34:02.160
Microsoft you've got Google you've got a Luther
right you've got hugging face you've got all kinds
0:34:02.160,0:34:07.920
of players both for-profit and not-for-profit
you've got open source players all competing
0:34:07.920,0:34:13.740
to make sure that this stuff is is accessible to
everyone and that is going to really really push
0:34:13.740,0:34:20.700
down the cost of these models and these services
and again remember earlier all the leaps forward
0:34:20.700,0:34:25.020
that we're going to see in Computing means that
even these big expensive models are going to be
0:34:25.020,0:34:30.720
10 times cheaper to train 100 times cheaper to
run and this is in the next year or two right so
0:34:30.720,0:34:37.080
we're going to see this exponential early growth
of or I guess exponential decrease in cost right
0:34:38.040,0:34:43.500
um exponential decay in terms of marginal cost to
run and train these things which means everyone's
0:34:43.500,0:34:49.740
going to be able to access it like my my my
three-year-old GPU is big enough to run stable
0:34:49.740,0:34:55.380
diffusion right and so people are going to refine
these models get them more efficient more cheap
0:34:55.380,0:35:00.420
and that means everyone's going to be able to run
it every startup every company even people at home
0:35:00.420,0:35:06.360
are going to be able to run these models and it is
impossible to say what that's going to do to not
0:35:06.360,0:35:11.940
just the economy but your day-to-day life because
again imagine that you get to you know age 50 60
0:35:11.940,0:35:19.500
70 and you know they take they take a sample
of blood run your run your uh genome and say
0:35:19.500,0:35:25.740
okay you need you know this this and this mRNA
vaccine we're going to cure your your Alzheimer's
0:35:25.740,0:35:32.700
we're going to cure your high blood pressure your
cholesterol um and also your um your um uh what
0:35:32.700,0:35:38.820
is it the brittle Bones the um I can't remember
the word right now anyways like that is within
0:35:38.820,0:35:43.140
the realm of possibility and I'm not saying
like that like that that personalized medicine
0:35:43.140,0:35:49.920
10 years maximum 20 30 maximum probably 20 27
if I had to guess right now just the way that
0:35:49.920,0:35:54.360
things are accelerating at an exponential
rate again is it going to be exponential
0:35:54.360,0:35:59.040
forever or are we going to get diminishing
our turns we will get diminishing returns but
0:36:00.060,0:36:06.300
especially in the field of energy and AI we are
not anywhere near the top especially when you
0:36:06.300,0:36:10.200
get the compounding returns from advances
in Computing okay I'm repeating myself
0:36:11.460,0:36:16.500
lastly I had someone ask me to comment on this
the build of building a virtual machine inside
0:36:16.500,0:36:25.380
chat gbt so this is where yes it's really cool but
there are problems to solve so the the problem is
0:36:25.380,0:36:32.520
confabulation making stuff up when you have
the ability to be infinitely creative it is a
0:36:32.520,0:36:38.940
double-edged sword because you need to be creative
to solve problems like cancer like climate change
0:36:38.940,0:36:46.500
however if you are creative without constraints
so that's that's the that's the key thing is uh
0:36:46.500,0:36:52.140
so I guess a way of understanding confabulation
it is creativity without any constraints then
0:36:52.140,0:36:56.640
you just kind of Go off into La La Land and and
it's a dream world and so that's what this person
0:36:56.640,0:37:02.940
did where he said I want you to act as a Linux
terminal so this machine hopefully says okay I
0:37:02.940,0:37:10.500
am now a Linux terminal and everything you see
from here is pretend it's not actually a virtual
0:37:10.500,0:37:16.920
machine it just understands the behavior of the
virtual machine well enough to be able to emulate
0:37:16.920,0:37:24.540
that that behavior to pretend right which is a
really great capacity right I don't want to say
0:37:24.540,0:37:32.820
that this is bad this is good the fact that it
is capable of doing this um that it understands
0:37:32.820,0:37:39.900
things this well um is and can pretend that
means that it's got a very good mental model
0:37:40.620,0:37:49.080
like an internal model of the world of machines so
this this what this means is this model chat GPT
0:37:49.080,0:37:55.080
understands technology well enough to pretend
and if you have enough if you have enough
