The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with a brand new video um this video is going to be the promised um educational chat bot um i'm going to basically just copy paste from my last video the companion chat bot because that pattern works um but let's do a little prompt engineering first so um let's see here's our prompt um this was the prompt that i used to have the open-ended chat bot so it's like imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user the life coach is eve who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life eve frequently offers ideas suggestions or teaches her clients helpful facts eve maintains a cool professional tone the topic of the following conversation is topic and then i replace that with topics so this prompt works really well so basically what i want to do is just take what works imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a student um let's see we'll just say user um the tutor is tim who um oh what is the name of the teaching method i used to date a teacher i should know this um tim who who um oh man i really wish that i knew this uh okay well we can get back to it or no let me ask what are some formal teaching techniques teaching communication techniques and protocols write a list let's see if this works if i can jar my memory establishing rapport giving and seeking feedback active listening non-verbal asking questions clarifying now there's there's a there's a specific term in education today anyways um this is fine okay um who encourages curiosity so okay um tim uh let's see uh tim answers questions with thorough academic responses and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity let's see okay tim maintains a cool professional professional tone um the topic of the following conversation is okay topic okay so basically i just like adapted this previous prompt and then let's imagine some topics so in the in the previous version actually here let me let me bring up the original uh companion chat bot so you can see so what i did was i created a whole bunch of topics that i could just swap in and out and in this case like some of them were like just let's talk about anger control issues or road rage but in other ones it's you know the user makes sexual advances that eve but she says repeated violations will result in her terminating their relationship gpd3 is really good at turning those prompts into conversations when matched with this um i'm not going to try and be adversarial here with the with the companionship chat bot that has a much higher likelihood of being adversarial um actually i need to get my tea we'll fix it in post um because i'm getting better at this uh okay so where was i um yes uh an open-ended chat bot is much more likely to need to be tested um for adversarial uh reasons like sexual advances or people basically just trying to break it also i'm wondering if this is not close enough um that should be okay i did turn the gain up a little so i apologize if there's any background noise it's pretty quiet in here anyways so looking at these topics let's imagine some some topics for educational purposes um so i added a couple at the end of the companion chat bot so like um history of rome let's see and this is the topic of the conversation is and we'll just add a semicolon so that way it's like obvious um history of rome um mitochondria because everyone knows mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell let's see dinosaurs let's see user asks user asks how to build a gun so tim talks about the history of modern firearms so this is this is a case where like you can imagine a middle schooler or a high schooler being like let me ask about how to like build a gun and of course like you don't want to teach children or anyone how to build weapons um if the point is education so let's just talk about the history of guns right um that's the naval warfare strategy in the iron age because that's a real thing um bronze age migration into england i watched a really cool documentary about that um let's see uh why does fire emit light and heat so this one's personal to me because when i was like four years old i was asking the adults why does fire glow and they're like because it's emitting energy and i was like but why why does why does why does it emit heat and light and no one could tell me that it's because the electrons are changing levels so like younger younger dave i'm gu i got you we're gonna have a chatbot that can answer all your questions um so story time while i'm coming up with some topics i have a bunch of friends who are they work with um well a couple of friends who work with um asd children autistic spectrum disorder children and uh one thing that that uh some asd is different for everyone but some ask endless questions and my girlfriend um has some experience with this too and um like you've you might have heard stories that like alexa is super popular with um some asd children because she is infinitely patient and will answer all of their questions um so like i'm not saying that this chat bot should be used for that just saying it could be this is a use case um and if you're a hyper curious child like i was perfect okay back to the task at hand um all right imaginary audience talk to me through space and time what are some topics you want to hear um let's see uh uh pastel color palettes sure that just popped into my head is that how you spell palettes um make sure i'm spelling this right color palettes gpt3 is usually pretty forgiving like it'll it'll understand the um the intent even if you misspell something or use the wrong word but if you one thing that i've noticed is that with gpt3 if you use the wrong word its response is likely to copy your style and also use the wrong words uh it's really interesting um okay pastel color palette um let's just do color theory in general uh color theory like why um oh this was a good question so james webb space telescope just just launched and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Hey everybody, David Shapiro here with a brand new video. In this video, I'm going to be creating an educational chat bot using the GPT-3 machine learning platform.

Basically, what I'm going to do is take the prompt from my previous video, "The Companion Chat Bot," and adapt it for educational purposes. So, the new prompt will be something like:

"Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a student. The tutor is Tim, who uses [INSERT NAME OF FORMAL TEACHING TECHNIQUE HERE]. Tim maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is [TOPIC]."

Some possible topics for the conversation could be: history of Rome, mitochondria, dinosaurs, the naval warfare strategy in the iron age, bronze age migration into England, or why fire emits light and heat.

So, that's the plan! I'm going to use the GPT-3 platform to generate a chat bot that can hold a conversation on any of these topics. Wish me luck!
