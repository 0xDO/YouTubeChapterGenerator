0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:13:07.120,0:13:12.480
basically the fine-tuning data will be the story
so far or first the premise so it knows where the
0:13:12.480,0:13:18.640
story is going um so it'll be the premise like
the outline okay outline's probably better so top
0:13:18.640,0:13:24.000
of the input will be outline then it will be the
story so far so like a summary of what's happened
0:13:24.000,0:13:28.960
and then the paragraph you know the last paragraph
and then the output will be the next paragraph
0:13:28.960,0:13:35.680
so what that'll look like is so this is this
is the fine tuning data so prompt um actually
0:13:35.680,0:13:42.240
here i'll do input input prompt so this is
this is what it'll look like so it'll be um
0:13:43.680,0:13:53.280
um story outline and it'll be outline so this
will probably be like a numbered numbered list uh
0:13:53.280,0:14:02.880
story outline and then um story so far actually
summary so far like where in the story we are
0:14:03.520,0:14:12.960
uh maybe like where are we in the story
and that'll be um summary of where we are
0:14:14.080,0:14:19.840
and then um last chunk so this
will be like last paragraphs
0:14:23.040,0:14:29.840
and then next chunk and then this will
be the end and then so this will be
0:14:30.400,0:14:36.560
i'll just do end and so that's this this chunk
here i was going to point out it on the screen
0:14:36.560,0:14:42.240
you can't see my hand so i highlight it this
chunk here will be the input and then the output
0:14:43.440,0:14:58.720
so output slash completion will be um just you
know next paragraph paragraph or two of the story
0:14:59.280,0:15:04.960
so basically let's see if we can train it
to spit out one section of a story at a time
0:15:05.840,0:15:10.160
i doubt it'll work but i think it'll be a cool
experiment all right i'm gonna pause the video
0:15:10.160,0:15:15.360
because this is a lot of tweaking and stuff and
also i'm recording at 60fps which means it will um
0:15:16.240,0:15:19.200
it'll blow up the file size and i don't
care i don't care to do that so i'm going
0:15:19.200,0:15:22.880
to pause the recording and come back when
i've got this split up i'm just going to
0:15:22.880,0:15:27.200
write a couple scripts that'll basically do
this data prep and then i'll be right back
