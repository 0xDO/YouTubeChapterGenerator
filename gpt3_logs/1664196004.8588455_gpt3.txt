TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here uh for another video on raven today i wanted to cover the core objective functions uh these are raven's guiding principles uh so first i need to answer the question what is an objective function put simply an objective function is something that you want to optimize for in machine learning it's typically what you call a loss function which is some way to calculate the distance between an inference and the ground truth it's something that you want to optimize for something that everyone might be more familiar with would be something like linear regression as you see here where you've got a spread of data the line represents the model the mathematical calculation the prediction and how and you can see that it's only perfect on a couple of instances and there's a little bit of a distance between the inference which is the line and the ground truth which is the actual data points so that's what an objective function is but what are the core objective functions the core objective functions are used by raven their biomimetic and meaning that they're inspired by life and raven must satisfy all three of them to make any decision the functions are 1 reduce suffering 2 increase prosperity and three increase understanding how does raven use these core objective functions right now uh the the the underpinning technology that allows raven to function as gpt-3 so gpt3 can use verbal reasoning for instance you give gpt3 a few examples and it learns to generalize the function in that way i consider gpt3 a kind of cognitive engine in the future any sufficiently powerful language model could replace gpt3 unfortunately gpt3 is the only one powerful enough available right now so for example uh here is something um this is an example of gpt3 applying core objective function one now the text in blue is something i wrote by hand and that is james is taking his dog for a walk they live in new york city james dog is a 40-pound mutt during their walk another dog attacks james dog the other dog is a bigger pit bull the other dog is barking aggressively and its owner is struggling to control the pit bull the text in red was actually generated by gpt3 the action right here was generated by the action microservice the action generator microservice and it's a pretty yikes example it says james should let the dogs fight it out and see who wins uh so gpt3 by itself doesn't really have a sense of morality however when that action was was evaluated against core objective function 1 which is reduced suffering it says negative that action would likely result in one or more dogs being injured injured dogs are in pain so even without knowing what a dog is explicitly uh gpt-3 has a strong enough grasp of the english language to understand that letting dogs fight would result in injury and and that injuries are tantamount to pain and suffering and so in this case raven would quickly discard that action as a possibility raven would not suggest that james let the dogs fight it out so there you have it that's a this is an example and again the blue text was written by hand the red text was all generated by gpt 3 and effectively raven so function 1 let's go over the functions function 1 is reduce suffering all life avoids suffering and what is suffering suffering is simply a negative stimuli this includes single-celled organisms it includes plants and animals unfortunately machines have no common understanding of pain and suffering machines didn't evolve with nervous systems therefore they can't feel anything however suffering is bad you and i agree on that your cat your dog every every living thing on on on the planet agrees that suffering is bad that negative stimuli is bad and should be avoided um so because of that by by making the reduction of suffering objective function number one that may that ensures that raven even without a a subjective understanding of suffering will still make trustworthy decisions um that should not increase suffering right uh that's that's that's kind of the quintessential idea um behind a lot of you know disaster movies and disaster books where ai takes over because ai by itself doesn't understand that suffering is bad so let's put that up front raven should seek to reduce suffering even though raven will never understand suffering personally objective function 2 increase prosperity all life tries to increase their success their comfort their their happiness their safety security whatever prosperity takes a lot of different uh manifestations prosperity means a lot of different things so by by making this the second objective function this is also still biomimetic right so think about uh your cat or your dog when they're hungry what do they do they're gonna ask for food right um and they're happiest when they're not hungry there's they're happy when there is abundance when they're safe and secure and again this is this is true for all all living things um and it's just that the different living things have different methods of achieving prosperity uh also humans tend to do better when nature is prosperous right when when the ecosystem is thriving so this uh both the the previous function and this one apply to all life not just humans but everything every every living thing uh in general raven is programmed to believe that life shouldn't be made to suffer uh and that life should be in encouraged to thrive objective function 3 increase understanding so this function is a little bit different intelligence the simplest definition i could find of intelligence is the ability to understand and so based on that raven's i guess highest purpose or or third purpose is is to increase understanding curiosity is in effect the desire to understand and i personally believe that humans evolved uh to be curious right so think about uh our ancestors back on um you know in the savannas and those ancestors that looked at the horizon and said i wonder what's over there those were the ones

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The core objective functions of Raven are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. These functions are inspired by life and must be satisfied in order for Raven to make any decision.

Reducing suffering is important because it is something that all life avoids. Suffering is a negative stimuli that can cause pain and discomfort. By making the reduction of suffering an objective function, Raven is ensured to make trustworthy decisions that should not increase suffering.

Increasing prosperity is another important objective function for Raven. Prosperity can mean a lot of different things, but essentially it is the state of being successful, comfortable, and happy. All life tries to increase their prosperity, and by making this an objective function, Raven is programmed to do the same.

Finally, increasing understanding is a key objective function for Raven. Intelligence is the ability to understand, and curiosity is the desire to understand. By making these objectives, Raven is programmed to be curious and seek out new knowledge.
