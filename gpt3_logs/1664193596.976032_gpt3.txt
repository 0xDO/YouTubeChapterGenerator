TRANSCRIPT: internal activities such as daydreaming mind wandering and self-referential thought so there it is self-ref like if you're thinking about yourself if you're not doing anything and you're just like who am i that's what i mean some researchers have also suggested that the dmn may be involved in memory consolidation and retrieval could be recent studies have shown that the dmn is highly active in people with depression and anxiety hyper self-awareness this has led some researchers to speculate that dmn may be involved in the development of these disorders it should also be noted that things like meditation and psychedelic therapy or therapy in general um modify the dmn um that is an active area of research so like if you if you do deep meditation or cbt or psychedelic psychotherapy your dmn chain changes um let's see okay tasks that embedding intuition heuristics recall so let's do recall in neuroscience okay recall refers to the neurocognitive process of retrieving information from memory when we recall something we are accessing memories that are stored in our long-term memory oh let's wait for it to finish okay it's actually not done here let me increase the length it says hey buddy we're not done this might be too long okay uh let's see where were we we're access when we recall something we are accessing memories that are stored in our long-term memory so long-term memory is roughly i'm not going to say equivalent but it's approximately similar to embedding in gpt3 so embedding we'll get to that actually gpt3 might not be able to give a good definition of embedding because it's a newer term where it's going to have more neuroscience but anyways bookmark that we'll talk about embedding in a second so basically long-term memory is similar to embedding recall can be prompted by internal or external cues internal cues include things like our current mood or the time of day external cues can be anything from our from our environment that reminds us of something from the past so um this idea of internal and external cueing i talk about this in my book um but basically like your brain is always searching for memphis related memories always completely unconscious all the time recall is a basic cognitive function that is essential for everyday life without the ability to recall memories we would be unable to learn from our past experiences or make plans for the future recall is also important for our mental well-being when we recall happy memories we can boost our mood and increase our satisfaction okay that's uh well here free recall is when we try to remember something without any cues that can be more difficult cued recall this is when we use external cues to help us remember information and serial recall this is when we try and remember a sequence of information such as a list of items okay that's i think that's plenty for that let's do embedding and this is going to be um artificial neural networks so let's see if it can give us a good definition yeah this is just going to give us a definition of of artificial neural networks okay so i'm gonna have to improvise here so when when a fact or task is put is is known by a neural network such as a large language model like gpt3 you say that it's embedded meaning that that information that task that problem is is is in the network somewhere it's a distributed diffuse network of nodes that will activate in order to achieve that particular task so all the text that gpt3 has been trained on that is embedded information but if if there's information that you need that's not embedded you have to put it in the working memory and the working memory is the size of this prompt right and the limit for this for this is 4 000 tokens so 4 000 tokens is probably about like i don't know 16 000 characters maybe they're about i don't know um so but basically four thousand words um so the working memory of gpt3 right now is four thousand words um you can refer to stuff that is embedded so one thing that i learned early on is that if you're trying to do a task you can assume that gbt3 understands what you're talking about like you don't need to define it every time um because obviously i'm just asking it to like define these things so it has you know all these concepts embedded right it has task set embedded it has um prefrontal cortex embedded it has all kinds of stuff embedded so you just need to prompt it to to recall those so remember we just defined recall so gpt3 can instantly recall billions of concepts that's where it's magical it's lack of task set it's lack of working memory that's where it's not magical and we have to compensate for for those deficits with cognitive architectures okay um intuition yeah let's do that intuition so intuition is like is like a combination of recall and and uh and processing at once so let's say intuition in neuroscience the scientific study of intuition is a relatively new field but researchers have already made significant progress in understanding how it works essentially intuition is a form of pattern recognition that allows us to make quick often unconscious uh decisions based on limited information yes so we rapidly so remember recall we we recall something like this one event reminds me of something from my past so i'll just leap to a conclusion and that's also called a heuristic intuition is thought to be mediated by a network of regions in the brain including the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system the prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher level thinking and decision making while the limbic system is responsible for emotional processing together these regions allow us to quickly assess a situation and make a decision based on our previous experiences this is very similar to heuristics studies have shown that intuition is often more accurate than conscious reasoning although it is more likely to lead to errors when the situation is complex or unfamiliar so this is where heuristics come in because the more

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Studies show that the prefrontal cortex and limbic system work together to allow us to quickly assess a situation and make a decision based on our previous experiences. This is what is known as intuition. Intuition is a form of pattern recognition that allows us to make quick decisions based on limited information. Intuition is thought to be mediated by a network of regions in the brain, including the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher-level thinking and decision making, while the limbic system is responsible for emotional processing. Together, these regions allow us to quickly assess a situation and make a decision based on our previous experiences. Although intuition is often more accurate than conscious reasoning, it is more likely to lead to errors when the situation is complex or unfamiliar.
