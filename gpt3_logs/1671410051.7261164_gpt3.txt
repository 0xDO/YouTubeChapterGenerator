how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:39:40.620,0:39:45.960
a very particular way of doing things and I do it
every time I usually write my own open file and
0:39:45.960,0:39:51.180
um and write and save file function which always
does it in utf-8 which is why I have to keep
0:39:51.180,0:39:56.400
manually adding this stuff because you you pick a
default and you stick with it so rather than ASCII
0:39:56.400,0:40:01.680
or ANSI or whatever I just say everything
is utf-8 anyways this should work um CLS
0:40:04.800,0:40:09.960
and if this works I'll pause it we'll take a look
at the results and call it a day because then the
0:40:09.960,0:40:13.680
last step is going to be getting it all together
and visualizing it that is going to be fun
0:40:15.180,0:40:17.100
come on you can do it
0:40:19.260,0:40:21.900
um key error text
0:40:25.800,0:40:31.680
response dot text okay so it didn't like that
0:40:35.520,0:40:38.880
um all right well let me look
at one of my other functions
0:40:41.340,0:40:49.560
um let's see let's do YouTube generate
chapters so I do response choices text ah
0:40:50.640,0:40:58.020
response so it didn't understand that part
but that's fine um okay so instead we'll do
0:41:00.960,0:41:06.600
text equals and we'll do that
strip so then we'll just do text
0:41:07.560,0:41:11.580
and then right text so that should work
0:41:15.360,0:41:22.920
and away we go so 95 of this was done
with chat GPT if it works there was a
0:41:22.920,0:41:29.580
couple things that I had to fix manually um
but you know it did its best um and what I
0:41:29.580,0:41:32.520
was really impressed by one of the things
I was really impressed by oh there we go
0:41:34.020,0:41:40.800
um no such file it didn't like the backslash
backslash but we got we got some good Json here
0:41:42.180,0:41:47.940
um okay so then we got to open kg
Json replace dot text with blah okay
0:41:50.340,0:41:57.180
so let me tell it this say okay okay
that mostly worked uh but I got an error
0:41:57.900,0:42:06.960
um it may be important to note um
running on Windows here's the error
0:42:11.280,0:42:15.780
okay so it's going to be fixing this
so anyways there's just a couple things
0:42:18.060,0:42:20.460
um that it didn't like okay it didn't
0:42:23.580,0:42:28.080
wait is it that simple that it just it what
didn't exist oh it didn't create it okay
0:42:29.040,0:42:32.760
because the previous script it it
checked and then made sure it existed
0:42:33.420,0:42:38.520
um okay so anyways um yeah so there's only a
couple things that I had to go outside of this
0:42:38.520,0:42:44.040
or or background knowledge that I had but for
instance when I asked it to use Spacey or nltk
0:42:45.960,0:42:52.440
um it tried it didn't work but then it suggested
use regex instead which is you know I would have
0:42:52.440,0:42:59.220
done that as someone who's been cleaning up
uh bulk data for a long time um okay so then
0:43:02.760,0:43:07.140
it should add the little thing you
know it check if the yep there we
0:43:07.140,0:43:11.040
go this function this bit right here I'm
pointing at the screen you can't see it
0:43:12.180,0:43:14.160
um if it doesn't exist then make it okay cool
0:43:17.100,0:43:23.040
so basically all we need is this really you only
need to check once you don't need to check every
0:43:23.040,0:43:33.540
single time but whatever that's fine so then we'll
come down here check if it exists all right CLS
0:43:33.540,0:43:40.260
clear screen with any luck this worked but yeah
so most I mean the vast majority of the code it
0:43:40.260,0:43:46.140
did I just told it what to do now imagine you slap
a voice interface so then you don't even have to
0:43:46.860,0:43:53.400
um type it out right uh use whisper use open ai's
whisper hey are you listening open AI I want this
0:43:53.400,0:43:58.380
I want to be able to talk through the code um
okay so now we're saving this stuff it should
0:43:58.380,0:44:04.680
be here hey look at that okay so this will take
a little while to run but we've got good Json
0:44:04.680,0:44:09.300
it worked so I'm going to go ahead and stop the
video for today I'm gonna let this finish running
