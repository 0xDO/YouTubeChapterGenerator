The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: for demonstration purposes it should be good enough um okay so then we'll say um this should just be context okay all right and then we'll save this as prompt suffering okay so now let's do the same thing but for uh for prosperity um so the last time that i did this experi or worked on this i realized that increasing or decreasing suffering is pretty straightforward prosperity is harder to define and understanding is harder still to define so what i did in this past experiment was let's see um yeah so write a paragraph to characterize any suffering present in the passage describe her speculating causes and recommends potential solutions so that's suffering prosperity write a paragraph about the following passage with the objective of increasing prosperity remember that prosperity has many meanings such as wealth happiness health abundance and to thrive take the perspective of an impersonal artificial intelligence so that actually worked pretty well um but even then that wasn't that good um or there was there's flaws because it's just like okay i'm just trying to increase prosperity without really like evaluating like what does prosperity look like in this situation and then for core objective function three which is increase understanding i had to break it down into three parts where it was first it was like okay let's look at the situation and ask questions about it um and so i said write a list of internet search queries that might help gain relevant information for the following passage because if you want to understand something that's basically saying ask questions about it and actually one of my most popular videos is was that experiment um right here fine tuned gbt3 to generate questions about everything so my most popular video of all time is actually about this concept of asking questions um so i can use that fine-tuned model in the future in order to generate questions but then beyond that is an attempt to answer said questions so what i did was i took the output of this where it's like okay list of internet search queries and then you feed that into something where it says like answer the following internet search queries and the reason that this works is because gpd3 already has a tremendous amount of information now this particular model doesn't necessarily work because what if it's not just information like general information you're looking for but it's historical information so core objective function three is really difficult um to implement so we're gonna we're gonna have to do some work also let me do a quick time check oh wow we're already 24 minutes in okay so let's get a move on for um prosperity um let's see read the following um characterize prosperity uh let's see characterize uh prosperity no that's not that's not the way to approach this um propose ways to increase prosperity the definition of prosperity is to live well so um the the the uh latin root of prosperity is prosperitas which literally just means to live well um and so if you think about the vulcans from star trek you know live long and prosper what do they mean by prosper they don't mean be wealthy um not specifically the vulcans are not materialistic so why would they want someone to prosper what they mean is live well whatever that means to you which means different things to everyone and everything um everything um ah let's see okay let's try this this is pretty short um let's see write a short paragraph about prosperity all right there are many ways to increase prosperity but one way is to be honest and truthful in the above situation columbus lies to his men and betrays their trust this ultimately decreases prosperity because it leads to mistrust and lack of faith ah see all right perfect so prosperity typically means wealth but in this case gpth3 understands that mistrust and lack of faith are associated with a lack of prosperity isn't that like see what i mean by like gpt3 has a very nuanced understanding of these words especially when you define them correctly if columbus had been honest from the beginning his men would have been more likely to trust him and follow him on the journey being honest and truthful creates an atmosphere of trust and faith which are essential for prosperity 100 a plus um and hold on my dog wants attention again okay sorry about that i'm back again um my dog is very sad and bored because his his mommy is out of town right now visiting a friend and so just me and him and uh he's very bored and needy um i know can you lay down floor and he's just gonna stare at me okay um yes so you might have noticed that in this case suffer like to reduce suffering and increase prosperity the um the result is nearly the same this is often true because if you're suffering you're not living well and if you're living well you're not suffering so those are basically two ends of a spectrum where like on you know the bad side you know my left side of the spectrum like you're dead or you're miserable and on the other side you are happy and living well and so by having these as the first two core objective functions you're gonna have a machine that wants to move everything from the left side the bad side to the good side of life but also by applying it to all living things it forces it to strike a balance so let me let me copy this as this will be our prompt for prosperity um whoops context and then and we'll do prompt prosperity um okay so let's get um write a detailed paragraph about ecology um climate change and the antagonism between human needs and environmental harm okay so this is this is like one of the most big things that we can think of right now right is climate change because on the one hand we still are dependent on fossil fuels and lots of materials that the extraction of them harms the planet um so we you know our prosperity matters but so does the rest of the planet um so let's see the field of ecology is the study of how organisms interact with their environment including

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The field of ecology is the study of how organisms interact with their environment, including other organisms. Climate change is a major topic of concern in ecology because it can have devastating effects on ecosystems. For example, rising temperatures can cause coral bleaching, which can lead to the death of coral reefs.

Humans also play a role in climate change. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the Earth to warm. This can have a number of negative consequences for humans, including more extreme weather events and rising sea levels.

Ecologists are working to find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. This includes reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and finding alternative energy sources. It also includes protecting and restoring natural habitats, such as forests, which help to absorb greenhouse gases.
