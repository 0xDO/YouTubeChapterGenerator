0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:26:27.360,1:26:33.720
law for this sort of it's a constitution and
to change this uh you have to apply this rule
1:26:33.720,1:26:38.640
itself so only with the approval of the dictator
you can change the rule that he is the dictator
1:26:40.020,1:26:45.180
that's if that gets approved in the first place
yes yes indeed but it might not ever get approved
1:26:45.180,1:26:51.480
so that's why I also conceive that there may
be branches different realities of Tau that the
1:26:51.480,1:26:55.320
one which has a dictatorship or some something
like countries right people that create their
1:26:55.320,1:27:01.020
own majority religious subgroups that create a
religious reality or whatever right so that's also
1:27:01.020,1:27:08.520
interesting I guess um so you what you're saying
is that that could be a a smaller implementation
1:27:08.520,1:27:17.280
or an isolated Tau Network might end up with that
set of rules okay now but what if so here's here's
1:27:17.280,1:27:26.820
where I after learning about this and I was just
thinking about it um what if what if Tau ends
1:27:26.820,1:27:33.480
up much broader like across entire nations
or continents or or Global is that is that
1:27:33.480,1:27:38.280
part of the vision is that part of the dream where
everyone is interacting with the same town Network
1:27:38.280,1:27:44.460
and it becomes collectively more intelligent
and and and has the knowledge and capabilities
1:27:44.460,1:27:49.260
of all humans across the whole planet is that
is that part of the dream because that's that's
1:27:49.260,1:27:54.000
to me that's that's where my imagination goes
with the technology that you guys have outlined
1:27:58.140,1:28:07.980
well I believe that anyone should have a
significant voice and in Tao is indeed a voice
1:28:07.980,1:28:13.440
amplifier and you may ask well if you amplify
everyone's voice then what's the point then you
1:28:13.440,1:28:20.100
remain with the noise but when it does the magic
of amplifying all voices without having the noise
1:28:22.320,1:28:29.640
and I personally yes I want to see everyone
saying their opinion in society takes everyone
1:28:29.640,1:28:38.340
into account whether governments want that
or will go this direction I don't know
1:28:40.320,1:28:45.540
right it wouldn't even have to be like I guess
a government could adopt it right like one one
1:28:45.540,1:28:51.360
early step and I've discussed this concept with
other folks is using using Dao's distributed
1:28:51.360,1:28:56.820
autonomous organizations or like townships or
homeowners associations that could be a first step
1:28:57.420,1:29:01.500
um but yeah it wouldn't necessarily need
to be adopted by governments but if it's
1:29:01.500,1:29:09.240
if it's if it's by voluntary participation
right if if I can decide to set up a town
1:29:09.240,1:29:14.100
node on my phone and then I'm participating
in the town Network it's almost like nobody
1:29:14.100,1:29:19.020
could stop it either is that is that a
possible possible future is is that's
1:29:19.020,1:29:23.040
one of the the natures the robust Natures of
blockchain is that it's difficult to turn off
1:29:25.620,1:29:33.240
yes just like the the most evolutionary thing
ever happened in history is the internet
1:29:35.820,1:29:39.360
and indeed people say what they
say in the internet they try to
1:29:39.360,1:29:41.460
stop it yes we now we have a lot of censorship
1:29:42.480,1:29:49.740
but people still to a large extent able to say
what they have to say although it is propagated
1:29:49.740,1:29:55.800
only for people who read them there is a limit
to how many people you can read every day um
1:29:57.240,1:30:03.120
you are going to see a summarized
map of what everyone says
1:30:05.520,1:30:08.220
because it can be that two
people have three opinions
1:30:08.940,1:30:15.120
but in a million people they will not be a
million opinions there will be a lot of overlap um
1:30:17.400,1:30:23.280
so you can you can Aggregate and summarize
and cluster not just people as a whole but
1:30:23.280,1:30:27.360
but their opinions and so it says you
overlap with this group over here and
1:30:27.360,1:30:31.080
and that's part of that finding
consensus or finding agreement
1:30:31.080,1:30:40.140
in arbitrarily large populations this
is what we call the opinion map shows
1:30:43.740,1:30:48.000
so you can think about the Twitter
feed or Facebook feed they look like
