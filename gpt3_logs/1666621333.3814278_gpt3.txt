0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:13:10.320,1:13:20.280
and then um suppose after you expressed a lot of
opinions now your Tau client knows what you want
1:13:22.500,1:13:25.380
and knows ways to achieve what you want
1:13:26.400,1:13:32.340
can automatically organize stuff as long
as the staff live in the computer world
1:13:34.860,1:13:40.680
to give you what you want whether
it is Taylor for me a good deal
1:13:41.580,1:13:49.920
that takes into account my abilities my skills
my assets and other people bids and so on
1:13:51.060,1:13:55.140
or how the how Society should be like
1:13:59.760,1:14:03.780
and so long well you cannot just go to
Google and tell Google give me what I want
1:14:04.620,1:14:08.280
but you will be able to go to Tao
and tell it give me what I want
1:14:11.220,1:14:19.020
so this this is why when I when I got this
in our earlier conversations it it completely
1:14:19.860,1:14:26.340
blew my mind because for me the difficulty
was connecting okay formal logic software
1:14:26.340,1:14:32.460
specifications natural language but what you're
saying is once you have that full stack all those
1:14:32.460,1:14:37.140
layers of abstraction and and then because it's
not just it's not just an individual it's not
1:14:37.140,1:14:43.980
just me talking to Tao and it and it deriving um
specifications from my words but it's also doing
1:14:43.980,1:14:50.160
the same thing for everyone who's participating in
Tau and finding those points of agreement and then
1:14:50.160,1:14:57.540
it's allowing the Tau Network to update itself
automatically and so everyone who participates
1:14:57.540,1:15:01.800
in a tel Network and we'll talk a little bit about
how that's going to be implemented and deployed in
1:15:01.800,1:15:07.740
just a moment but I just want to reiterate for
our audience this is this is this is the key
1:15:08.520,1:15:14.880
um Innovation here where by interacting with with
your Tau client and as I mentioned we'll get into
1:15:14.880,1:15:20.460
the implementation and deployment in a moment but
by interacting with the Tau client over time time
1:15:20.460,1:15:26.580
it will learn what you want what you need and
it's all recorded based on those expressions
1:15:26.580,1:15:33.240
of opinions and needs through from our natural
language correct um so it will take that and then
1:15:33.240,1:15:38.940
for uh translate it into the controlled language
and then further and further abstract it down into
1:15:38.940,1:15:45.360
formal logic and specifications but then everyone
who's participating in Tau will do the same thing
1:15:45.360,1:15:52.560
and as you mentioned everyone's ideas and needs
and requirements and and knowledge will become
1:15:52.560,1:15:59.340
embedded in the whole Tau Network and that means
that the town network will be as intelligent as
1:15:59.340,1:16:06.480
everyone participating in it but not just as as as
individuals it will record those ideas abilities
1:16:06.480,1:16:13.260
in any new capabilities of the network over time
and it will continue to get smarter is that a good
1:16:13.260,1:16:21.360
summary of kind of how the Tau network is alive
in in some respects yes just with one kevia I
1:16:21.360,1:16:27.840
don't want the audience to think that you're going
to give a natural language sentence and it will
1:16:27.840,1:16:33.780
understand you and that's it for natural language
to formal language it will be an interactive
1:16:33.780,1:16:40.080
process but the user will have to eventually
approve the formal statement but other than
1:16:40.080,1:16:48.000
that yes that's where the system is heading to in
the long term yes excellent and so how does this
1:16:50.220,1:16:57.000
help me help me explain to our our audience
because I have I have an idea in my head of
1:16:57.000,1:17:03.480
what this Collective Network intelligence has
because it's it's it forms a layer not just for
1:17:03.480,1:17:09.720
machines to communicate like you know with with a
blockchain right blockchain is is is how machines
1:17:09.720,1:17:15.660
can can work together uh maintain consensus
but this also allows for humans to communicate
1:17:16.260,1:17:20.580
uh seamlessly not just with each
other but also with the machine layer
1:17:21.300,1:17:27.360
and then ultimately what are the kinds of things
that the Tau Network can be endowed with what are
1:17:27.360,1:17:34.080
the abilities or capabilities or the extensibility
of the Tau Network like you know okay like we
1:17:34.080,1:17:39.540
talked about like Google Maps and stuff but that's
that's not even the beginning of what we what what
