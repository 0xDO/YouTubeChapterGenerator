how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.800,0:00:07.200
hey everybody david shapiro here with uh part
two of my getting started with python and gpt3
0:00:07.200,0:00:13.360
from scratch video series uh before we get started
please go ahead and like and subscribe this video
0:00:13.360,0:00:18.160
uh that will help me work towards getting
monetized on youtube which who knows maybe
0:00:18.160,0:00:23.840
one day i'll be able to do this full time but
also if you like uh my videos my content you
0:00:23.840,0:00:28.640
find them helpful please consider hopping over
to my patreon link in the description or comments
0:00:29.680,0:00:36.320
and consider supporting me directly that will
go much further towards helping me to do this
0:00:36.320,0:00:42.800
full-time you see how i churn out content i'm
happy to keep doing this and the more support i
0:00:42.800,0:00:49.040
get the better it'll be so without further ado
let's jump back over to our uh our project our
0:00:49.040,0:00:57.920
learning so this is our repo this is where we left
off we did a hello world um a read me and and so
0:00:57.920,0:01:05.920
on and so forth now what i've done is i added
a i added git ignore and what git ignore does
0:01:06.560,0:01:14.560
is i've added open ai api key because last time
i said whatever you do don't ever store your
0:01:14.560,0:01:21.040
api key publicly or in a git repo and so what git
ignore does and this is what it looks like locally
0:01:21.600,0:01:28.720
is it tells git to ignore that um you can do
directories you can do wild cards as well so you
0:01:28.720,0:01:36.160
could do like star.json to ignore all json files
that's fine so but if i look in my repo my key
0:01:36.160,0:01:44.000
is here so you should have last time you should
have created this text file and populated it and
0:01:44.960,0:01:48.720
get in and get your hello world to work
so let's take a quick look at hello world
0:01:49.840,0:01:56.640
um all this does is opens a file sets the api or
at first we declare a function that opens the file
0:01:56.640,0:02:03.120
reads it and returns um that file contents and
then we have a function that will do a davinci
0:02:03.120,0:02:10.160
completion um and then we will we'll we get we
pass it a prompt that says write a list of famous
0:02:10.160,0:02:15.440
american actors we get the response from gpd3 and
then we print it out so i'm assuming you did your
