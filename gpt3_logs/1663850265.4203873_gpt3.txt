how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.420,0:00:06.180
hey everybody David Shapiro here um
yeah so I was really excited to work on
0:00:07.200,0:00:15.420
um earlier I was working on my novel writer and
I had uh from a previous experiment I had uh 200
0:00:15.420,0:00:21.840
different premises and I was like okay that's
good but uh we can do better so I was talking to
0:00:21.840,0:00:29.100
my fiance who is um a librarian by training and an
Avid Reader and so she sent me this document which
0:00:29.100,0:00:39.240
has a list of all kinds of appeal terms and then
what I did was I went to um I went to Wikipedia
0:00:40.140,0:00:46.800
and then I also went to TV tropes
and I got lists upon lists of genres
0:00:48.420,0:00:54.180
um so I took all that together and I made
a bunch of files so we've got uh character
0:00:54.180,0:01:01.680
types we've got genres we've got 192 genres
three different Paces um I did 31 settings
0:01:03.240,0:01:13.020
um I did 11 storyline types 24 Styles
39 time periods 53 tones and so you
0:01:13.020,0:01:18.420
multiply all that together and we have 292
billion different combinations for stories
0:01:19.800,0:01:26.820
um I wanted to make sure I got every possible type
of story now this excludes um video games and a
0:01:26.820,0:01:33.420
few other things but uh yeah so this is a lot so
we can get we can get most story lines in here
0:01:34.140,0:01:39.720
um and then I stuffed it all into a prompt so
brainstorm an extremely long complete detailed
0:01:39.720,0:01:45.120
synopsis for a story with the following appeal
terms genre setting time period story type Pace
0:01:45.120,0:01:51.540
character tone style so this should cover
all of literary literature and film and TV
0:01:52.560,0:01:59.580
um but uh well most of it um extremely long
and highly detailed complete plot synopsis
0:01:59.580,0:02:06.600
with beginning middle and end okay so I got that
and then I generated um I've generated more than
0:02:06.600,0:02:10.440
this but these are these are the the current
ones that are that are pretty good and so what
0:02:10.440,0:02:15.840
I did was I stuff it all so you get all the appeal
terms right at the top and then here's the story
0:02:17.280,0:02:22.260
um you know appeal term swashbuckler in
Australia in the 21st century believable
