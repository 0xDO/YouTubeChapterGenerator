0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:38:11.220,0:38:18.480
gpd3 was trained on internet data which means it
has already read a lot of real human um uh real
0:38:18.480,0:38:23.520
human opinions and that is actually the point
of having the story right because you it reads
0:38:23.520,0:38:28.320
someone's story and it'll cue up all of those
embeddings about people like that that it has
0:38:28.320,0:38:36.660
already read about and so we're getting somewhat
accurate-ish representations of what someone
0:38:36.660,0:38:42.900
might actually want or think obviously I'm using
the instruct models and so it's already kind of
0:38:44.100,0:38:50.220
it's already biased towards a particular data set
which is not ideal but if I fine-tune the base
0:38:50.220,0:38:58.020
model base DaVinci we'll get rid of that anyways
okay so I think we've got those three prompts
0:38:59.340,0:39:03.240
um yeah so I'll pause it again and I'll
make a third script that will take those
0:39:03.240,0:39:08.880
stories and this this topic um actually
I've got it here the generate responses
0:39:08.880,0:39:14.160
so I'll just finish fleshing this out
and it will save everyone's opinions
0:39:14.160,0:39:18.780
and we'll be right back and we'll call
it a day because we are at 40 minutes
0:39:20.520,0:39:29.760
okay so we are running this let me show you
the script real quick so it's just very simple
0:39:30.540,0:39:35.580
um runs those three prompts in serial where
it gets someone's feelings their concerns and
0:39:35.580,0:39:43.740
then asks for compromises um so this is a very
shorthand form of um of consensus and then it
0:39:43.740,0:39:52.140
saves it out to World Views so we've got we at
the start of someone's world view is structured
0:39:52.140,0:40:00.840
information where it has um their story uh so like
this is kind of like this is who the person is
0:40:01.920,0:40:10.020
um and then here are you know there's um the
world view is a list of responses to topics so
0:40:10.020,0:40:14.400
there's a topic and then how they feel about it
and the concerns and then the compromises that
0:40:14.400,0:40:20.160
they want to do and so what we'll do is in the
future when I come back to this I'll take all of
0:40:20.160,0:40:25.020
this information and I'll run this for a few more
people the reason I'm only doing it on 10 people
0:40:25.020,0:40:28.800
is because I don't want to burn through tokens
while just testing to make sure that the thing
0:40:28.800,0:40:35.520
is valid but really ultimately like I want to
do this for you know tens of thousands of people
0:40:36.900,0:40:43.140
um because then you can really get get creative
and what we're doing is we're provoking a lot
0:40:43.140,0:40:52.320
of creativity from the machine um so yeah uh
there we go um I think that's about it I'll just
0:40:52.320,0:40:58.320
let this finish um but we'll call it a day and
we've got a system now that is taking someone's
0:40:59.340,0:41:06.180
um you know their life story and using that
to uh to generate their position and so what
0:41:06.180,0:41:12.240
we'll do is we have a lot of data and so then
the next thing that we'll do is we will take
0:41:12.240,0:41:17.820
all of these dispositions and we'll try and
find okay what's the common ground can we
0:41:17.820,0:41:23.280
have the machine calculate what is the common
ground that people can agree on and what are
0:41:23.280,0:41:28.020
some Creative Solutions and we'll have a
machine that takes this as the input and
0:41:28.020,0:41:34.260
and as a very clinical thing kind of tries
to come up with Alternatives and proposals
0:41:34.260,0:41:39.480
but yeah thanks for watching I think we'll
call that a day um and uh have a good one
