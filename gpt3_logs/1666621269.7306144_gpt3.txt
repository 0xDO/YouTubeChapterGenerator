0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:52.260,0:04:59.820
history of Tau um let's hit on let's ask the big
question uh for our for our viewers what is the
0:04:59.820,0:05:04.860
what is the general goal is to create this
decentralized network can you guys give us
0:05:04.860,0:05:10.260
a little bit like a high level overview what is
the goal of Tau and and and of decentralization
0:05:11.460,0:05:15.660
um who would anyone who can who would like
to go first uh Professor franconi or Ohio
0:05:17.700,0:05:27.600
hahaha in all existing decentralized networks
there is some big elephant in the room of
0:05:27.600,0:05:32.520
something very centralized everyone somehow
ignores maybe maybe not everyone which is
0:05:33.180,0:05:40.020
the centralized development team how can
we seriously take a decentralized economy
0:05:40.020,0:05:45.300
like I don't know Bitcoin controlled
by a bunch of computer geeks like me
0:05:47.460,0:05:55.620
how can how can it be any wide enough
shoulders to carry the whole the whole world
0:05:57.720,0:06:01.020
the centralized control of the development team
0:06:01.980,0:06:08.040
he's a big bottleneck for adoption and it
is a problem by its own who promises that
0:06:08.580,0:06:12.960
the centralized development team will take
the right economic decisions and indeed they
0:06:12.960,0:06:19.800
themselves know this and therefore they avoid
taking economic decisions I'll give you the
0:06:19.800,0:06:27.060
centralized in a sound way in a constructive
way that how the network itself should be like
0:06:29.760,0:06:30.960
and that's what we do
0:06:33.780,0:06:42.660
so to say that in another way the goal is as you
said um to take control away but not from from
0:06:42.660,0:06:48.120
everyone but to take control away from any
kind of centralization and distribute it to
0:06:48.120,0:06:52.500
everyone who participates in a network and the
example that you gave is like Bitcoin or other
0:06:52.500,0:06:58.560
economic networks so that that way everyone
has a stake in deciding not just what the
0:06:58.560,0:07:04.320
network does or what the organization does but
how it is coded correctly even participating
0:07:04.320,0:07:12.120
in the in the development and building of that
Network true that's height you can look at it
0:07:18.180,0:07:24.840
software is there for one and only one thing
which is the users software is only for the users
0:07:24.840,0:07:34.860
but somehow the users have little to no voice or
influence on how the software should be like next
0:07:34.860,0:07:40.740
time your phones ask to update itself how does
it feel who knows what they put them ah if it
0:07:40.740,0:07:47.400
doesn't feel good but it's all for the users you
are the user why you don't have control over this
0:07:49.200,0:07:56.820
well there are very serious um theoretical
practical social problems associated with it
0:07:57.600,0:08:04.680
you can ask how can a large group of people the
whole audience take any collaborative decision
0:08:04.680,0:08:10.800
whether it's blockchain also for anything
that's a big problem by its own and then
0:08:10.800,0:08:16.560
you have an even bigger problem how can a large
group of people not only take a decision together
0:08:16.560,0:08:21.720
but even have a discussion how can one million
people have a meaningful discussion altogether
0:08:24.240,0:08:31.020
and those are indeed problems that we address upon
the theoretical problems there are some very deep
0:08:31.020,0:08:39.060
theoretical problems here that we can speak about
right and yes in methodological problems and we
0:08:39.060,0:08:45.780
can speak about everything yes yeah so the the
conceptual problems like you said it's it's a
0:08:45.780,0:08:52.080
matter of organization um is is one thing is
for for anyone in the audience who has ever
0:08:52.080,0:08:59.640
participated in any kind of software development
or or any kind of um uh concerted group effort
0:09:00.360,0:09:06.600
um organization becomes intractable once the
group gets too big but with technology platforms
0:09:06.600,0:09:11.640
today that affect everyone to your example
you know everyone uses phones computers uh
0:09:11.640,0:09:17.580
you know whatever you're watching this this video
on today um that has there's a lot of control and
0:09:17.580,0:09:22.200
management that goes into that but then countless
hundreds thousands of developers that go into that
0:09:22.200,0:09:29.280
uh that effort and organizing that is uh not
a solved problem and as you mentioned there's
