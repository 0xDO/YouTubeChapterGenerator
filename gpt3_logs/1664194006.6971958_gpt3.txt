The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: this is the pros and then basically what we're asking it to do is then um so this is great gatsby 07. so let me open great gatsby 07 and the completions um let's see great gatsby 07. and so basically what we are training what we're training gpt3 to do is this so they spent a year blo in france for no particular reason so you see how it just continues it right along um ideally it will be you know like gpt3 will only spit out one whole paragraph at a time but let's see how it goes also let's not save that no um okay all those are all gonna get overwritten anyways before we go uh okay i think we're ready to test let me back up my work um what is this auto muse get status get add git commit am um saving work for part two i know i make the most awful git commits um get push okay save a work so now we've got no risks python is our python prepare json l um sleep is not defined we have insomnia i'm sorry i'm sorry for subjecting you all to myself right now okay actually no i'm not sorry you're watching this on purpose error communicating no api key provided what do you mean i need an api key guys i'm having a rough time of it today okay summarizing the summaries hey look at that so it's still getting too long hmm yeah it's still getting progressively longer interesting because so my rule of thumb my mental rule of thumb is that a gpt3 prompt is limited to about 6000 characters that that tends to be around 2 000 tokens 2048 which is the limit right now so this is not getting summarized accurately um it could be that i'm doing something wrong prompt equals oh that's the problem i'm updating the prompt not the summary chunk the summary chunk needs to be equal to that yeah guys the man okay let's try that again oh also this is not big enough sorry properties font 28 boom okay so now the summary should not get too much oh there we go look so yeah there we go perfect oh there yes yes yes yes summarizing summaries why is it taking so long the first one went by really fast 6 000 characters yep okay it's working it's working and let's see most of them the total length was let's the longest was 6 000 so that should still fit frankenstein is a little bit long 6 000 so that's this is why we wanted to um compact the story premise as much as possible so let me go ahead and axe this because i'm afraid you know if frankenstein is is going to be too long then um certainly pride and prejudice is going to be too long so let's try something else we will go to the prompt for summary summarize this passage very concisely so we're just going to go full send full yolo and summarize these things that are too the length is too damn high um the outlines that's the word words are hard yes okay so frankenstein is presently 2180 characters so let's using a different prompt make it shorter petty to fool okay hmm it looks like it didn't make it any shorter i don't think it worked yeah one for one output i might have to do this manually uh my brain okay what happens if we turn up the temperature like it's seen it's it sees that it's already a concise summary and it's like i can't what do you want me to do it's already super concise this looks like it might be shorter maybe not nope no shorter hmm this is uh this is a tough cookie all right so frankenstein is 21 um great gatsby's 1600. what was it alice in wonderland was like 1300 so we got to get these under like this one's got to be half as long as it is and sherlock is 21. oh man cheese it removed periods it's kind of interesting huh i didn't notice that oh man i'm gonna pause this and think about this for a second because this is this is tough give me just a minute okay gang whoops sorry sorry got a little bit over excited there okay so what we're going to do is we're going to just throw this out and start over so write a short plot synopsis of the great gatsby um there we go so this one is like just a couple hundred characters so that's not so bad so let's just save that because it tells it tells you the whole story and it's pretty concise i tried i tried uh changing the adjective detailed plot and it got real long let me just show you after a lengthy absence nick carraway returns to long island yeah wait the first time i did this it just kept going and going and going oh i've got the temperature too high turn the temperature down ah this looks like yeah known for lavish parties the object of his affection daisy buchanan yeah so here you can see it just keeps going and going and going and going and going and going is basically telling the whole story let's see how long it is though that's 2500 characters yeah okay so we'll stick with 500 characters we'll just see if this works it's short enough um and then we'll do write a short plot synopsis of mary shelley's frankenstein okay yeah because making making those those summaries that i had shorter just wasn't working wasn't working short plot synopsis of um is it jane austen jane austen's pride and prejudice that's the right book right yeah okay and we're down to 600 characters excellent um of arthur conan doyle's sir arthur conan doyle's the adventures of sherlock holmes no tell me the story it's never easy if it were easy someone else would have done it um of okay so now we will go back to here 400 characters 2100 characters okay um there we go and still okay list the names of the short stories in the adventures of sherlock holmes i don't believe you okay write an extremely concise summary of the following passage whoops extremely concise summary this is not working okay maybe sherlock holmes isn't a good example because it is a compendium maybe that's the problem let's go back to gutenberg gutenberg and go to book search most popular a tale of two cities let's do dracula get it in text yeah oh but that means i gotta start over with all the summaries and stuff you know what i'm just gonna we're just gonna do four i'm just gonna cut out sherlock holmes because this one this one is too difficult goodbye sherlock books sherlock
