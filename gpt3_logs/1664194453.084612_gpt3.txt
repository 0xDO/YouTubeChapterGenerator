The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: of gravity so i'm a little disappointed because tim was supposed to use this information um but that's fine [Music] um hmm yeah i'm actually i'm actually kind of not happy about this because gpt3 absolutely should use this information so let's do a little bit of prompt engineering okay so we have this and we say tim should use the hints let's see so let's just say tim is an academic tutor well here the following is a chat log between tim and user tim is an academic tutor [Music] who uses the hint to provide robust answers to um to the user excuse me why do i have hiccups um and then we can uh then we can copy the rest of this um let's see tim encourages curiosity and uses ask follow-up questions to spirits to spur curiosity and maintains a cool professional tone let's see tim encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening um yes tim maintains a cool professional tone okay so if we have the hints part up front let's see if this does a little bit better a lot of electrons the nucleus is held together by strong nuclear force electrodynamics well okay still didn't use the information from the hint but that was a much better response i like that let's run it again just to see what happens i almost think we just need to like just spit this out like what if what if the hint is the actual response um and then we don't actually use the chat at all like why add another step when we've got a good answer um okay let's do this again i might each of these answers is very very different which is interesting that's fine um okay okay yeah yeah this is fine um oh i well you know maybe i shouldn't be so unhappy about this because when i look at what this answer is so let's take a look at what the actual question was right so the um the wiki title was particle physics the question was what is the difference between a particle and a wave so that's kind of inferring a question that we might ask but that's not actually what was asked right and so then gbd3 maybe gpt3 is smarter than me this morning so gpd3 is actually answering this question and kind of ignoring the bit about like a particle but that is still priming it so this is i think is actually really good okay so let's just update the chat prompt with this because i like this i like this better whoops that's the script not the actual prompt prompt chat um so let's save that and i shouldn't need to restart it because i didn't change any code i just changed the prompt and it's going to be reloaded each time um okay there's a study of particles such as electrons and photons does gravity affect particles it's thinking obviously this is not fast enough to be useful yet but this is just proving out the idea that um that you can pull from multiple sources such as long-term memory which we don't even have the conversation long enough to do that yet and as slow as this is it might not work gravity is a force that affects all matter um okay cool cool cool is also what keeps the planets around the sun particles are affected by the force of gravity just like everything else good answer let's see what what that looked like in the back end so let's see wiki title particle physics can you teach me particle physics we already pulled that question what are some of those most famous findings of particle physics okay subatomic particles does it mention gravity no it doesn't okay so none of that made it in which is that's fine um and then let's look at the gpt3 logs for the final output you know i'm almost i'm almost more impressed with this output than than the actual chat output how long is this video we're already at 45 minutes all right there's gonna be a part three because there's something that i did not anticipate which is that all the thinking going on in the background is actually better than the chat output um so i'm going to stop here because i'm clearly on to something it's just not quite it's not quite there because i look at the i look at the precision of this and i'm like this is good and then i look at like how watered down the actual output is and it's it's not bad but it's also not the rigorous academic output that this is so i think just be by the fact that this prompt says like oh hey this is this is a chat um gpt3 this model might be overly aligned and so that it's watering down the responses and not giving me what i want so i'm going to stop here i'm going to save this code and then we'll come back to it because something is interesting is going on and i'm really impressed with what's going on in the back end and i'm glad i saved that debug but we're not quite there yet so anyways thanks for watching um i did want to say that i have a new patreon a bunch of people suggested that i should do discord and it was immediately popular a bunch of people have now suggested that i do patreon so that that way y'all can support me and who knows maybe one day i'll have enough supporters that i can do this full time but yeah so jump in on the discord jump in on patreon like and subscribe and let me know what you guys want to see next thanks for watching i'll talk to you later

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I'm disappointed because Tim didn't use the information from the hints. I'm doing some prompt engineering to see if I can get better results.

I'm encouraging curiosity and using compassionate listening to try to get better answers from Tim. I'm also maintaining a cool, professional tone.

I think just by the fact that this prompt says it's a chat, GPT3 is overly aligned and watering down the responses. I'm going to save this code and come back to it later.

Thanks for watching. Let me know what you want to see next.
