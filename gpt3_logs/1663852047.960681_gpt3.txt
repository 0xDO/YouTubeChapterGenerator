0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:30:54.960,0:31:00.240
more or less the same length broken up into chunks
so because basically think of it like an inchworm
0:31:00.240,0:31:05.120
the idea is you write one paragraph
at a time or so um so that's the idea
0:31:05.760,0:31:12.800
all right so we take the books we break it into
chunks then we summarize each chunk and so each
0:31:12.800,0:31:20.960
of these summaries is nice and concise
very short um oops don't need to go there
0:31:20.960,0:31:26.640
you don't need to see all the research i was
doing to try and figure some of this out okay
0:31:26.640,0:31:32.480
so then we've got the summaries finally so
we got oh we also have the outlines sorry
0:31:33.040,0:31:37.520
um the outlines which kind of outlines the whole
story just so that that way it knows what we're
0:31:37.520,0:31:45.120
trying to achieve okay so finally we put all
that together in a prompt um so here's the
0:31:45.120,0:31:51.120
the full prompt so basically we say okay here's
the outline here's the story so far and here's the
0:31:51.120,0:31:57.440
last chunk and we're asking it to produce the next
chunk so what i did was i saved all those out to
0:31:58.480,0:32:02.720
the same file names this this just makes it
really easy but one thing you'll notice is
0:32:02.720,0:32:09.360
that these files get progressively larger um
so whoops didn't mean to close that so let's
0:32:09.360,0:32:13.920
see which one is the shortest one i think alice
in wonderland is the shortest so the very first
0:32:13.920,0:32:20.240
prompt outline alice is sitting in in the river
or sitting with her sister by the river so cool
0:32:20.240,0:32:26.560
that's fine um story so far alice adventures in
wonderland is a novel by lewis carroll that's fine
0:32:27.520,0:32:35.600
last chunk so last chunk is like what what it's
so the the last chunk is that is the full prose
0:32:35.600,0:32:42.720
and the story so far um this one because it's
the very first one um just has the uh has the
0:32:42.720,0:32:50.560
summary of this um yeah and so then the next chunk
that we're going to ask it to produce is going to
0:32:50.560,0:32:58.880
be the same as so notice that uh this prompt or
this this one is 0 0 0 1 so the next chunk that
0:32:58.880,0:33:05.040
we're going to match it to is so we've got another
folder called completions so it's going to be here
