0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:11:55.320,0:11:59.220
person might be concerned about women's
rights and women's bodily autonomy other
0:11:59.220,0:12:04.620
people might be concerned about a fetus's
right to life or is that is that like is
0:12:04.620,0:12:09.300
that against their religion right does
it do they have a duty to protect unborn
0:12:10.380,0:12:15.060
um all these things and so then what you
do is you integrate all of those feedback
0:12:16.200,0:12:20.520
um and then you come up with a solution it's
you have to you have to explore with consensus
0:12:20.520,0:12:25.380
and you go forward and you say okay well what is
something what are the issues that people really
0:12:25.380,0:12:31.980
care about right what is it what is it that that
that they need in order to be happy or satisfied
0:12:31.980,0:12:36.900
with this and you know some people will just kind
of dig in their heels and say no I'm not going to
0:12:36.900,0:12:41.880
budge okay well so one of the first lessons of
consensus is if you're just going to be stubborn
0:12:42.780,0:12:48.900
um you don't you're not you shouldn't participate
in consensus because by virtue of entering into to
0:12:48.900,0:12:54.300
a system of consensus you have to be willing to
make compromises but it's not just a matter of
0:12:54.300,0:12:59.880
okay well we can keep the the abortion ban at
12 weeks if you give me this not that kind of
0:12:59.880,0:13:05.760
compromise you have to be more creative than that
because when you explore the issue of abortion for
0:13:05.760,0:13:15.900
instance you will one of the one of the issues is
the topic of of um of uh unwanted or accidental
0:13:15.900,0:13:23.340
or like forced pregnancies right like in the cases
of children being involved or rape or whatever and
0:13:24.000,0:13:29.520
um and so you say okay well what what about
preventing like what about preventing that
0:13:29.520,0:13:34.260
from happening what if what if part of
part of this issue is we have to address
0:13:35.400,0:13:41.460
um safety for vulnerable women and girls right
and it's like okay well so now the compromise
0:13:41.460,0:13:49.440
isn't you know changing the goal post of where the
abortion ban is the the the the the compromise is
0:13:49.440,0:13:56.460
let's address these other things too let's
it's it's not no but or or no end it's yes
0:13:56.460,0:14:02.280
and right that is the responses okay I hear
your concern here so let's address that and
0:14:02.280,0:14:08.400
this other thing that I care about right and
so you explore this further and at the heart of
0:14:08.400,0:14:16.320
it at one of the one of the reactions for men
for instance is um like father's rights or or
0:14:16.860,0:14:24.540
um or liability right um Financial liability
um some people don't want to not have any you
0:14:24.540,0:14:30.180
know like two people decide to have sex right
and one of them gets pregnant and if that one
0:14:30.180,0:14:35.520
has all the all the power in the situation all the
control that doesn't feel fair to the other party
0:14:36.840,0:14:43.920
um and you know so like two people and decided to
engage in an act knowing the risks and then the
0:14:43.920,0:14:52.380
risk um the one party has total control over if
one party has total control over all outcomes and
0:14:52.380,0:14:57.240
responsibility that feels very unsafe to the other
one so how do you address that and part of that
0:14:57.240,0:15:04.680
might be reforms of Parental responsibility in the
cases of accidental or unwanted pregnancy right
0:15:04.680,0:15:09.540
and so you keep negotiating all these all these
points and that's what I'm trying to get to okay
0:15:10.260,0:15:16.380
so I have shown that we can we can have nuanced
discussions because if you read this whole thing
0:15:16.380,0:15:20.880
I'm not going to read it to you um there there
is the possibility to have nuanced discussions
0:15:21.600,0:15:27.540
from a particular perspective with gpt3
but this is still not good enough so now
0:15:27.540,0:15:34.200
we need a way to generate even more nuanced
perspectives and I figured that out so rather
0:15:34.200,0:15:41.040
than having scalars which is like just a
number of you know like one to ten because
0:15:41.940,0:15:47.340
that's not a semantic thing and gpt3 is a language
model it's not a numbers model so I basically just
0:15:47.340,0:15:55.620
switched it to um to uh words right I am mildly
selfish instead of like one or two or three
0:15:56.400,0:16:02.700
um it's just I'm mildly selfish or whoops um or
extremely generous or whatever and so by using
0:16:02.700,0:16:07.560
these descriptive words by using these adjectives
extremely stubborn I'm extremely authoritarian
