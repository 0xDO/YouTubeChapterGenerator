0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:01.560,0:00:09.480
hey everybody David Shapiro here um I just saw on
Twitter that uh the hashtag support human artists
0:00:09.480,0:00:16.260
was trending and it really resonated with me um
you know there's this there's this this thing you
0:00:16.260,0:00:22.560
know uh no AI art AI art is theft if you search
for AI art you get a whole bunch of similar things
0:00:23.340,0:00:30.540
and this brought up something very personal for me
so I still get a lot of requests from on LinkedIn
0:00:30.540,0:00:38.880
Twitter Discord wherever of people asking me
to put up my code and videos that precipitated
0:00:38.880,0:00:45.120
my original Auto Muse projects and I've taken
them down and they're staying down and I wanted
0:00:45.120,0:00:52.980
to use this as an opportunity to explain why
when I got to a point where I realized that I
0:00:52.980,0:00:59.460
could automatically generate entire novels
I realized that I would hurt my friends
0:01:00.780,0:01:05.700
um I realized that I that I could hurt people
that I really care about um that being said
0:01:05.700,0:01:11.520
I'm not going to single-handedly stop this
tidal wave right you know you look at you
0:01:11.520,0:01:17.880
look at websites like Lexica and AI art is
here to stay generative AI is here to stay
0:01:17.880,0:01:22.860
the genie is out of the bottle even though a lot
of it's really weird some of it is really good
0:01:24.060,0:01:31.200
um and it really begs the question what is art
you know some say beauty is in the eye of the
0:01:31.200,0:01:38.040
beholder some say that art is human expression
you know um I'm a big fan of of both death of
0:01:38.040,0:01:42.240
the author but also death of the audience
does the author matter does the audience
0:01:42.240,0:01:49.020
matter because sometimes like for instance my
own novel I might never publish my own novel and
0:01:49.020,0:01:53.160
the reason is because I don't necessarily need
an audience I'm writing something for myself
0:01:53.880,0:01:59.820
that being said I have a lot of privilege because
I don't rely on my writing I don't rely on my art
0:02:00.780,0:02:08.040
um in order to you know make ends meet um and
so it really kind of you know there's there's a
0:02:08.040,0:02:13.860
philosophical question right like I said what is
art does it require an audience yes or no um but
0:02:13.860,0:02:21.600
then there's the economic question of livelihood
and you know AI is you know the there is there's
0:02:21.600,0:02:27.060
a great post on Reddit sorry let me mute my
phone there's a great post on Reddit that said
0:02:27.060,0:02:31.620
um you know if a year ago or a year a year
and a half ago someone would have told you
0:02:31.620,0:02:36.300
that that art was going to be the first thing
that AI you know disrupted they would have said
0:02:36.300,0:02:41.880
that you were a lunatic right um and so now
everyone is like okay well if they can come
0:02:41.880,0:02:46.740
after art they can come after everything right
and then there was that post that showed that GPT
0:02:46.740,0:02:53.400
uh chat GPT was capable of passing the bar
exam right so maybe no one is safe from AI
0:02:54.420,0:02:59.820
um and you know again I know that I'm not
going to single-handedly stop this uh but I
0:02:59.820,0:03:05.520
also don't have to participate in something
that I that I know could hurt people um now
0:03:05.520,0:03:10.680
where do we strike the balance right because
here's the thing is is electronic music real
0:03:11.460,0:03:18.300
you know I I can imagine that there was probably a
time you know when people said oh you know records
0:03:18.300,0:03:22.860
that's not real music radio that's not real music
you actually need to go witness it being produced
0:03:22.860,0:03:31.020
live by another human um or in CGI for filmmaking
right there's this popular quote of um of Ian
0:03:31.020,0:03:36.180
McKellen having um you know beginning emotional
on the set of The Hobbit because it was all green
0:03:36.180,0:03:43.080
screen there was there was it was a lot more CGI
a lot more green screen and a lot less on site
0:03:44.220,0:03:50.400
um and and practical effects uh for The Hobbit
versus Lord of the Rings and he said he reportedly
0:03:50.400,0:03:56.340
said something along the lines of this is not
how it's done right um but at the same time like
0:03:56.340,0:04:01.500
you can't put the genie back in the bottle right
electronic music is here to stay deep learning is
0:04:01.500,0:04:05.940
here to stay you know it's kind of like you got to
learn to live with it and it's because it's it's
0:04:05.940,0:04:13.740
impossible to put it back now we as individual
consumers can make choices right we might choose
