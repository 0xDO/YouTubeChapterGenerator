The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: appear it appears a lot let me delete this because eve should not be appearing in this hey tim okay that's that looks correct reload it yes eve uh what have i done hey tim okay so where is eve appearing eva is appearing at the end okay so why is it being appended at the end what have i done wrong that must still be in the format training data oh here it is him okay make sure okay fixed it again this is the problem of recycling code reload okay eve okay so there's eve no longer appears good don't want to control confuse the bot um all right so now let's go and open my fine tune one and we're gonna switch this back to tim and also da vinci so i when uh for the last one for the for the information companion um tutor uh for the information companion i switched to curie and it didn't do good um so i'll spend a few extra dollars to do the da vinci model because i think it'll actually be worth it um and then i'll pause the video again while this is training and then we're ready to test um but yeah again there's lots that you can do uh to make this cooler and more powerful and i think that i'm gonna need to do a follow-up video because i think there's a lot of potential here for for doing good in the world python fine tune and the way this should go uploaded pending excellent all right status pending i'll catch you on the flip side once this is done training and we're done okay so this question is for four-year-old me um user uh tim can you tell me why fire glows sure fire glows because it is emitting light the light is emitted as a result of the fire's temperature the higher the temperature the brighter the light user okay but why does heat make it bright because it makes the atoms and the object move faster when the atoms move faster they emit more light users why does atomic movement emit light atomic movement emits light because the atoms are emitting light photons each atom has a certain amount of energy and when it emits a light photon it loses that energy oh okay so i um so photons are light but what about heat i'm pretending like i don't know that infrared radiation is the same thing um how does it lose that why is fire hot um yep okay so fire is hot because it is emitting a lot of light photons user wait light photons can carry heat too yes light photons can carry heat the light photons carry the energy from the atoms to the object so the object gets hot because it is receiving the energy from light photons okay um tell me more about heat photons they are emitted when atoms emit light photons okay it's just repeating itself um one thing that i wanted to show is that if you increase the frequency penalty to about 0.5 um it will stop repeating itself as much so let's see um okay it just it just killed itself anyways there that's that um there's a lot of potential here i think i'm going to do some work on this and make a follow-up video um because this is a billion dollar idea let's fix education and um and uh yeah make the world a better place so thanks for watching um i hope you enjoyed it like and subscribe and if you do make a company with this and make a billion dollars cut me a check

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It appears that the code is appending "Eve" at the end, which is causing her to appear in the final output. Tim fixes the code and Eve no longer appears. He then explains that he switched to the Da Vinci model for the information companion, which should be more accurate. He pauses the video while the training data is being processed.

Once the training is complete, Tim asks a question to "4-year-old me." He asks why fire glows and "4-year-old me" responds that it is because the fire is emitting light. Tim then asks why heat makes it bright and "4-year-old me" responds that it is because the atoms are moving faster and emitting more light. Tim asks why atomic movement emits light and "4-year-old me" responds that it is because the atoms are emitting light photons. Tim asks about heat photons and "4-year-old me" responds that they are emitted when atoms emit light photons.

Tim concludes by saying that there is a lot of potential in this idea and he plans to make a follow-up video.
