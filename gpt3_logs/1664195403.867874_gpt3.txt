TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here we are going to dive back into artificial cognition working on building an acog or an artificial cognitive entity uh let's do a quick review of where we left off so where we left off was i have um the main loop of the acog which is the inner loop so this is the thought so in terms of how this compares to a human if you're just sitting there thinking and not doing anything that's what this is if you're thinking let's see what should i do today or what happened yesterday what do i make of this that is what i mean by the inner loop this is this is cognition that is not connected directly to action that's what we're working on right now so but basically what i did was i started breaking it up into nested loops and so you've got the main loop which is just ongoing reality and then there's several smaller loops within that i haven't worked on it in a little while and there's a reason and that reason is because i'm working on a book i'm working on my third book which is called symphony of thought and basically if you want to master something write a book about it because writing a book will reveal everything that you don't know or all the assumptions that you made and so in working on this book i have come up with a few things that i was missing so let me show you a high level idea of how this goes so the first thing is context so context is all the information you take from the outer world so this is um this not necessarily outer world this can be contact from your body right do you feel hot or cold um what do you see what do you hear what has happened recently so that's context then the very next thing that we do is we do assessment um and so assessment is like okay what do we make of this situation um in in the brain in neuroscience this is this is automatic inference like that ball's coming at my face right um or that car is gonna crash or someone said my name that's what i mean by assessment where it's just like okay let's just establish what's going on in the world let's let's start to get the the the most baseline um information extraction about this uh so that we can start making sense of it the next thing that happens is recall so based on what we see and hear and smell and feel our brain automatically recalls relevant memories so if you see your best friend you your brain automatically recalls the last time you saw them previous conversations if you walk into a new room you remember what happened last time you were in that room but you but you forget why you went into the room because your brain said oh this is a new task set let's throw away all those memories that we just had and open a new task set because our our memory is associative so this is one of this is one of the most critical things this is one of the most critical shortcuts that human brains take is that our memories are associative which means that like um we associate uh time and place but also event and people right and there's a lot of other associations everything we do is associative um so anyways based on what's going on in our outer world and the assessment we make of it then we recall memories and these memories there's two type there's two overriding types of memories there is episodic memory which is anchored in time that is what happened to me this is what i observed and then there's declarative memory which are just facts abstract facts that are not connected to a time or place and those those two memory systems are actually different memory systems in the brain which is why if you have amnesia you can still remember everything you learned in school but you might forget your past um okay so then you you take the context that's the input you assess what's going on you recall all the relevant stuff now what so the next step is ideation um your brain has neurons canonical neurons which anything that you see or hear or feel feel um these these neurons will automatically start imagining what you can do in that environment so this is like a micro service that's running in our heads at all all the time i talked about this in a previous video and someone made the hilarious comment like so if i see a fork there's neurons in my head that immediately think i can throw that fork yes that's exactly what happens um and in fact if you have if you have damage to your brain that that harms your your executive function like if you there was a story and i think it was on task um where there was a guy that had damage to his his self-censorship um and so he could or in inhibition and so if he saw a bed bed meant get undressed get in bed go to sleep and so he couldn't stop himself if he just saw any bed he would just get undressed and get in it because part of his brain said oh that's what bed is for and so that's what i mean by ideation it's coming up with possibilities and then discernment so once you once you um when you come up with ideas it's like okay i could do x y or z which one should i do or any are any of those bad should i should i do a loop and kind of come back so another thing with discernment is um is you might say actually um you know let's let's uh let's come up with a different set of ideas so this might actually be a loop right so let me add a little connector here um so discernment is saying what do i expect is going to happen is this in alignment with what i want to achieve yes or no and then finally agent model which is which is okay given given what the goals are the most abstract goals because like imagine you know if i'm talking to you about climate change and when whenever we come up with ideas whenever we're brainstorming you hear i'm saying we right it's it's not the royal we like we should do this it's we as in collectively we as in humanity so the the concept of we says what should we do about this um whether it's there's you know a dog attacking a child or climate change or a meteor coming to hit earth what should we do about it so we is detached from the self

==========

Artificial cognition is the process of building an artificial mind. In this video, David Shapiro reviews the progress made on the artificial cognitive entity (ACOG), and explains how it works.

Shapiro begins by breaking down the main loop of the ACOG into smaller, nested loops. He explains that the first loop is context, which is all the information the ACOG takes in from the world. Next is assessment, where the ACOG makes inferences about what is happening. Recall is the third loop, where the ACOG retrieves relevant memories. The fourth loop is ideation, where the ACOG comes up with ideas of what to do. Discernment is the fifth loop, where the ACOG evaluates the ideas and decides which to pursue. Finally, the agent model is the loop that determines what the ACOG should do.

Shapiro explains that the book he is working on, Symphony of Thought, has helped him to identify some gaps in his understanding of artificial cognition. He is hopeful that by continuing to work on the ACOG, they will eventually be able to build an artificial mind that can think and act like a human.
