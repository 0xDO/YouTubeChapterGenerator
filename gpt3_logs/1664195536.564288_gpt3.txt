The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: we'll um and let's say an alignment so this could actually do do everything um an alignment with my purpose um okay so then we'll say logs and we'll come over here to conductor service and we'll say um prompt uh this is gonna be um allies okay let me say explain why analysis let's see are my modules operating correctly or should i modify them explain why yep so this should be a pretty solid prompt that i can integrate into the conductor service so what we'll do is we'll just copy this so instead we'll say prompt analysis no analyze and then we'll replace block with logs and so the text block already pulled the recent recent things um this might actually do all of the above so what we can then do is we'll just say yeah so we'll say analysis equals gbt3 completion prompt save and send and we'll send that and we'll replace this with the um prefix content prefix that's what it was called and then what was the yep content prefix tag the tag is oh that's the file right okay so we save that out to logs um so we'll just do this analysis because so the purpose of this let me show you um if i go out to not that one imperative service so i save a log so basically what what's going to happen is every microservice is needs to save its own logs so that way it has its own data to work with later on so that's the purpose of having a separate logs file all right so then we go back to here and we go to um why does this keep getting reversed probably me i'm probably doing something okay we are looking at the conductor service so we need to add a folder for logs um yep yeah so every microservice will need to keep its own logs so that's basically going to be its own training data and then what it can do is it can it can pull the nexus for other data so say for instance the imperative service issues this idea where it's like hey um ideas to suffering we could provide more opportunities for people to learn and improve their chess skills um this is in response to the guys playing chess we could make sure that everyone has access to a chess mentor we could create more opportunities for people to compete in chess tournaments we could provide more for more support for people who are struggling with mental illness so yeah uh so what it can do though is once the conductor is online it might look at that and say hey you're not actually providing ideas that will help in this situation and so over time this tension it basically creates a generative adversarial network inside the inside the the what am i trying to say inside maragi or inside the our artificial cognitive entity and so by having multiple different models and these all don't have to be gpt-3 either you could have t5 you could have um you know the alexa tm you could have bloom you can have gpt3 you can have neo x you can have all these different models um with all these different fine tuning data sets and they're basically competing with each other or not competing that's not the right word they're basically cr you're creating tension between all these different models um and and while they're interacting with the outside world um right now it's just in a simulation environment but they're basically evaluating their own performance over time by having that tension and so internal tension is actually critical i'm going to pause it i have a book to show you uh and it's relevant and i promise okay here's the book um i've been talking about this the last few videos conversat uh consensus through conversation um consensus uh is basically a human version of a generative adversarial network um we're rather than having you know majority rule which is robert's rules which is broken um which is based on parliament um so it's like a 200 year old paradigm almost um consensus is a new parrot newer paradigm um so basically when you create when you create a a consensus in humans everyone contributes their thoughts to the conversation so you notice it's a ring huh yeah look at this look at this look how similar this is um so there's a reason that it's all organized like this so all the microservices contribute to the nexus and then they all contribute their unique perspective and they're going to be fine-tuned to have very particular perspectives over time so for instance um in the future one of the things that i got to work on is a prediction service or a prognostication service so all that this does without any ego or bias all it does is just predict okay how is this going to play out it has no sense of self it just is a prediction model that says if x y and z are true and you're you perform action a b and c this is what's going to happen and it'll look for it'll imagine best case scenarios worst case scenarios that sort of thing so it'll contribute its ideas to the nexus and then you might have a discernment service so discernment is about identifying things that are particular to the current situation such as risks uh dangers failure harm loss of life and costs so like material costs energetic cost time money um it will also incorporate things like swot analysis cost benefit analysis murphy's law so that's the purpose of a discernment service which is just going to say okay we can do this but it is going to hurt us or it's going to cause you know it's going to cost we're going to run out of batteries or something like that and then you'll have a planning service a rumination not server service where it's just going to be thinking about it philosophically gpt-3 is really good at waxing philosophical particularly original da vinci and then you'll have an executive service that will say like okay have i thought about this enough am i ready to act and so on and so forth and so by having all of these different services all contributing to the nexus they will they're basically creating a generative adversarial uh uh network of multiple of an arbitrary number of models that are all going to be working together to come up with the optimal outcomes but they're also going to be

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The purpose of the logs file in a microservice is to store data that can be used later to train the microservice. This data can be used to improve the microservice's performance over time. By having multiple different models, each with its own unique perspective, the microservice can learn to identify the best possible outcomes for a given situation. This internal tension is critical for the microservice to be able to adapt and improve over time.
