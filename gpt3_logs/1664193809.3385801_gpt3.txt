The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: assistant or a chat log it can take that and run with it so that's what we're that's what we're aiming for okay the stories are done um and I'm working on the bullet points version so I think that you'll see some some utility in this um so I think I've got the prompt okay um so bullet points should include topics such as two from subject intention goals tone and so on so basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to train it to or create a data set that will be able to just say Okay given a list of you know a few things it will be able to to do this um and I think that like two from subject tone intentions this is great um intentions and goals uh this is probably all we need so then let's switch to um marketing email about a fun new product uh two potential customers subject intention and uh yep great um this should have more detail and so in the long run imagine you know your intentions you might change a bullet point to say something like um you know product description or whatever um but we can we can augment that later and see how well it handles it but remember um one of the things is that uh is that we also have stories right so we're training this model no one format has to be perfect um and we're training this model to do all kinds of different stuff um and we'll see how it goes so let me go ahead and copy this so we'll say we'll do um uh scenario um be creative as this is an imaginary scenario bullet points and we'll save this and we'll say prompt bullet points okay and then we'll go back to so we've got our Baseline intents that's not going to change oh one thing I did was because there were so many work related ones I went in and added like b2c stuff and vendor stuff um and B2B examples um because like okay so we get some marketing stuff in here too um all right so we're there prompt bullet points and then we do synthesize bullet points so we'll come in here and we'll just we'll basically just change this for to bullet points um and so for modifier to modifiers um so I'll actually change this to modifier uh because we're we're taking those Baseline intents um oh and then we need to add the uuid uuid get a little bit more entropy synthesize bullet points and so then we'll change this to the bullet points um that should be good bullet points yep that's where it should land python synthesize bullet points to announce new baby um oh snap I messed up stop stop stop halt so one so what I do often let me show you where I messed up um see how there's no no new lines um so I often remove new lines from from output so that it's all one paragraph but if you need a list you don't want that so we'll comment out this line that's what this does this compresses it all into one paragraph um and we will delete these and start over this is why you check your work as you go all right let's make sure this looks good to announce a new baby and we should get some legit bullet points okay cool um all family members and this is good so you see how it's giving different formats we you actually want messy data when you're fine-tuning gpd3 especially if you want it to be Universal you really really want it to have like different formats some of them you might not even have bullet points and what that does is it trains the model to be able to tolerate and interpret different kinds of input so this is going well I'm going to pause it again do a little bit more work on the back end and then we'll be back okay and we're back um I took a little while and I created there's four different types so I've got bullet points so here's an example of what I mean by bullet points so it's just like you give it kind of a kind of a stack of uh of um of items uh all different kinds uh so it's just you know relatively unstructured um so that's one type and then the next type is conversations so I synthesized a bunch of conversations where it's like a chat log and it's like um I need to request a work from home Arrangement is this permanent or do you need it just for a certain period of time I need it for a certain period of time I have a family emergency okay I can draft an email um no that's all thank you so you know just imagine like you have a a chat bot that'll help you write emails that's what this is for um I need to communicate with the housing office what do you need to save the housing office sometimes it cuts off that's fine um uh so there's bullet points there's conversations there's messy emails so I asked them to make really like rude emails um hi I'm struggling my classes wonder if I could talk to you to get some help from an academic advisor I'm really struggling starting to feel overwhelmed thanks so like there's nothing wrong with that it's just it could be better right it could be more diplomatic it could be more thorough more clear um let's see I need to talk to someone in student services so this is a lowercase it's you know written a little bit a little bit trashy um and then hey there Bible lover [Laughter] yeah so these are these are examples of emails that could be better and then finally the stories which is where we started and so um we've got you know hey you've been dating your current partner and things are starting to get serious so here's a story right which like um you might just kind of dictate this like here's my story write an email for me um so given these different formats um what I did so there was four steps to synthesize each of those and then there was four more steps to synthesize the perfect email so here is what the final ones look like and there's you can see down here there's 400 total samples let's pick a longer one so um here is an example of a bad email being Rewritten to be a good email so I can't stand working here anymore I've had it with the long hours of crappy pay and impossible demands management is always on our backs breathing down our necks we never get a break obviously like

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I can't stand working here anymore. I've had it with the long hours, crappy pay, and impossible demands. Management is always on our backs, breathing down our necks. We never get a break.

Obviously, this is an email that someone might write especially if they're frustrated. So it's important to note the tone, which is angry and resentful. The intention is to vent and complain. The goal is probably just to get it off their chest.

Now, let's rewrite this email with a more positive intention and goal in mind.

Hi [Manager],

I hope all is well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. The workload has been really heavy and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm just wondering if there's any relief in sight or if you have any suggestions on how I can better manage my time.

Thanks,

[Your name]
