TRANSCRIPT: story write a few sentences about the theme of the story be imaginative and creative title alienation the last battle theme all right let's see if this works theme of the story is the fight for survival the human race is in a desperate battle against the hostile alien force and they are fighting for their very existence the story is about courage and determination of the human spirit this is like your typical catastrophe story and how we will do whatever it takes to survive okay that's um let's see let's do write a paragraph or two um let's see explore universal truths and ideas let's see if we can get a little bit more than this generic boilerplate whatever we're faced with overwhelming odds we must maintain our hope and resolve that's a little bit better let's try that again theme of the story is the fights for survival the story is a testament to the human spirit and our will to survive against all odds okay i mean that's pretty much what this story is about so that's fine so we'll copy this come over here uuid and then we'll do idle premise we'll save this as prompt theme dot text okay and so then we'll come back to plotter01 and so we've got the title here so let's go ahead and do prompt open file and we'll just copy that theme now uuid string theme premise premise and then we also do need to do dot replace title with the title that we generated and so then the uh the theme here theme equals gpt3 completion temperature we'll leave that the same that should be good um yeah okay all right we don't need to do the maker this time so then we'll just do um save file story path plus theme beam all right so it's just a couple steps here and there um so let's test it again oh actually let's output stuff as we as we go so we'll do premise i'll do airline new line and then we'll do print title and title and then we'll do the same for meme okay so now we'll get some output as we go and i don't have to go back into the folders every time premise the crew of the ship the explorer the prisoners of planet x what is this the 50s that's great get some pulp the theme of this story is learning and understanding human aliens are both curious about each other and they learn a lot from each other the aliens learn about the humans in their world and the humans learn about the aliens in their world the theme is also about cooperation and understanding okay cool i love it i love it okay so this is the expansion this is the brainstorming part of the story okay so we're getting some good early success but let's not get too ahead of ourselves um let's go back into um here stories so prisoners of planet x love it love it um all right so next let's consult my diagram um we need a setting okay so describe the settings in great detail um yeah this is going to be this is where it's starting to get a little bit harder so we'll come in here we'll grab the prisoners of planet x so playground um [Music] so let's see given the following story um describe the settings in great detail list the settings um [Music] now instead of describe we'll say uh describe or imagine the settings in great detail um if there are multiple settings list them out and write about them include details such as history culture geography and so on okay so title the prisoners of planet x and then we'll go in here and grab the premise and come here and the theme the theme we generated is this okay oops and then setting all right so let's see what it does very different from earth and the aliens are very different from humans humans are not familiar with the planet and they don't know anything about the aliens the aliens are curious okay so this is very generic um let's see be specific um come up with place names and concrete details okay detailed setting okay well it's not coming up with a name but that's a little bit better so all right i'm probably gonna um gonna go just move on from here because um coming up like inventing um like religions and cultures and place names that's probably going to require fine tuning especially because the instruct series is so kind of generic like this so i'm just going to let this go for now and we're just we're aiming for an mvp okay so we'll do this iuid um let's see we'll do idle premise theme okay and we'll do back up here and we'll do prompt setting uh let's actually write this a little bit different um brainstorm about the settings settings for the following story write a few paragraphs let's see if that's any better because if you use the verb brainstorm it's usually much better the aliens live in the desert in huge glass cities that's interesting huh okay it still didn't write a few paragraphs but that's okay planet x i guess that's the name of it okay made up of skyscrapers and connected by bridges oh this is much better much better okay cool so we'll copy this out and come here okay so brainstorm is good we'll definitely need that when we get to character so let's come here um here i'll pause it you don't need to see me this is just going to be the same thing over and over again okay let's test this to make sure it works python plotter 01 in the dark and rain soaked streets of a nameless city a hard-boiled private detective okay the big sleep i love it uh corrupting influence of power the victim was a politician all right setting the story set in a dark and rain silk city the city is nameless but it is clear that it is a large city um actually that's interesting like if you if you just never name it it's just like yeah okay the victim is a well-connected politician all suspects are powerful people with something to hide okay um yeah it ends up talking about the the characters which i don't like um but uh yeah this is gonna require fine tuning let's just get through it let's see what works and what doesn't and then we'll do fine tuning because fine tuning takes 100 times as much effort as prompt engineering okay so what's next next on the docket is characters okay cool so given all that let's brainstorm a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The theme of the story is the fight for survival. The human race is in a desperate battle against a hostile alien force, and they are fighting for their very existence.
