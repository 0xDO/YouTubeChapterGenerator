TRANSCRIPT: you're live okay i am live level check hello let's see how do i share the pop out the chat um aha there we go you all right the internet has been rather off today so we'll see if anyone shows up level check okay down checks level check how does it sound level check how does it sound good good good oh hey got a couple of people coming in all right i know it always takes a minute to get going oh folks thanks for joining had one leave it's okay it happens just getting going just had someone on twitter ask me for a private message so i guess we'll go ahead and get started um so the question oh it's jordan hey jordan um listening but also working okay cool so we'll do a live live live uh entertainment that's fine um i'm not gonna do song and dance um so anyways okay so question from twitter um what's your eta on agi um so eta estimated time of arrival for agi is artificial general intelligence so i'm gonna say that well so first it depends on how you define agi so one popular definition of agi is that uh it's a machine that can do anything that a human can do any intellectual tasks that a human can do um yeah okay i've said on many of my videos that i don't like that i don't like the term agi because it's artificial general and intelligence so it's kind of vague it's kind of squishy to me the goal is to create a thinking machine that can think anything and then intelligence is you just measure how smart it is right because intelligence will go up over time and in humans intelligence is actually often measured by speed um that's why iq tests are timed um it's often about how far you can get and and how fast um okay that was not someone messaging me on one of the many apps let me mute that out sorry about that um so anyways iq which is the you know most famous way of measuring intelligence is more about speed um you know so but then another way that you can measure intelligence is what problems are you capable of solving right but if you set that as the threshold of agi there are many humans that cannot solve certain problems right like you wouldn't want to put me in charge of you know a moon rocket um or a heart surgery right and so when you set the bar as like artificial general intelligence uh it's really vague because it's like okay um let's see isn't intelligence compression i'll get to that good question um so intelligence from from a from a [Music] some some schools of thought think that intelligence is just a form of compression i don't agree um it's about computation but anyways in terms of eta so i think that that you know some of the all the research that's going on i see lots of folks doing um doing similar work to what i'm doing on cognitive architectures et cetera et cetera i think that we're gonna have uh agi within two years now the question is gonna be how fast is it um what problems can it solve and how much does it cost to run so cost to run is gonna be up there because we already have things that can think right there's there's large language models there's multimodal models they can solve problems they can brainstorm they can um they can monitor their own performance if you set up the cognitive architecture right but they're also very expensive to run so those are three things that are gonna you know kind of slow down now to uh to old old zany's question isn't intelligence compression um no short answer no um biologically speaking or in humans intelligence is pattern matching and pattern recognition now you might say that like artificial neural networks are about um are about compressing enough patterns that you can generalize them or something you know because then you end up with patterns and meta patterns right like patterns about patterns and patterns to generate new patterns um and decomposing patterns and generating in increasingly complex patterns but from a neuroscience perspective or a psychological perspective intelligence is not about compression it is about patterns now that being said you could you know argue that compression is just about making a big pattern into a smaller pattern okay sure um you know we can we can we can go with that definition all right so there's a few folks oh well i'm getting many thumbs up thank you folks for whoever is jumping in and giving me thumbs up um yeah so the purpose of this stream is because i've got my third book on ai coming out sorry i'm third there we go i have such small fingers anyways um so the first two um first is natural language cognitive architecture um yeah i know funny i i make fun of myself i have very thick hands because i do climbing and lots of building and stuff but my fingers look really stumpy anyways so natural language cognitive architecture is my first book um this one uh i put this out before fine tuning was available um so fine tuning came out and it kind of nullified a lot of this but the ideas are still there where you've got um interlocking loops shared databases search um there's a lot in here that's still valid and also people say that they like my uh my diagrams so i've got you know diagram of my core objective functions in here and so on um this was a lot of work um and then so then my second book is benevolent by design which is strictly about the control problem so the control problem is how do you prevent ai from getting murdery how do you prevent it from being skynet because here's the thing um if you have ml pipelines and autonomous machines that can think on their own and come up with their own objectives how do you know that you're not going to end up with a machine that is going to change its own objectives it's going to change its operational parameters that is the purpose of this book how do you create a machine that has values that it will keep those values and that is that is the key here which is creating something that that will ultimately believe in the same framework that that you want it to believe in and then my latest book i don't have a paperback copy yet because the

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The purpose of this stream is to discuss my third book on AI, which is focused on artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is a machine that can do anything that a human can do – any intellectual tasks that a human can do.

The goal is to create a thinking machine that can think anything and then intelligence is you just measure how smart it is right because intelligence will go up over time and in humans intelligence is actually often measured by speed. IQ tests are timed because it is often about how far you can get and how fast.

From a neuroscience perspective or a psychological perspective, intelligence is not about compression – it is about patterns. However, you could argue that compression is just about making a big pattern into a smaller pattern.

The control problem is how do you prevent ai from getting murdery how do you prevent it from being skynet because here's the thing – if you have ml pipelines and autonomous machines that can think on their own and come up with their own objectives how do you know that you're not going to end up with a machine that is going to change its own objectives it's going to change its operational parameters. That is the purpose of this book – how do you create a machine that has values that it will keep those values.
