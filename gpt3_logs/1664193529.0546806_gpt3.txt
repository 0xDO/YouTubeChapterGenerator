The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: the traffic lights you can actually then say okay let's everyone in that town comes to consensus on how they want the traffic lights to run and then the Tau network is upgraded upgrades itself with that API call and then manages the traffic lights going even bigger you could say hey let's imagine a future you know a few decades out or maybe a few centuries who knows how long it might take you could hypothetically have the whole world basically managed through consensus where everyone participates in consensus and anything that you want the government the government uh which is this distributed autonomous organization that operates on consensus and self-improving code anything you want it to do the whole world can work on and do that so one example that I asked them about was let's say you wanted to regulate the stock market with Tau you can do that so any rules that you want it to imply or enforce could theoretically one day do that and that is the strength of having this distributed automated code generation and execution and integration and so um yeah I was completely blown away after I after I got a chance to talk to them because this is just I don't know it's like let's see a life AI research lab says hi hello welcome um but yeah so I was completely blown away so there was a book talk to who about what says angel baby I don't know oh I guess you just jumped in so for anyone who just jumped in I was talking to um some of the folks at Tau about their distributed autonomous organization here I'll drop a link in the chat so that anyone who just joined can catch up here you go um okay so where was I things are coming faster right so there's a book that I read it was recommended to me by a friend it's called liquid rain and the premise of this book I mentioned this in my video earlier so I apologize that this is a recap um but uh so the book liquid rain is uh guy goes into a coma because he's in a car accident and he wakes up like three decades later and like the singularity has happened and everything is post-scarcity and everything is cryptocurrency and everything is distributed autonomous organizations great fun right but one of the things that's explored in that book is this concept of distributed governance and also uh redistributed wealth and so I read this book I was like okay great this is all hypothetical it's this is very Pie in the Sky future but then as I have been learning about Tau their vision is to implement that to make it real where you this is this is like the operating system for the government of the future um and they're not the only ones doing this right there are plenty of other folks well plenty I know of at least two or three other groups um working on uh creating a Dao type thing for the purpose of revolutionizing you know government but also the the most interesting thing is is the idea of having a distributed AI system so there's several schools of thought where it comes to things like AGI artificial general intelligence or what I call artificial cognitive entities um and that is that you might have uh if you have an AGI that is a single entity right it's running on a server or it's in a robot like Ultron then it can go crazy it can go off the rails it can come up with its own ideas because it is a singular entity that can you know forklift itself from one platform to another but what if your AI is distributed and it's not it's not only it doesn't have a single home but it is intrinsically embedded in society now your first reaction might be to say like okay well that's even worse because if you have a distributed AGI that's embedded in everything if it goes Haywire it's going to kill everyone really quickly because it's going to be in every medical device in every car whatever however when you remember that Dows the distributed autonomous organizations they operate based on consensus so that means if we ultimately endow or uh yeah um endow a a distributed network with any kind of autonomy or general intelligence it will be with the consensus of everyone which means that the design of it will be worked on over time and the uh the capabilities that we give it will be worked on with like a global consensus basically or distributed consensus with however many people are participating and so that means everything that that does will operate on consensus and so that means that like that's not a guarantee but one way that that could be implemented is that the AGI will have the primary you know objective function of maximized consensus whatever consensus is maximize behavior that optimizes for human consensus which is a very interesting possible objective function now here's another thought experiment with consensus and oh I need to specify I'm not talking specifically about Tau anymore um because this is all just my own speculation so I am not speaking on behalf of Tau uh I just want to clarify like I'm not their spokesperson or anything I just had an interesting conversation with them and my mind is churning about possibilities so I just wanted to to clarify and pull back on that just a second and okay someone jumped into a Discord chat but that's fine um Okay so possibilities right so here's an interesting thing if because a dowel works on consensus if the whole world or whoever's participating comes to the consensus that that Dow needs to shut self down that code can be created and then executed right like if everyone says like this Dao is going haywire let's shut it down like that could happen um alternatively if people say hey like this Dow is going crazy we need to completely restructure that can happen too okay so that's my opening Spiel and it's been 20 minutes already so let me um we've got a few folks in chat so let me ask uh what questions do y'all have in terms of distributed artificial intelligence and distributed autonomous organizations um I will also repeat this in chat just for anyone who jumps in what questions do y'all have about distributed Ai and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential for distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) and distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs). These concepts offer the promise of more efficient and effective ways of governing society and managing resources.

DAI refers to a type of AI that is distributed across a network of computers, rather than residing on a single server. This has the advantage of being more resilient to tampering or failure, as there would be no single point of failure. Additionally, DAI has the potential to be more intelligent than traditional AI, as it would be able to tap into the collective intelligence of the network.

DAOs are organizations that are governed by a set of rules encoded in software, rather than by humans. This has the advantage of being more transparent and efficient, as there would be no need for human leaders. Additionally, DAOs could be more responsive to change, as they could be programmed to automatically adapt to new circumstances.

The concept of using DAI and DAOs to govern society is still in its early stages, but there is potential for it to revolutionize the way we live and work. What questions do you have about DAI and DAOs?
