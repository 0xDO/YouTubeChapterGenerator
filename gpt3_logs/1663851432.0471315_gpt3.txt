0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:22:42.240,0:22:50.100
traits so that way you can just have that as
like the character's core Constitution um yeah
0:22:51.120,0:22:55.200
okay all right well I'm gonna go ahead and pause
it because this data will take a while to finish
0:22:56.220,0:22:59.640
um and I'm also like branching out in different
directions I don't want to get make this video
0:22:59.640,0:23:05.460
too confusing all right we're at 588 so um got
about 100 samples left we'll be back in a minute
0:23:06.660,0:23:13.680
okay we are rapidly oops you don't need this um
we are rapidly zooming in on the final product
0:23:13.680,0:23:23.880
so it's going to be 699 or so 694 I think it just
finished um there we go all right so you might be
0:23:23.880,0:23:30.000
looking at like okay why like you just did this
with prompts what's the what's the advantage so
0:23:30.000,0:23:38.040
the advantage is that um because because I've
got the the prompts built in and then I have
0:23:38.040,0:23:42.300
a whole bunch of data showing the structure
so I'm not trying to teach it anything new
0:23:42.300,0:23:47.880
I'm just basically guaranteeing that it's
going to follow the right format okay so
0:23:47.880,0:23:56.760
first let's go ahead and we've got our scenes
folder which is 1.8 megabytes well I guess 528
0:23:56.760,0:24:05.520
actual kilobytes 694 samples so we'll copy our
scenes directory over to our character simulation
0:24:07.020,0:24:12.600
um because hey you know we just generated this
data it's super valuable um and then what we'll
0:24:12.600,0:24:22.200
do is we will um do so we've got next scenes
right so now let's open up generate next scenes
0:24:23.520,0:24:31.440
um and this is going to be so for file in files OS
Lister scenes we'll print out the scene and we'll
0:24:31.440,0:24:39.300
do prompt next so prompt next is going to advance
the plot so we'll say prompt next long detailed
0:24:39.300,0:24:45.420
next scene um this this works relatively well
sometimes it's a little too short sometimes not
0:24:46.620,0:24:54.000
um but yeah um so let's see use your imagination
to describe the following scene in great detail
0:24:54.000,0:24:59.100
we want to see a play-by-play of what's going
on in this environment um let me actually well
0:24:59.100,0:25:08.220
yeah uh okay I think this is all set so
we'll come back here and do um let's see
