The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: but it also means it's the most uh or the least creative instruct beta is a little bit more creative but it does still have some random behavior and then plain vanilla da vinci once you get good with it you can get this to do pretty much anything but it does require a lot more structure because well here let me just show you if you remove everything and you go back to plane da vinci this is what might happen hi sheriff let's see if we remove all this player sheriff yeah so you see how it's just like kind of just running off with it here actually let me remove the stop so you can see just how random this is player horse [Laughter] yep so this is what i mean by like da vinci can completely go off the rails if you don't provide it enough structure it's just taking this and running with it but you know if you go back a few a little ways in the video and you see where i had given it some dialogue already da vinci understood oh we're writing dialogue now okay i think that's good um yeah just some tips and tricks about using gpt3 to generate fiction thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

If you're looking to use GPT3 to generate fiction, it's important to keep in mind that the algorithm is relatively unstructured. This can lead to some pretty random behavior if you don't provide it with enough guidance.

One way to avoid this is to be more creative with your instructions. For example, rather than just telling GPT3 to "write a dialogue," try giving it more specific instructions, such as "write a dialogue between two characters." This will help keep the algorithm on track and produce more coherent results.

Another tip is to use the "stop" function sparingly. This will help prevent GPT3 from going off on tangents and will keep the focus on the task at hand.

With a little bit of creativity and careful instruction, you can use GPT3 to generate fiction that is surprisingly coherent and well-written. Thanks for watching!
