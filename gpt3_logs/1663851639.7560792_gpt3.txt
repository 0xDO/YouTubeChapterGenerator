0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:13:02.560,0:13:10.400
when i get around to it um okay so the question
um let's see oh adrian says hello hello we'll
0:13:10.400,0:13:18.800
listen while working on my dolly composition um
so yes um we're doing ai here all day every day
0:13:18.800,0:13:24.720
um i'll put in i'll put in chat that acronym
that i just said maragi equals micro services
0:13:25.440,0:13:34.400
architecture for robotics and artificial or i
know how to spell like problems artificial general
0:13:34.400,0:13:39.760
intelligence okay so that's that's the ultimate
goal is to create a cognitive architecture
0:13:39.760,0:13:46.000
and here's the underlying philosophy behind how
it's going to be stable um so on and so forth okay
0:13:46.800,0:13:50.800
okay cool we got some more questions coming
in so now get to old zany's question because
0:13:50.800,0:13:56.640
he or she or they had it first um the possibility
that agi has already been created in another
0:13:56.640,0:14:02.560
sector of our galaxy okay so this is one of my
favorite topics are we alone in the universe
0:14:02.560,0:14:08.080
functionally right now we seem to be alone we have
telescopes and radios all over the place and we
0:14:08.080,0:14:13.840
see and hear nothing now we just figured out how
to build radios and telescopes so it's entirely
0:14:13.840,0:14:19.280
possible that they're just not sophisticated
enough to see other civilizations out there
0:14:19.920,0:14:27.200
so that's one possibility another possibility
is that they're hiding from us right if they're
0:14:27.200,0:14:32.480
millions of years more advanced than us then they
can just be stealth or whatever or hide you know
0:14:33.440,0:14:38.400
they can they can out maneuver us right because
the thing is is like with just a little bit more
0:14:38.400,0:14:46.400
technology you know like if you were to drop a
uh you know a 60 year old airplane or a 100 year
0:14:46.400,0:14:53.200
old airplane into a battlefield today it would not
have a snowball's chance in hell against a modern
0:14:53.200,0:14:58.160
jet fighter that's only one century of time
difference in technology now imagine you extend
0:14:58.160,0:15:03.040
that out to you know by several orders
of magnitude um you know a million years
0:15:04.160,0:15:10.320
if if if there is an alien race out there
somewhere that has invented agi or anything
