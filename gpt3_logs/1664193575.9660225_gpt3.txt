TRANSCRIPT: but gpt3 can produce excellent Pros as long as it's about a thousand words the the the the the biggest barrier is like okay can you keep track of an entire story because remember an entire is 50 000 words right you're not going to fit all that into one prompt even if you summarize it right because everything that all the lore you need to keep track of is not going to work right now believe me I tried and I'm like one of the top folks in the world working with gpd3 it there you cannot summarize it concisely enough you lose too much detail um I'll probably publish what I've got soon maybe tomorrow anyways uh one last comment do you think we're gonna have ai based art classifiers that rank pieces of art yes that's one of the things I'm working on I'm building my own generative adversarial network with with one GT3 model versus another to make better synopsis and better plots stay tuned see that tomorrow probably all right have a good night everybody [Music]

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It is possible to produce excellent writing with GPT3, as long as the text is around a thousand words. The biggest challenge is keeping track of an entire story, as 50,000 words is a lot of information to include in one prompt. However, it is possible to summarize a story concisely and still retain important details. I am working on a project to create an AI-based art classifier that can rank pieces of art, and it should be ready to share soon.
