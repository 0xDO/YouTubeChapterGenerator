0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:29:46.860,0:29:54.420
worker output like economic output has continued
to increase while labor input has either flattened
0:29:54.420,0:30:00.600
or tapered off actually in some Industries this
is going to accelerate that so what happens when
0:30:00.600,0:30:08.460
the productivity per hour of labor on average
aggregate like goes up 10x from what it is
0:30:08.460,0:30:13.980
today how much are we actually going to need to be
working that's that's a non-trivial question but
0:30:13.980,0:30:17.700
then you all there's other questions like okay how
do you ensure that everyone gets what they need
0:30:18.660,0:30:22.140
um you know do you do some kind of
redistribution or credit system or whatever
0:30:22.980,0:30:27.480
do you redistribute the labor that's one
of the reasons that that some economists
0:30:27.480,0:30:33.840
are calling for shorter work weeks is hey let's
just cut everyone's week in half and then you
0:30:33.840,0:30:39.360
have twice as many people that you hire right
so that you redistribute the work um rather
0:30:39.360,0:30:45.420
than redistribute the capital I don't know if
that's going to work um or that I don't think
0:30:45.420,0:30:49.260
that's a complete solution I think that because
some people are just going to be pushed out of
0:30:49.260,0:30:56.340
the the labor market entirely and chat GPT proves
that I don't have the article brought up but there
0:30:56.340,0:31:01.260
was one that said uh chat GPT past the bar right
it passed it passed a practice test for the bar
0:31:02.340,0:31:08.520
so if chat GPT is smart enough to pass the
bar exam which is how you become a lawyer
0:31:09.060,0:31:14.100
what else is it smart enough to do is it smart
enough to be a doctor is it smart enough to
0:31:14.100,0:31:21.240
take my job my day job as an I.T technologist
possibly so then if you have this technology that
0:31:21.240,0:31:26.160
is infinitely cheaper to run even as expensive
as it is to run it is infinitely cheaper than
0:31:26.160,0:31:33.780
human labor right the marginal cost of of AI
versus human labor is like it's a million times
0:31:33.780,0:31:39.720
cheaper to run right because you can get an expert
opinion from AI granted there's still problems
0:31:39.720,0:31:43.860
with confabulation which I'll show you I'll
end it I'll end this on that problem because as
0:31:43.860,0:31:49.380
optimistic as I am there are still some very large
problems to overcome with this technology before
0:31:49.380,0:31:54.720
it's ready for the for game time right before
it's ready for to take Center Stage there are
0:31:54.720,0:32:00.540
some problems to overcome however the potential
is there okay so what is that potential if you
0:32:00.540,0:32:07.140
have if you can do high value intellectual human
labor with a machine that costs a few pennies to
0:32:07.140,0:32:13.500
run per minute whereas you know the the the cost
of a doctor is you know about 10 or 20 dollars per
0:32:13.500,0:32:19.080
minute that's how much their time is worth let's
see because if if someone charges let's say 600 an
0:32:19.080,0:32:23.520
hour that's ten dollars a minute of is how much
their time is worth so that's that's a that's a
0:32:23.520,0:32:30.420
specialist lawyer or actually that's an average
lawyer and like a specialist doctor right or or
0:32:30.420,0:32:36.360
um or a experienced physician so let's just say
that that expert human labor is about 600 an hour
0:32:36.360,0:32:44.220
but this can this can can perform the same number
of tasks One faster um because these things spit
0:32:44.220,0:32:49.320
out text real fast um and then it only takes a few
cents so then you're looking at something that is
0:32:49.320,0:32:55.200
like sixty thousand times cheaper than than the
human expert um again marginal cost of medicine
0:32:55.200,0:33:00.840
could drop to near zero can you imagine what if
your medical bills per year is like ten dollars
0:33:03.600,0:33:10.740
then it's like okay it's practically free right
what if what if your legal bills or your financial
0:33:10.740,0:33:16.680
like you know getting your taxes done and and
your CPA what if all that is you know cost ten
0:33:16.680,0:33:24.120
dollars a year maximum um it again it's really
difficult to see what's going to happen and then
0:33:24.120,0:33:31.680
the question is okay people see that value and
and so you know if if that's if that's the cost
0:33:31.680,0:33:36.180
of providing that service and there's multiple
people offering that service I know I can hear
0:33:36.180,0:33:40.680
some of you this is what I stopped I was like my
mental model of the audience was like oh yeah but
0:33:40.680,0:33:45.060
if there's if there's that much value to be
bought to be gained someone's gonna squeeze
