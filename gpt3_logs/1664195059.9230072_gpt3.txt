The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: bugs a try and then it adds this so yeah i think what i'll do is i'll add a double new line between those so that so that each end put an output like there's demarcation so let me fix that real quick so rather than just chunk with a space we'll do slash n slash n there are a variety of bugs you can eat but not all of them are created equal some bugs are better for you than others and some simply taste better if you're looking for the best of both worlds here are some of the best bugs to eat grasshoppers are a great source of protein and they taste pretty good too if you're looking for a nutritious bug to add to your diet grasshoppers are a great choice crickets are another popular choice for bug eaters they're high in protein and low in fat making them a healthy option they also have a mild nutty flavor that some people find quite pleasant if you're looking for a bug that's both nutritious and delicious mealworms what am i a mouse they're high in protein and fiber and have a mildly sweet flavor no matter what kind of bug you choose to eat make sure you get the uh okay so why not give them a try so it's it's going to be a little bit repetitive so we're probably if we want to write a whole book with this we're going to need to um clean this up but that's fine at least it'll generate a lot of content all right so let's do this recursively i think we overcame that last barrier increasingly verbose let's go hmm it looks like okay it condensed the first one i wonder why it did that i probably have something that caused it to do that okay so look for bugs in dark moist places this is okay but it wrote it as a list and that's not what i want uh okay well we got we're off to a decent enough start um this looks like it's not any much better than the original idea which was just to um here so let me comment out this stuff and we'll just do um the first one which was just i just told gpt3 to expand on it um yeah so we'll just duplicate all this yeah and so therefore each expansion will be separated out um yeah okay so let me just let me just show you what the original did because we're not getting we're not getting the results that i want eat bug clear the output save that all right so there's basically two modes that this script operates in which is like break it into two cognitive tasks or do another or do a um or do it as one go we're kind of getting there it's generating good ideas but it looks like in order to expand on them i might also need to say like expand on each individual idea um we'll see it doesn't it it might take some fine tuning or something to do um but yeah okay so let's just let me show you the original process so you can see like it's actually not much better um oops eat bug you won't even taste the difference okay so that worked um let's do make the following passage longer yep add lots of detail and new ideas rewritten longer version okay so now okay so that's that's working so we'll take this recursively do it and we'll you'll see that like you basically get the same results just with the one one stage so it looks like in order to brainstorm something and keep expanding on it it's going to take a few more steps because we only got to about three paragraphs um okay this is good so the input was this guy which is 371 characters long um you know you may think eating bugs sound gross but bugs is really good for you output did you know that eating bugs is really good for you you may think it sounds gross but they're packed okay so that's not that's not too bad um all right so let's try this again eventually so that we we did the same thing with recursive summarization where eventually it just won't summarize it any further um and it seems like gpt3 will do the same thing where there's a limit to how much it will expand on each idea so it might be that in order to expand on each idea we need smaller chunks because what i do here is i break it into chunks of that are 3000 words long or less or characters i think that's characters um so it might be that we need like smaller chunks like take a hundred hundred words um and expand each of those um like sentences basically okay so now we've got this as an input which was 673 characters and now it is 1500 okay this is doing all right um let's keep going maybe maybe i was wrong maybe my intuition about breaking this task up was was not correct um because the the original prompt seems like it's doing really well so let me just show you the the prompt that it's using right now make the following passage longer because you can see it's just using prompt.txt so prompt.text is right here so it's just recursively feeding into itself um yep so yeah let's uh run it again let's we're going to take this until it stops eventually we'll get to a a place where it probably won't expand it any further but remember it just started with eat bug so you just take one idea and expand it into a whole paragraph and there's still value in that right i was really ambitious when i said like let's get it to an entire book okay so that's that's it we've gone from two words um you know and like eat bugs so that's seven characters to fifteen hundred characters so that's a factor of um seven divided by fifteen uh fifty-four oh wait now that's to go the other way 1554 divided by seven so we made it 222 times longer than it was originally um so that's a pretty good amount of expansion i think i'm satisfied with that um okay cool well i'll leave the other prompts up there in case anyone wants to play with them and i'll also leave the script where it's got this other one so i'll just um add a comment here like original method single stage cognitive task works okay can take a phrase um can let's say transform a phrase into a paragraph or so um uh let's see um two stage method works a little bit better but not really great am disappoint i think i misspelled disappoint is that right okay all right so we'll leave it we'll leave it as that get status get add all git commit am

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Bugs can be a nutritious and delicious addition to your diet, but not all bugs are created equal. Some bugs are better for you than others, and some simply taste better. If you're looking for the best of both worlds, here are some of the best bugs to eat:

Grasshoppers are a great source of protein and they taste pretty good too. If you're looking for a nutritious bug to add to your diet, grasshoppers are a great choice.

Crickets are another popular choice for bug eaters. They're high in protein and low in fat, making them a healthy option. They also have a mild nutty flavor that some people find quite pleasant.

Mealworms are high in protein and fiber and have a mildly sweet flavor. No matter what kind of bug you choose to eat, make sure you get the best bang for your buck by choosing a nutritious and delicious option!
