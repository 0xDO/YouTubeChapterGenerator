0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:22:35.940,0:22:42.600
as a trunk whatever and then of course we'll we'll
I don't know we will have some some notion about
0:22:43.980,0:22:50.220
the object the concepts that people may want
to talk about in this way we have realized we
0:22:50.220,0:22:55.200
have limited the focus in communication to
what we call what has been called what is
0:22:55.200,0:23:00.300
called normally in in research and application
computer science uh control natural language
0:23:00.300,0:23:07.380
so we limit the syntax to be usable Enough by
everybody so we cannot speak freely it's just
0:23:07.380,0:23:13.080
like me as a foreigner not as a native English
speaker I would speak English so I subject verb
0:23:13.080,0:23:19.200
object right it's a very simple sentences not so
simple but again somehow a language is sort of
0:23:19.200,0:23:22.620
this International English that everybody
would understand and would be able to use
0:23:23.340,0:23:29.760
plus the fact that we understand all the
words all the concepts that are embedded in
0:23:29.760,0:23:36.300
this uh in this in this natural language
so uh somehow unlike we were saying is
0:23:36.300,0:23:39.960
the limitation of the natural language
that is unlimited and we want to limit
0:23:42.420,0:23:50.040
yes yeah so the the because it's so powerful
you and you introduce problems like the the
0:23:50.040,0:23:55.440
flexibility is computationally difficult but
also the ambiguity um is a major problem of
0:23:55.440,0:24:02.520
not just syntax but the meaning of individual
words and um and and Ohad I remember um you had
0:24:02.520,0:24:08.820
mentioned previously um the the mathematical
aspect of language versus controlled language
0:24:09.780,0:24:17.880
um would you would you like to add a little bit
to uh what Professor franconi just just shared and
0:24:19.440,0:24:25.020
maybe just one thing because Professor
Franklin basically covered the log
0:24:25.020,0:24:32.040
and which is the concept of
decidability that is the question
0:24:33.480,0:24:43.320
when you have a computational task for example the
task for finding a contradiction among statements
0:24:44.820,0:24:49.800
it turns out that there are
many many computational tasks
0:24:50.400,0:24:57.480
that cannot be solved in finite time they need
infinite time to be correct those taxes be correct
0:24:58.620,0:25:07.440
because you can do a finite computation
and be incorrect right yes and and
0:25:09.720,0:25:14.640
in this case is called undecidability the
things that you cannot solve in finite time
0:25:17.460,0:25:19.140
now um
0:25:21.180,0:25:29.340
what people in the field of logic do they Define
languages and they ask whether determining
0:25:30.060,0:25:37.140
whether any statement in this language contains
a contradiction is decidable or not and then if
0:25:37.140,0:25:40.800
yes then you call the whole language decide
the bell and if not you call it undecidable
0:25:41.880,0:25:48.780
it turns out that even very simple languages
are already undecidable for example um
0:25:49.740,0:25:54.420
the language of arithmetic the natural numbers
one to three with addition multiplication
0:25:55.440,0:25:56.880
is already on the side open
0:25:59.100,0:26:03.840
okay this was this is the famous Gathering
completeness building from a hundred years ago
0:26:06.900,0:26:13.380
there is the trade-off between expressiveness
and decidability the more you are able to sing
0:26:13.380,0:26:19.140
the language the less recyclable it becomes
and in particular natural language because we
0:26:19.140,0:26:23.700
can express arithmetic natural language and
of course natural languages and decidable
0:26:26.940,0:26:31.560
there is another problem which
which is about consistency
0:26:33.180,0:26:40.560
some languages can um contain a contradiction
in the very definition of the language or let's
0:26:40.560,0:26:44.520
say you can construct sentences
that are not true and not false
0:26:46.500,0:26:52.260
any natural language you can do so indeed maybe
that's a typical example is the liar paradox
0:26:54.060,0:26:56.880
the sentence that cannot
be true and cannot be false
0:26:58.200,0:27:04.080
so you want a language that
is consistent and is decidable
