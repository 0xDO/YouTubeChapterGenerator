TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here um i had an idea so i posted on reddit and also the um the uh open ai forum this idea because people keep asking me um if i will consult and i don't want to consult uh for paid gigs mostly i just want ideas uh that's how i you know solving tough problems is how i learn and uh so i had this idea send me your gpt3 prop or your gpt problems i'll solve them for free and make a youtube video so basically i said okay you know what problems do you want me to solve and this guy storyghost aia said i would be interested in a gpt3 generated actionable feedback or constructive criticism at the stylistic level not spell check or grammar mistakes might use cases for fiction writing but any type of writing would do for instance if the original sentence is he was super in love with her like a lot the ideal gpt3 completion would be something like provide an example that shows the depth of his love instead of just telling the reader also the writing comes across as informal with the word like okay so basically looking for a prose editor or a line editor or copy editor uh so i was like yeah let's do it before i get too far in this video i do have to warn you that um i'm about at my quota uh because i've been making these videos like crazy and i was like where did all this money go um because i was looking at this and it's like okay you know twenty six dollars thirty two dollars forty dollars fifty sixty seventy dollars then i jump up to a hundred and fourteen dollars and then up to 157 so i was like where did i use all this money um turns out the novel writing fine tuning job was a 40 job oops so um i got to cool it off for a week until um the billing cycle ends and i will pick this up in june however in the meantime i wanted to at least show you what i've done so far and unfortunately i didn't document the whole process because i was kind of multitasking um while while coding this up but it is available online if you just go to creative writing coach so our github slash dave shap creative writing coach all of it will be up here um actually let me go ahead and just cd creative writing coach get status get ad um get commit am um ready for plebs to use ha you're all plebs get push okay okay so it's all updated for y'all to use um but let me show you how it works and if you if you want to spend some of your hard-earned tokens please feel free to uh to run this okay so here's the repo uh so where i started was download writing prompts so if you go to this subreddit um r slash writing prompts this is a really great way to get amateur writing oh whoops we don't want it in json format um so our slash writing prompts is someone will give you a writing prompt and then everyone replies with like a short story right and so the top level comment is pretty much always a short story and it's written by someone on the internet so in order to satisfy this idea like rather than use gpd3 to generate synthetic data i was like let's get real world data because human mistakes are going to be very different from gpt3 mistakes you can ask gpt3 to make mistakes but it's going to make the same kind of mistakes over and over again whereas if you crowdsource it and you get you know stuff from different people you're going to get different formats different ideas some people respond with poems short stories story fragments um scenes you know whatever you're going to get a lot more variety so what i did was i wrote this script which was just i copy i bashed a bunch to a bunch of other scripts together so all i did was get top posts so i look for the last month of writing prompts get the top posts download the top level comments for each one and i saved that out to a folder called stories and so i've got 388 stories in here of varying lengths the shortest one i think is a poem yep and then the longest one is 10 kilobytes um so this is uh 10 000 characters long so that's you know that's going to be what about 2 000 words so that's still flash fiction um okay so i downloaded a whole bunch of stories and then what i did was well first i needed to um i forgot to exclude bots and short stuff so what i i went and removed the stuff that we don't want because you don't want to fine tune on bot data um okay so then what i did was i wrote a prompt so here's what the prompt does and i've started splitting it out into more granular steps um so the prompt well here let me just show you what the prompt does i can spend some tokens on this so at least you can see what we're talking about here this prompt does not work on anything other than davinci um curie is not smart enough to provide feedback um okay so let's go grab a story let's get one that's about two kilobytes um because that's a good that's a good like bit of flash fiction okay so this prompt says adopt the persona of a professional creative writing editor read the following story and provide detailed feedback to improve the pros hold the author to the highest literary standards feedback should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions so then story and then i add a little dmarc and then um okay oh what got him style end story provide detailed professional editor feedback with suggestions and examples to improve pros this end has gone through several permutations as i tried it because in some cases it tried to continue the story in other cases it just did all sorts of random stuff but this this prompt seems to be pretty consistent so let me show you what it does and we'll do the feedback up to 500. let's see okay it says it's clear the author of the story is creative and has a good sense of humor however there are some areas that could use some improvement first the story is very short and feels incomplete it's

The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

Hey everybody, David Shapiro here. I had an idea and posted it on Reddit and the Open AI Forum because people keep asking me if I'll consult for paid gigs. Mostly, I just want ideas. That's how I learn and solve tough problems.

I said, send me your GPT3 problems and I'll solve them for free and make a YouTube video. So basically, I said, "What problems do you want me to solve?" And this guy Storyghost said he'd be interested in GPT3-generated actionable feedback or constructive criticism at the stylistic level - not spell check or grammar mistakes. He gave the example of fiction writing, but said any type of writing would do.

So I was like, "Yeah, let's do it." Before I get too far in this video, I do have to warn you that I'm at my quota because I've been making these videos like crazy. I was looking at my spending and was like, "Okay, you know, 26 dollars, 32 dollars, 40 dollars, 50, 60, 70 dollars." Then I jump up to a hundred and fourteen dollars and then up to 157. So I was like, "Where did I use all this money?"

Turns out the novel writing fine tuning job was a 40 job. Oops. So I got to cool it off for a week until the billing cycle ends and I will pick this up in June. However, in the meantime, I wanted to at least show you what I've done so far.

Unfortunately, I didn't document the whole process because I was kind of multitasking while coding this up, but it is available online. If you go to Creative Writing Coach on Github, all of it will be there.

Let me show you how it works. If you want to spend some of your hard-earned tokens, please feel free to run this.

Okay, so here's the repo. Where I started was with a download of writing prompts. If you go to this subreddit - r/writingprompts - this is a really great way to get amateur writing. In order to satisfy this idea - rather than use GPT3 to generate synthetic data - I was like, let's get real world data because human mistakes are going to be very different from GPT3 mistakes. You can ask GPT3 to make mistakes, but it's going to make the same kind of mistakes over and over again. Whereas if you crowdsource it and get stuff from different people, you're going to get different formats, different ideas. Some people respond with poems, short stories, story fragments, scenes - you know, whatever. You're going to get a lot more variety.

So what I did was I wrote this script which bashes a bunch of other scripts together. I got the top posts from the last month of writing prompts, downloaded the top level comments for each one, and saved them out to a folder called "stories." I've got 388 stories in here of varying lengths. The shortest one is a poem and the longest one is 10 kilobytes.

So I downloaded a bunch of stories and then what I did was I wrote a prompt. Here's what the prompt does. I can spend some tokens on this so at least you can see what we're talking about.

This prompt says, "Adopt the persona of a professional creative writing editor. Read the following story and provide detailed feedback to improve the prose. Hold the author to the highest literary standards. Feedback should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions."

So then I add a little bit of text and then... Okay, oh. What got him? Style? End story. Provide detailed professional editor feedback with suggestions and examples to improve prose.

This prompt has gone through several permutations as I tried it because in some cases it tried to continue the story, or it just did all sorts of random stuff. But this prompt seems to be pretty consistent.

Let me show you what it does. We'll do the feedback up to 500. Let's see... Okay, it says, "It's clear the author of the story is creative and has a good sense of humor. However, there are some areas that could use some improvement. First, the story is very short and feels incomplete. It's possible the author was going for more concise, minimalistic style, but in general, a bit more development would be helpful. Second, the story is very light on descriptions. Readers are given very little information about
