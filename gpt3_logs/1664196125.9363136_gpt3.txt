The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here with another early morning update um let's see we have been working on oh actually here let me cancel uh half blocks real quick okay uh there there we go um okay so this is cognitive architecture research update um i have added to the diagram because there's another microservice that i need which is the embedding microservice um so i've introduced i've introduced the nexus which is um here it's publicly available um and i've done a little bit of updates on the nexus um so the nexus is the is the the core the brain of artificial cognition um and then the conductor this will be later on i've also done research on the core objective functions but then i started working on a simulation microservice and we'll get in we'll get into that in just a second but then also an embedding microservice which i wrote a while back using google's universal sentence encoder because it is fast and free um okay so first let me just show you get you up to speed i did a couple things to fix the um the simulation service so let me just zoom in here so what i did was this is the same load last scene generate an event given a backstory and a scene so generate an event then you generate a new scene and then you save it and then you summarize the backstory including the new scene and then it repeats so let me show you what that looks like i've got an example here so given the following scene and event write a new scene so backstory this is this was running the uh the example so it invented you know the men were playing one loses uh he practices obsessively um so this is the this was the original scene and then here's the event the man who lost the chess game to the other man quickly defeats him the next time they play taking his revenge so then here's the new scene that it generates the man who won the game is shocked and he can't believe that he was beaten etcetera etcetera so you can see it's much more coherent now um so the two things that i did was i changed it from world state to scene and then i added the backstory which just takes all of this the scene event and the new scene and summarizes it um and so the it'll recursively summarize it so that the most recent information is going to be the most reliable information or the most complete and then the older the information is the more concisely it will be summarized so you know it's just a few basic scenes given the following scene an event write a new scene write a concise summary of the following and then given the following scene imagine a rarity event so i have this so you can swap this out so you can say like likely rare um extremely rare or dangerous event or whatever so you can modify it describe the event in one or two sentences so you give it the backstory you give it the current scene and then it generates an event those three prompts we've got a text-based simulation i'm working on putting it together as a microservice and so if we go back to this instead of vision this will be we'll call it simulation um so it'll be the simulation microservice let's make this a little bit bigger um i'm being i'm being ocd about this there we go simulation okay so the simulation microservice is going to feed stuff into the nexus but it's also going to read stuff back out because eventually what's going to happen is the output will be in the nexus and so then the simulation will need to be aware of what our agent is doing um which you know here's the agent so that's like what am i capable of there's a whole bunch of other services this is going to be like a big radial spoke um thing before too long so uh you've seen what the simulation does um blah blah et cetera et cetera okay so we've got we've got the simulation i've got to just code all this up into a finish the microservice now you see i've got a whole bunch of functions here so these are all the micro service functions so i've got nexus send nexus search nexus bound and nexus save there's a there's a fourth function actually which is fetch so these are all functions that i've added into the nexus service so the first one is add which is just it's a super simple you send a message it gets registered in the nexus and stored with a vector so you can search later so the second function is search required vector field count etc what this does is it you send it a vector and you say give me all memories that are relevant to this vector um we're going to assume i might just remove the field um because we're just going to assume that that everything is going to be in the vector or in a field named vector so probably remove that just to simplify it and then uh so this this returns a um this returns a list of all the most similar memories uh which is uh so so the reason that this is is because human memory is associative so like let's say you've got a memory that you're like playing chess for instance in this example so you want to look for things that like okay what was the you know give me all the memories that we have of you know um playing chess and revenge and stuff and so you immediately pull all relevant memories to whatever's going on and then you you can then use that to construct or reconstruct memories rather and then that will also speak to your current situation now associative memory is one of the primary ways that humans also rapidly generalize right because um deep learning or uh what is the what is the term i don't remember but like if if knowledge and skills become deeply embedded in your mind so that you can just use use it intuitively you don't need to think about it that's one kind of learning right and that is that is the kind of learning that happens from from deep learning transfer learning fine tuning where it's so deeply embedded you don't need to think about it but we also need to have an agent that is capable of thinking and say okay i don't know i don't have an intuitive model of how to do this but i need to think through this and that is where associative

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this research update, I discuss the progress I've made on my cognitive architecture diagram and the addition of a new microservice, the embedding microservice. I also give an update on the simulation microservice and show how it has been improved. Finally, I discuss the nexus, the core of my artificial cognition research.

The nexus is the brain of artificial cognition, and the conductor is the core objective function. I've also done research on the core objective functions but I started working on a simulation microservice and an embedding microservice. The simulation microservice will feed information into the nexus, and the output will be in the nexus. The simulation will need to be aware of what our agent is doing.

The embedding microservice is used to vectorize text so that it can be searched. This is important because human memory is associative. This means that when we try to recall a memory, we often think of related memories as well. This is how we rapidly generalize.

The simulation microservice is important because it allows us to test our artificial cognition research. I still need to code all of this up into a microservice, but I have made progress. The next step is to finish the microservice and then test it.
