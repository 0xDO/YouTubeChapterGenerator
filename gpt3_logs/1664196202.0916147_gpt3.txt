The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here with a uh state of the industry video it's a second one in my new series where i just kind of help you keep your finger on the pulse of the industry of ai broadly um but right now transformer space such as um image generation and natural language processing first i want to do a little bit of housekeeping though so as you may or may not know i am set up on patreon um so before we get started if you would consider hopping over to my patreon it's patreon.com daveshap and consider supporting me here um yeah that's i love what i do and and if you help support me maybe one day i can do this full time who knows anyways another thing that i wanted to do is do just a tiny bit of um self-disclosure and and raise awareness so i'm on the spectrum which whenever i tell people no one is surprised i guess i'm that weird it's pretty transparent anyways i wanted to share two books i've talked about them before unmasking autism and the pattern seekers um so basically i didn't know that i was autistic and i discovered it in my mid-30s like a lot of people do i discovered i did what many people do which is go down youtube rabbit holes find other autistic content creators and listen to their stories but what i will say is that these books are really helpful so devin price unmasking autism this really expanded my understanding of what of how autism presents in different people and you realize that autism is way more common than you think and then the other one is the pattern seekers which is kind of the more conventional definition of autism where it's like you know you've got the the the genius inventor kind of model um which is simon's um primary thing so you know take that part with a grain of salt but one thing that i learned from from this book is that of all the genes identified that are associated with autism the vast majority of them are common variants it's just a matter of if you've got you know 100 of these variants versus 200 versus 50. um so it's it's not it's not even like a mutation it's just random recombination of common genes okay so with all that said housekeeping out of the way um subreddits are starting to ban ai art i've seen there's been a lot of consternation on twitter about ai art obviously you know you get the stable diffusion hashtag and you see plenty of stuff i love it but the big concern is what's in the training data and you see that unstable diffusion has been banned so unstable diffusion was about all the weird cringy violent or sexual generations from stable diffusion reddit just flat out banned it and then i checked on twitter and twitter has actually purged most unstable diffusion tags look at this this is crazy there's only like a dozen less than a dozen unstable diffusion tags so it's pretty normal for there to be backlash against anything that changes um you know like people were people were grumpy about radio and other things so like you see stable diffusion is alive and well um but there's backlash so i heard a rumor that art station was gonna start banning um ai art and again it's it's mostly for for concern for the artists and copyright law so this has yet to be litigated um in the in the courts um if you do a quick search there's there is like what it looks like is that the at present it's not possible to copyright ai generated art there's a little bit of legal precedent for that i don't know if it's going to stand up so again it's got it's going to be litigated however so here's the thing a lot of folks so you look at the reason that unstable diffusion was banned so quickly um there was a great video i think it was on nebula if i find it i'll put a link in the in the comments speaking of um you all need to behave because i turned off my comments um and and my life got better um because the paradox of becoming more popular is that there's more trolls and more people who just want to argue look i've been on the internet for a long time i've been on plenty of debate forums i got it out of my system you do not want to debate me i am better at it than you um so if you get grumpy at me i just block you right i don't have any time for debate uh it's a waste of time and mental energy anyways okay so rewinding um where was i uh yeah so anyways um there's always backlash against against these new new new um new technologies and new changes oh here's another stable diffusion video these are great like why would people want to ban this entirely new art form now that being said there is a legitimate concern for copyright law existing artists so on and so forth but this is a whole new space right like you can't put this genie back in the bottle there and there are also countless examples throughout history of when new technologies cause a lot of uh pain and grumpiness so the vcr which is now an outmoded technology video copying and recording the vhs players and recorders though they tried to ban those because it was too easy to record broadcasts from um from uh uh for what am i trying to say blah sorry um like radio broadcasts uh or tv broadcast but also to copy other movies and stuff and so but did that work no they said like um the vcr itself is a neutral technology it's if you use it you know that's why all the videos if you're old enough to remember the fbi warning of doom at the beginning of every vhs video which is it is illegal to make copies of this so they reminded you all the time and so technologies are generally neutral what they do is they ban um they ban uh certain behaviors right and so the reason that unstable diffusion was banned this is this is the surprising part um is actually credit card companies so credit card companies stand behind all internet transactions basically whether it's a for-profit site like it's you know you're selling something or if it's an ad generate ad ad revenue um site the the payment processors stand behind all of that and if the payment excuse me if the payment processors see like child porn or

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

There has been a lot of consternation lately about the state of AI art. In particular, there is concern about what is in the training data for these AI art generators. I have seen firsthand that subreddits are starting to ban AI art, and that Twitter has purged most unstable diffusion tags.

There is a legitimate concern for copyright law existing artists, but this is a whole new space. It is impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. There are also countless examples throughout history of when new technologies cause a lot of pain and grumpiness. For example, the VCR (video copying and recording) was met with a lot of backlash when it was first introduced.

The reason that unstable diffusion was banned so quickly is actually credit card companies. Credit card companies stand behind all internet transactions, and if they see child porn or other illegal content, they will shut down the site.
