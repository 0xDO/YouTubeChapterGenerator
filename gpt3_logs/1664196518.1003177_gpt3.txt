TRANSCRIPT: going to um that is going to like make a difference that's going to give them a little bit more to work with yeah so in the in the final one this would actually be like a user story if you wanted to integrate this into agile you'd actually take these insights and generate a user story be like as a parent with children i need more control over parental controls that do x y and z because my children you know downloaded and spent five thousand dollars on my credit card something like that you you would need a little bit more detail if you wanted to send this to a product team um but we're just doing product or prompt engineering also if you want to contact me i do consult so if you have this idea this need and you want help consulting and making this into a commercial application let me know okay so some of these are really stupid on fire great buy processor is slow yeah great kindle on fire great buy like i don't like this very slow less cumbersome awesome product yeah so we're getting a lot of irrelevant details um i think it might be um i might need to do a little bit more prompt engineering okay make the tablet more user-friendly make the tablet faster and more responsive improve the quality of the apps include a user's guide interesting make charging port more durable see that's one that we keep we keep seeing make the tablet more stable okay so we're starting to see some patterns emerge um i think that i might have messed up this this original prompt because it i wanted a thorough list of all key strengths weaknesses and improvements um and i did also say list all the unique points that customers say about this product um so let's see summarize the following product reviews um as a list of these strengths weaknesses and improvements um that might be better um so then we'll just say we'll just say list of all key strengths weaknesses improvements for this product um i'm getting lost in the weeds i'm just doing a little bit of prompt engineering we're getting a little bit closer to having the pattern that we want to see also one thing that you can do in the long run is if you get enough of these runs where you get the kind of formatted output that you want especially if um if what you're looking for is um is an actual rfe which will follow a very specific format or if it's not an rfe because rfes are for products a request for enhancement or a feature request you might need a user story which is for software so those you'll want to do fine tuning and maybe i'll do another video of those later about how to automatically generate um rfes and um and user stories yeah i'll call it there today i think you get the idea that there's a lot of potential for automatic um uh data data handling um so thanks for watching consider joining my discord community um uh there will be a link in the comments as well as consider supporting me on patreon if you like what i do um let me know and uh and i can do more of it thank you

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

There is a lot of potential for automatic data handling when it comes to product reviews. By taking the time to format the output of customer reviews, companies can easily generate requests for enhancements (RFEs) or user stories. This can help to improve the quality of the product and make it more user-friendly.

In particular, companies can focus on making the tablet more responsive and less cumbersome. They can also work on making the charging port more durable and improving the stability of the tablet. By taking these steps, they can make a big difference for customers and help to improve the overall quality of the product.
