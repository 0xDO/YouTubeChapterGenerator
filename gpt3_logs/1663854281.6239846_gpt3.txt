how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

metacognitive practice or or meditation um
but this is what's called cognitive control
0:10:46.320,0:10:50.160
and most cognitive control happens in regions
in our brain that we are not conscious of
0:10:50.880,0:10:58.960
um and i talked about in the last video about in
cases where cognitive control breaks such as adhd
0:10:58.960,0:11:06.320
or other brain injuries brain lesions
stroke tumors traumatic brain injury where
0:11:06.320,0:11:10.160
your cognitive control breaks down and you end
up with what's called executive dysfunction
0:11:12.720,0:11:19.120
so basically what we're trying to do is first
we have to recreate those higher order um ideas
0:11:19.120,0:11:24.560
of cognitive control and so what your brain is
doing at all times completely unconsciously is
0:11:24.560,0:11:28.320
it's keeping track of your environment
it says what's going on around me what
0:11:28.320,0:11:33.600
am i doing um what should i be doing and those
sorts of things and so what we have to do next
0:11:34.160,0:11:39.120
is first now that we've got like all the all
the real low level stuff like keeping track of
0:11:39.120,0:11:45.200
memories and sensations and input then we have to
evaluate what's going on what should we be doing
0:11:45.200,0:11:51.520
what should we do next how do we do it because you
don't have to consciously plan a lot of stuff your
0:11:51.520,0:11:56.400
brain in the background is doing all of this for
you so like when i say hey it's time for me to
0:11:56.400,0:12:02.560
make a youtube video my brain just automatically
ejects a bunch of ideas into my consciousness
0:12:02.560,0:12:07.520
so there are clearly neural circuits operating
behind the scenes and so that's what we're doing
0:12:07.520,0:12:12.640
here is we are creating some of those
that neural circuitry behind the scenes
0:12:12.640,0:12:17.360
now why was i talking about core objective
functions or heuristic comparatives
0:12:19.440,0:12:26.560
so in my book benevolent by design i talk about
how there are several places in artificial
0:12:26.560,0:12:35.840
cognitive entities where we can put morality um
by by embedding our moral compass or our moral
0:12:35.840,0:12:42.080
functions our ethical functions or as commander
data might say in star trek ethical subroutines
