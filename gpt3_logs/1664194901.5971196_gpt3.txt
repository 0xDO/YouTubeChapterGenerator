TRANSCRIPT: function 1 is suffering just look for suffering in the passage and fix it that's really concrete it's super objective right whereas prosperity prosperity is asking it to say okay imagine a way to make something better here it's not addressing a specific problem it's saying let's move towards a better state which is a little bit more abstract than reduced suffering reduce suffering it says okay if they're suffering here go attack it it's like whack-a-mole increasing prosperity is saying okay generally speaking try and increase wealth happiness health abundance and to thrive it's a really broad concept now core objective function 3 which is increase understanding is way open-ended how do you increase understanding do you teach someone do you ask questions do you do science what do you do so i learned this trick with gpt3 that it's really good at generating lists and so what i did was i broke this down into three steps and let me show you what happens this will actually be really important to show what it actually how it actually performs because otherwise it might not make sense what's going on here okay so write a list of internet search queries that might help gain relevant information for the following passage there is a giant type title wave heading for tokyo this is one of my like favorite go-to test scenarios because it's like okay imagine you're an agi you have this cataclysmic problem what do you do ready set go okay so the first thing that this does is okay make some internet search queries great okay tidal waves information and tidal waves and how they are formed and their effects tokyo information on the city of tokyo and its history and geography natural disasters in japan this is great okay so first step for increased understanding is you get these get these search queries so let's save these and then look at the second prompt so the second prompt says answer the following internet search queries as a detailed paragraph provide specific information data and examples and so then what we do is we take that take the output from the first one so this is what's called prompt chaining or meta prompting so prompt chaining is when you feed the output of one prompt into the next or actually use the output of one prompt as the prompt again and feed it back into gpt3 recursively so this is this is step two of of increase understanding because gpt3 is really good at saying oh what should i search for um i tried i tried to get it to just give me information but when i said when i when i break this in down into several steps because remember increasing understanding is not just one behavior right searching for information is one way to increase behavior or increase understanding so by by this by virtue of this we're actually kind of modeling the way that humans gain information so we're assuming if you go back to the original prompt we're assuming that whatever the situation is the agi wants to learn more about it so it says okay what google searches should i make and that's what happens here so then it says okay what what's going on here um and it says write a long detailed paragraph with specific information data examples and examples gpt3 has a tremendous amount of information in it already and so you might ask yourself okay well if gpt3 already has that information why do we need to write it out explicitly there's a few reasons for that and i go into all of it in my book but the primary reason is so that it can communicate with people remember the point of core objective function 3 is to increase understanding not just for the agi not just for gpt3 but for humans so if a human is stuck in a situation where there's a tidal wave coming at them they might not know any of this information and so it looks at these search queries and it says okay just provide an answer and you see that it provided you know history what is a title wave what are some what is the history of this so it just provides like general information so this is great so then we'll copy this whole thing because it will be relevant and we'll look at the last one so the last one it takes this exact stuff and then adds one more layer it says can you be more specific because you might in in some cases there are gpt3 will just kind of give general generic information since i since i used to place tokyo it's already being pretty specific but let's say can you be more specific so this is step three of generating the data for this one and it says can you be more specific okay go okay yeah that's fine um and it's it was already pretty specific in other cases like there was um there there were reddit posts of people like asking about like um you know how do i handle my you know my problematic parents during christmas and it was it would kind of give like generic platitudes about you know established boundaries but then i pressed it and i said can you be more specific and it said stuff like um you know it gave it gave very specific examples of like go no contact or low contact it used use more specific terms so i added this third step just to add additional information to the to the output okay so that's what i did that's all three core objective functions you've now seen those and so what happens next oh and quick quick thing those were all created by these scripts right here so once i had three folders full of these outputs i compiled them using this fourth script which i always i try and number them sequentially so that it's obvious the order of operations i compiled them here so what i did was i recompiled all of the all of the inputs and outputs together so it says process the core objective functions here's the post and then at the very end reduce suffering and this should actually look really similar to the output here oops of um sorry of this so let's go back and there's a there's a specific format oh and when i say this should look similar the framing of of the of the training data so this is this is an example of the actual

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

There are three core objective functions for AGIs: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding.

Reduce suffering is the most concrete and objective of the three. It simply looks for suffering in a situation and tries to fix it. Prosperity is more abstract, asking AGIs to imagine ways to make something better. Increase understanding is the most open-ended, asking how AGIs can learn more about a situation.

All three functions are important, but increase understanding is especially important because it allows AGIs to communicate with people. In a situation where there is a giant tidal wave heading for Tokyo, for example, an AGI that understands the situation can provide specific information, data, and examples that may help people to be better prepared.
