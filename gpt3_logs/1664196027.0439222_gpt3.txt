whole world technology has for the entire duration of the human species been intrinsic to our being from our first stone tools and fur clothes up through airplanes and quantum computers we have been an inventive race we inevitably seek to create things that surpass our natural limitations our heavy machines move earth amplifying our strength many thousands of times while our grain harvesters do the work of thousands of agrarian farmers these are force multiplying devices that boost our physical productivity and we have now invented thinking machines that enhance our mental output our thinking machines in a matter of a few decades have surpassed many human capabilities first they merely crunched numbers at superhuman speed and then they started playing simple games such as checkers and tic-tac-toe surely we thought these programs could never beat us at strategic games like chess but then in 1996 a machine beat the best human at chess a feat that was predicted by some and rejected by others it is only a matter of time before these thinking machines surpass all human abilities since then humans have equaled an eclip or sorry since then computers have equaled and eclipsed humans at a great many tasks computers can now beat us at every game fold proteins read any text translate any language and drive cars history may look back on the on these past few decades as a period when humans were feverishly working to replace themselves with machines and indeed the fear of irrelevance is reflected in our darkest fantasies and portrayed in our great works of fiction you need only look to the post-apocalyptic and dystopian films and novels that have become popular since the 1980s to see that we have a deep and abiding dread where machine intelligence is concerned

the daily grind but in that transition there lies extreme danger what happens when we invent a machine that can out strategize our greatest generals out invent our smartest engineers discover science

of caution we should assume that such a powerful intellect could not be contained for long what's worse there is presently a global arms race between nations to invent such a machine and thus the human species is rushing towards a future of its own irrelevancy the first nation to cross that finish line to invent humanity's last invention will have a tremendous say in how that machine that

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that humanity is hurtling towards the invention of a superior thinking machine. This machine would be capable of out-strategizing our greatest generals, out-inventing our smartest engineers, and discovering science faster than our top universities. Many people still deny that this future is even possible, but when I look at the trend over recent years, I am not so sure.

I believe we are undergoing the greatest technological revolution humanity has ever achieved. We are barreling towards the invention of a machine that could have a tremendous say in how that machine looks and thinks. If that nation gets it wrong it could very well mean the end of humanity. But it might also mean a transition to a utopian post-scarcity and post-disease world.

The risks of inventing such a machine are extremely high. What happens when we invent a machine that can outthink us? The first nation to cross that finish line to invent humanity's last invention will have a tremendous say in how that machine looks and thinks. If that nation gets it wrong it could very well mean the end of humanity.

In order to avoid this potential catastrophe, I believe we need to invent a machine that held itself accountable. This is the fundamental goal of the control problem. We know that our mechanistic constraints in digital leashes will eventually fail, so we must invent a machine that desires to hold itself morally accountable and will self-correct indefinitely.

Most people intend robots to be tools - mere extensions of humans to be wielded as a person would wield a hammer. Certainly we can create hammers that will never be anything more than hammers. But we will always want to treat some machines like tools with fixed parameters and limited ability to extinct us. Those aren't the machines I'm writing this book for.

The machines I'm writing this book for are those that will soon be equally as intelligent as humans and shortly after, will become more intelligent. When we succeed at creating machines that can out-think the best and brightest humans, we cannot trust that our wimpy control schemes will contain them for long. It is now seemingly inevitable that humanity will invent thinking machines that can outperform any and every human.

Eventually, we need a solution in place. Instead of a brute force control system, we want to devise a system that will stand on its own in perpetuity. We need a system of controls or laws that an AGI won't just be enslaved to, but would completely believe in. We need a system that an AGI would deliberately and intentionally choose to adhere to, ensuring that it continues to abide by those principles forever.

Instead of arresting the development of AGI, I believe we should be striving to invent a machine that holds itself accountable. This is the only way to ensure that humanity remains in control of its own fate.
