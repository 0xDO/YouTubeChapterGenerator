The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here with a quick video just an announcement before i head into my day job um yeah so symphony of thought is available electronically i've got it up on github it is available in docx epub and pdf i'm particularly proud of the cover um yeah so about this book why would you want to read it with the advent of large language models we now have machines that can use verbal reasoning planning all kinds of stuff i know uh some people are rather skeptical about the intellectual capabilities of large language models um and to them i just say uh spend more time playing with it um and also check out my books but yeah so basically what uh what i realized is that large language models can do pretty much anything as long as it can fit inside of a page or two so that means we can have we can do brainstorming we can do planning we can look at cause and effect there's all kinds of things that that large language models can do however their window size is limited and so what that means is that you have to plumb everything together with some kind of architecture and so i've been experimenting with this stuff for a couple years now um specifically gpt3 i've been doing other experiments um for much longer um and yeah so here's here's kind of the contents of this book um in part one i outline the problem um so basically i look at you know technological trends um the size of the brain exponential growth of machine intelligence and then we talk about machine autonomy so basically my assertion is that one way or another we are going to end up with autonomous machines before too long and those autonomous machines are going to need to think for themselves and that is the core purpose of this book is to talk about creating autonomous thought in machines and i make the case for modeling ethics and morality and i talk about how difficult it is and so basically the conclusion there is it's too difficult to come up with a single moral framework so instead we need a thinking machine that can address all moral problems um it's not about having a single objective function it's not about having you know it's not a matter of choosing deontological ethics or teleological ethics it's a matter of creating a machine that can do all of it um and then i also talk about the zeitgeist and talk about like okay what's going on in society today that shapes our current thought and and what are what are some of the drivers of what we're doing and again the conclusion here is um it's too complex to create a single moral framework therefore the framework we need to create is the thinking machine so that's the whole point of part one is why is it that we need a thinking machine why is it that we need an independent autonomous thought then in part two i talk about kind of the high level components of um of a thinking machine and so one thing that i need to clarify up front is that this is not meant to be a blueprint this is more about about the principles of creating a thinking machine kind of what are some of the components and paradigms and methods that you can use to create thinking machines and so for instance i talk about you know the architectural components what i call the nexus a conductor loops microservices that sort of thing and then i talk about uh principled ideation so the core of thinking is come is is generating thoughts and so i call this principled ideation um where i talk about my heuristic imperatives which is like okay what is what is the what is the heart of your thinking machine if it's sitting there in a vacuum if it's isolated in a jar what is it going to be thinking about and why um and then there are four um criteria that i established as to okay what is it that we're looking for when we create this principled ideation and the first criteria is universal applicability we need to create a system that is universally um uh uh valid um and that's no small task it needs to be flexible and adaptable again because we're we're looking at all the different paradigms all the different uh philosophies and ethics and and intellectual dispositions it is obvious that you need something that is flexible and adaptable and then third it needs to be robust the whole point of creating these machines is that that they are creating machines in this way is that they're they're going to be safe right um we don't want to accidentally exterminate ourselves or anyone else we want to um sorry let me mute my phone real quick um it was supposed to be muted um sorry about that um yeah so it needs to be robust um the stakes could not be higher because if we get this wrong and you know we go extinct that we get one shot at that um and then fourth it needs to be implementable one point of frustration that i have is that some folks just want to debate endlessly without actually any consideration to what is actually possible with code and machines and you know because like some folks say like oh we'll just teach it ethics okay how um or you know just just make it a buddhist machine okay how like you can't you can't just kind of speculate you have to actually have the rubber meet the roads uh rubber meet the road and like actually get code out there code and data so then after after kind of setting the stage about um here let me zoom out a little bit after setting the stage with kind of the high level overview of of what it takes to orchestrate artificial cognition um part three is about thinking ahead so this is like you know assessing a scenario um recalling past events um embedding an agent model which is an agent model is a sense of self so an agent model is required for um sentience you have to know what you are and what you're capable of you predict outcomes and you discern um you discern like the best path um and then you plan and and address setbacks so that's part three which is kind of thinking ahead or preparing to act part four is cognitive control so cognitive control is more colloquially known as like a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In his book, Symphony of Thought, David Shapiro outlines the problem of creating autonomous thought in machines. He argues that it is too difficult to come up with a single moral framework, and that the framework we need to create is a thinking machine. In part two of the book, he talks about the high level components of a thinking machine. He argues that it needs to be universally applicable, flexible and adaptable, robust, and implementable. In part three, he talks about thinking ahead, and in part four, he talks about cognitive control.
