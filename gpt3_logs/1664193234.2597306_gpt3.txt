The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: educate them you don't have to stuff facts into them they will drink it in and children are way more curious than we give them credit for because we're so obsessed with grades so imagine you have something that can handle questions like this like um you know children are going to ask superlatives like you know what what is the fastest thing ever right this is um all children go through a phase or at least i did um and a lot of kids go through a phase where they want to know like what's the biggest what's the fastest what's the smallest because they're trying to get an understanding of the world and just imagine if you could respond to a child's curiosity and always meet them where they are so i wanted to point out something while this is finishing up we're at 173 while we're finishing up if you take several prompts you know like one that's geared towards children one that's geared towards academics you know one different different prompts different versions of tim that um that are calibrated for different levels of explanation then then and you put all that into the fine-tune set then the fine-tuned bot and at the end will actually be able to adapt and so if if it senses that the user is asking like really basic questions it'll give basic answers if if the user is asking you know more and more sophisticated questions it'll give more sophisticated answers i don't feel like i well let me test it because i think there's some possibility here i might have to ultimately make a follow-up video where i extend these conversations because and also merge in multiple prompts because i have i have some suspicion that there's a lot of value here um you can play with it yourself this is all under the mit license um but yeah let's see uh 182 yep but yeah so let me just show you an example so this one is dna and rna so imagine you've got you know a seventh grader who just you know in biology they're talking about like dna and rna and they're just not getting it they're like okay um what you know what's the difference so you see here where it says what's your question rather than launching into something this is great this is why i love gbt3 is because it has this it has in its brain somewhere the model of a good educator which is to open with a question or to lead with questions and so it just says okay what's your query what's the difference between dna and rna and it gives a very very straightforward answer dna is double stranded and rna is single single-stranded dna is made up of deoxyribonucleate nucleotides while rna is made up of ribonucleotides uh dna contains the sugar deoxyribose while rna contains the sugar ribose okay that makes sense but why does that matter look at that such a great question the difference in structure between dna and rna affects their function dna is responsible for storing genetic information well rna is responsible for translating that information into proteins and so you can imagine this conversation going and this would allow a student to really kind of understand what's the difference like where is like a follow-up question this could be like okay well how does rna code proteins right or how does dna store genetic information and that'll just lead to so many things because when you respond so here's what happens in someone's brain i've read books about this this is why i know if you're having a conversation with someone one human brains are finally calibrated to learn via conversation um not just passive listening but conversation um i i remember realizing many many years ago that if i talk to an expert i learn really fast and then i was i was greatly validated when elon musk as controversial as he is said the same thing in order to learn um one thing that elon musk does is he'll find an expert and just talk to them for an hour because what happens is when you ask the question that's generated by your own brain that's your brain's model saying okay what's this missing puzzle piece and then you fill that in and then you know it's like okay what's the next piece that i'm missing and you fill that in when you when it's a dialogue and this is this is why classical education like way back in the greek era and roman times this is why education was centered on dialogues between a master and a student so when you when you're responding to your own curiosity that's because that's literally your brain saying okay i'm ready for the next piece this is the piece that i want i'm ready for the next piece however when you're just passively listening one you're not engaged your brain waves literally change when you're when you're just kind of passively listening versus when you're actively engaged so your brain is functioning differently but also the teacher is trying to hand out puzzle pieces one at a time in an order that generally might make sense um but again that between because it's passive and there's no dialogue um you know a lecture-based uh learning usually like it's just it's super sub-optimal um okay sorry okay we're done cool so time to uh time to format the data uh so that would be uh let's see what was the name of that script um that was format training data so let's just do oops if i can type python format okay so let's make sure this generated oh it called it eve i need to update that as well hey tim i'm interested in ancient greece can you tell me more about it of course ancient greece is a fascinating topic okay that looks good um let me change the name because this is eve was the last project so we'll call this tim some call me tim also yeah i don't have a human to look at i just have a camera and the camera is super non-judgmental so like i'm weird you're getting unfiltered dave um all right uh let's see format training data let's update this so that the name is tim tim okay so let's rerun this make sure that everything is correct so that should be tim.jsonl and it just updated yep make sure that eve does not appear um eve does appear hmm how many times does eve

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to educate children effectively, you don't have to stuff facts into them. They will drink in information if you present it in an interesting way. Children are much more curious than we give them credit for, and they are constantly trying to understand the world around them.

If you take several prompts and put them into the fine-tuned bot, it will be able to adapt to the user's level of understanding. For example, if a child asks a basic question, the bot will give a basic answer. But if the child asks a more sophisticated question, the bot will give a more sophisticated answer.

This is all under the MIT license, but you can play with it yourself to see the value in this type of educational tool.
