==========

Alyssia is looking out the window when she sees some butterflies and pigeons. Suddenly her old tortoise shell kitten appears and startles her. Alyssia's sister calls her from the outside and Alyssia climbs into the study to find the kitten.

Next, Alyssia's uncle asks her about the book she's been reading. Alyssia tells him it's about a princess in a castle, a knight, a dragon, a wicked witch, and a good fairy. Uncle is curious about the book and asks Alyssia where she found it.
