0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:09.180,0:04:14.520
um so there's all kinds of procedural stuff that
I don't even remember but there's there you know
0:04:14.520,0:04:20.760
uh the idea is that when you have rule by law
it is all about procedure and protocol rather
0:04:20.760,0:04:25.020
than emotions so we actually have a very stoic
system where it's we're going to think through
0:04:25.020,0:04:28.320
this we're going to look at the letter of the
law we're going to have an impartial system
0:04:29.340,0:04:34.440
um of course when you have an impartial
system that requires expert navigation that
0:04:34.440,0:04:39.000
automatically privileges people with access
to lawyers AKA people with training or money
0:04:39.720,0:04:45.120
privilege is a whole other topic anyways
the system is there it's a very sober system
0:04:46.020,0:04:51.000
um where it's about like let's let's let's read
through the established protocols if you're a
0:04:51.000,0:04:56.700
friend of the court and stuff I watch legal eagle
too legal eagle is great um so anyways all that
0:04:56.700,0:05:04.020
kind of stuff that's fine but interpreting
established law common law uh or case law is
0:05:04.020,0:05:09.660
a whole is a very specific topic so let's take
antitrust law where uh let's see how many did
0:05:09.660,0:05:16.320
it say Anti-Trust so there's 362 documents they're
all available online as PDFs they've been scanned
0:05:16.320,0:05:21.540
and I believe they've also all been ocr'd so
let's take a quick look close some of these
0:05:21.540,0:05:28.680
um Superfluous ones um yeah so PDF 661 um yeah
you don't have something that's this long and
0:05:28.680,0:05:33.960
yeah so you you highlight it you see that it's
OCR so that means we should be able to scrape it
0:05:33.960,0:05:38.880
even though it was scanned excuse me a scanned an
ocr'd so we should be able to get this information
0:05:39.840,0:05:47.100
so let me go ahead over here to uh opinions
opinions PDF so we'll save this one
0:05:48.300,0:05:53.460
um and then actually what I put it in the wrong
folder so you might have seen I had a recent
0:05:53.460,0:06:02.040
document scraping uh video so this is whoops come
back this is uh this is the lead up to that this
0:06:02.040,0:06:07.920
is why you need something like document scraping
is because um oh I forgot to the the whole reason
0:06:07.920,0:06:15.240
this is is uh I went and asked uh chat GPT say
tell me about this this this case law and it said
0:06:15.240,0:06:19.320
I don't know what you're talking about this sounds
like it's a real case so it's like okay cool
0:06:20.400,0:06:25.500
um you know it tells me about the identification
I said it was a Supreme Court case decided in
0:06:25.500,0:06:31.080
1953 it still doesn't know it right because it's
not connected to any external data source so one
0:06:31.080,0:06:36.180
of the biggest weaknesses of chat GPT is that
it's a mind in a bottle it has no contact with
0:06:36.180,0:06:41.940
the outside world the only way that chat GPT can
interact with anything is via this chat interface
0:06:41.940,0:06:48.420
now from an architectural standpoint that's not
actually that difficult to fix but you introduce
0:06:48.420,0:06:53.820
a whole lot of new problems especially when you
consider the fact that there are like billions
0:06:53.820,0:06:59.400
of terabytes of text Data out there to search and
a lot of it isn't accessible because it's in PDFs
0:06:59.400,0:07:04.620
or private databases or something so you need
to have a link between the model the language
0:07:04.620,0:07:09.180
model which can read anything and then the stuff
that you want it to read so that's what we're
0:07:09.180,0:07:14.100
working on here okay so now that you're caught
up I wanted to show this is this is one of the
0:07:14.100,0:07:20.880
greatest flaws of chat GPT it's not connected to
anything it's in a vacuum Okay cool so now what
0:07:20.880,0:07:26.580
well we've got our data here it's in text but
it's not necessarily machine readable so the
0:07:26.580,0:07:34.620
first thing we got to do is we've got to go over
here we've got to take our um take our PDF and
0:07:34.620,0:07:39.900
then we'll use this script that I wrote here let
me just show it to you real quick um uh so it
0:07:39.900,0:07:45.660
just takes everything in the folder PDFs and then
converts it so let me go ahead and just run this
0:07:47.400,0:07:53.520
it should go pretty quick and then we'll look
at converted so here it is Tada there we go so
0:07:53.520,0:07:58.620
you've got and this this repo is public by
the way so you've got this oh and one thing
0:07:58.620,0:08:04.680
that I did was I added a little thing so that it
keeps the new pages I actually might remove that
