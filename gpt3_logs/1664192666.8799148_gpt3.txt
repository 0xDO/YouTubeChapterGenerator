TRANSCRIPT: that's a lot of generations so anyways that's that's kind of how i got started back in 2009 and then i kind of cyclically came back to it um so for instance uh you know a couple years later i wanted to do algorithmic trading on the stock market so i learned i picked up python and scikit-learn and that's where i learned clustering that sort of stuff um let's see okay so vulnerable growth you asked a question earlier about how to come up with experiments so that's actually a good question um the way that i come up with experiments is everything that i do almost everything that i do is geared towards my ultimate goal of creating artificial cognition um so what do i mean by artificial cognition um the the the deficit or the the prevailing thing of artificial general intelligence which is you know a machine that can learn anything right okay that's fine i don't i don't like that that idea because intelligence is so hard to define anyways um and so like the goal post is always moving on it and so rather than say that intelligence is the goal i realize that i need to set cognition as the goal we want a machine that thinks a machine that has agency and autonomy and then intelligence is a characteristic of what you're measuring or is a way to measure how intelligent the machine is that you've built um but you start with cognition so that basically a few years ago i think it was about 2017 is when i started to come up with these ideas i realized that that intelligence or or ai or autonomous machines would be a thought first approach rather than a robotics first approach so um you might know the uh honda's robot asamo right that came out like 20 years ago now and they put hardware first and then it just stood there and it did a few tricks and you know but everything had to be hard-coded and then boston dynamics they got much better at the hardware where you know now it can navigate and stuff but it has no thought right and i realized like you can have the best robotics platform in the world but if they can't think it doesn't matter um and so i started realizing we need to focus on instead of bottom up like let's build a robot and then give it a brain no let's build a brain and then give it a robot right and so i started with thought first as the goal and so back in about 2017 2018 i came up with the idea of muragi which is a acronym m-a-r-a-g-i uh microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence um where i put thought first and um so i started with those ideas um and but that was around the time that like you know a universe google's universal sentence encoder was out which is a good component i'll still be using that but it's not enough it's necessary but not sufficient is the uh is the uh like engineering term it is it is a necessary component but not sufficient to fully realize artificial cognition then gp2 came out i started experimenting with that and said okay we're closer then gpt3 came out and i was like now we're cooking with fire um so everything that i do on my channel um like whether it's search or something uh basically what i realized is that i needed to solve other problems of cognition um and so i read i mean you see my bookcase i've got a couple shelves full of psychology neuroscience and philosophy books um and so i have a pretty good understand well i say pretty good understanding like we don't know how the human brain works um but in in terms of what people do understand today i've got a decent understanding of how the brain works how the mind works um how cognition works and and how neuroscience works and so everything that that i do on my channel are experiments to build up the skills and knowledge and abilities to solve those problems so for instance if you look at um one of my videos uh where uh i did i did search right i did question answering for um what was it the roe vs wade decision that came out um you know on the one hand like yes it's a cool project to be able to like here's a document provide answers from it but if you if you go back even further in my youtube history and look at my uh my natural language cognitive architecture question generator that was that the entire reason that i fine-tuned a question generator was so that the machine could have an internal sense of curiosity so the long story short all of my experiments in some way either contribute directly to or help teach me how to build artificial cognition so um basically like everything is like you know building blocks reaching up towards this higher goal so that's that's the answer to that vulnerable growth um let's see let's see jw says i'm in my early 20s lost my job i would love to find a way to live off my gpt projects i'm obsessed with gbt and gpt and python but i need some help to figure out how to survive till my projects are ready okay so you are actually probably in well i'm not going to make any promises you might be in better shape than you realize um one reason is because um the the job market is going to be slow to adapt if you look for large language model jobs most places are still hiring you know senior data scientists with a phd um in you know in in nlp and the thing is is i've talked to a bunch of people and there are nlp experts like i've had lunch with people in my local area who are you know old school nlp experts and they don't know anything about large language models or how to use gpt3 it's strange we're in a very weird place where these these technologies large language models like gpt and then all the open source versions from luther there are plenty of people who are you know experts in the field who have no idea how to use these um so you by being younger and more flexible and able to ride with the current i will say master the open source ones um because there are plenty of people who are saying like okay well you know open ai is too expensive but you know i can run gptj on my own hardware now so i'm gonna do that right or gpt um neox or bloom is

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In 2009, I got started in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of creating artificial cognition. This means creating a machine that thinks and has agency and autonomy. Over the years, I have experimented with different approaches and technologies to further this goal.

Currently, I am focusing on large language models such as GPT-3. I believe these are key to creating artificial cognition. I am also reading up on psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy to better understand how the mind works.

Everything I do on my YouTube channel is aimed at either directly contributing to or helping me learn how to build artificial cognition. For example, my video on the Roe vs. Wade decision is not just a cool project â€“ it is also helping me fine-tune a question generator, which is an important component of artificial cognition.

As someone who is early in their career, I believe I am in a good position to capitalize on these technologies. The job market is slow to adapt, but there is still demand for experts in this field. I encourage others in my position to master the open source versions of these technologies.
