The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: [Music] foreign here for a video so today we are going to do auto Muse blogger so rather than generating long format fiction we're going to generate blog posts now before we get started before we get started um I have to warn you that one this use case if you were to try and just do this and put it directly online that is against open ai's policies so don't do this this is for research purposes only now that being said you are allowed as far as I know you are allowed to use AI to generate content as long as you then put human eyes on it to like edit it clean it up make sure that it's safe and then also I think part of the EULA requires that you say this was written by AI I think obviously check with uh check with open AI before going live on any apps that do this kind of thing but that being said um lots and lots of folks have wanted blogs and I've just had this turning in the back of my head so we will uh we will take a stab at this now also um I posted a poll on YouTube and the results were overwhelming y'all want to have um fewer videos but higher quality videos it was overwhelming so um stay tuned this is going to be my first one where I'll do some editing after the fact and uh and we'll go from there because I've also got the chapters right I figured out how to automatically do chapters with uh with gpt3 all right so all that out of the way let's get started first um when I when I'm starting a project like this um what I've started doing is kind of brainstorming getting my thoughts out because then I have a template to follow um oftentimes you see me rely on intuition and intuition is good and it works much of the time but not always and plus it's also not something that I can just tell you like use your intuition so let's actually do a process so what we're going to do is just brainstorm okay what it what do we think this is actually going to do so first we're going to say take a prompt of some sort natural and natural language instructions like I want to blog about X um brainstorm the structure of the request so um if you just ask instruct series to write it'll start writing I mean gpt3 generative pre-trained model is generative it will write but one thing that it doesn't do is it doesn't necessarily think about structure um and so given whatever the um the input is let's think about um the best way to do it uh So like um uh let's see like maybe list um a bunch of sections and then what we can do is we can probably iterate on that list to improve it um like is this a good list oops um okay so then once we have a list of sections um then we can say okay uh okay what after we have the sections then do we just start writing or do we do some research probably we'll do some research um uh let's see uh brainstorm um some interesting uh like some facts or points to include for each section yeah and then let's see and also we're gonna keep we're going to keep this in mind the whole time right so let's just bold that um okay so then we got some lists and points and then we actually want to write the thing um okay so then we'll write the actual sections um and then six uh iterate improve the sections and then done and I okay so that's where we'll start um I'm not going to dive into automatically pulling from external sources for this one for this we're going to start with something simple because gpt3 already knows a lot um but perhaps in a future version or a different kind of thing I might explore like an automatic Knowledge Graph Builder um because that's something I've wanted to do anyways but for for the for the sake of this one we're just going to assume that gpt3 already has the information built embedded in it somewhere because it's already read a lot of news and Reddit and Wikipedia and stuff so the topic that I was going to do um was going to be Shinto in Japan because I'm reading a book about Japanese history and culture so it's something that I happen to know a little bit about and of course like gpt3 has already read all of Wikipedia on all of these things so I'm going to assume that it has enough knowledge to do this so first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to the playground and we will say um so basically we're going to start with some prompt engineering I'll say um uh let's see um write a blog outline write a killer blog outline for the following request from a customer okay requests um I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and Corey gates in Japan like I'm basically adopting the percent of like a surfer bro like uh how did they come up with that idea what does it mean um and let's see and what are the coolest ones to see I'm going to Japan next summer because I'm a weeb sorry um I have a bunch of friends who are uh was it xenophile would be China what do you call it if someone is like an actual term if someone is obsessed with Japan they're into an anime and stuff I used to be in high school my my high school girlfriend got me into anime and I was into it for like 10 years and then I kind of like got over it I'm still a nerd I'm not trying to defend that okay write a killer blog uh outline for the following uh request from a customer all right so the request is this okay so now um brainstorm a list of sections for this blog post um each section uh let's see uh let's see the outline should meet the customers requests and each section should be let's say highly descriptive provide a paragraph explaining what should go should go into each section okay so then we'll do sections and we'll start with one so one thing that I do you'll notice uh often that I'll do all caps lock for for these things what that does it's very similar to what it does for humans so for humans it draws your eye to or you're like okay cool this is like a thing that I need to pay attention to but also it's a different set of tokens it's new it's represented differently inside of gpt3 which allows it to kind of notice oh this isn't just the word request this is capital r request

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, we'll be generating blog posts using OpenAI's GPT-3 model. However, before we get started, I need to warn you that attempting to use this content directly online is against OpenAI's policies. This is for research purposes only. With that being said, you are allowed to use AI to generate content, as long as you then put human eyes on it to edit it, clean it up, and make sure it is safe. You are also required to say that the content was written by AI. With that out of the way, let's get started.

First, when I am starting a project like this, I brainstorm to get my thoughts out because then I have a template to follow. Oftentimes, you'll see me rely on intuition, but it's not always reliable, so it's important to have a process.

For this project, we will take a prompt of some sort and brainstorm the structure of the request. Then, we will list a series of sections and brainstorm some interesting facts or points to include for each section. Once we have a list of sections and points, we will write the actual sections and iterate to improve them.

The topic that I have chosen for this blog post is Shinto in Japan. I've chosen this topic because I am reading a book about Japanese history and culture. I am assuming that GPT-3 already has enough knowledge to write about this topic, as it has read a lot of news, Reddit, and Wikipedia.

In the playground, we will start with some prompt engineering. I will say, "Write a blog outline for the following request from a customer: I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and Corey gates in Japan."

Then, we will brainstorm a list of sections for this blog post. Each section should be highly descriptive and provide a paragraph explaining what should go into each section.

Once we have a list of sections, we will write the actual sections and iterate to improve them. And that's it!
