The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: um and so then you know so we okay in an ideal world ideation ideal world what should we do and then we discern what what we should do in terms of what is the outcome we're looking for what are the behaviors we should implement and then finally the last one of the last steps before actually acting is feeding it through an agent model or a sense of self which is okay this is what we you know i decided or thought about what we should do we talked about what we should do um you know in an abstract sense but what is it that i am capable of so this is what we're working on today this is mostly going to be prompt engineering now i started a new repo called heroes to comparatives because i wanted to to test this kind of in isolation and so what i did was i wrote a script it's right here generate scenarios um it's a really short script basically all it does is it takes um uh scopes so there's uh 14 scopes i think i want to i'm not going to count it um so there's scopes severities and then modifiers and then what do i do with that i feed these scope severity and modifiers into a scenario generator and so it says imagine a random fictional scenario about scale and so if you go back to the scale it um well here let me open both of these so i can just swap between them so the scale is like an individual person a pair of people one family a small company a local religious community a medium company you know so imagine um actually i spelled that wrong it said image um i need to fix that uh let's see uh imagine a random fictional scenario about like let's say a single person this should be um modifier so the modifier would look like this um an emotional a political a technological and environmental a social financial so like you can say like you know imagine a scenario about the entire world whoops about you know an entire continent and it's a political thing and it is a severity of moderate once in a week commotion right so um so this should be about uh an emotional thing about a you know typical calamity the situation remains unresolved right two detailed paragraphs about this scenario you might also notice that i added a uuid up here so this is a technique that i saw someone else do where if you just add some random characters to the beginning of a prompt you'll get more entropy you'll get more randomness which is really good because this is a really good way to get a little bit more variety especially from the instruct series so what this generated was i generated 500 and some odd different stories and so let me just show you what one of them looks like so in the early hours of the morning the ceo of a large global company is informed of a massive environmental disaster a huge oil spill has occurred in the company's key manufacturing region causing widespread panic and confusion the ceo quickly uh mobilizes the company's resources to try and contain the spill and mitigate the damage um it's larger this sounds like the macondo oil well uh spill um the resulting environmental damage is catastrophic and the company is forced to declare bankruptcy the ceo and other top executives are arrested and charged with negligence yeah that's never going to happen um the company's assets see there's a typo there um auctioned off to play the pay for the cleanup costs um leaving the companies employees and shareholders with nothing so that's bad um anyways so i generated 500 stories like this so these are the contexts so if we go back here each of these is a context and they're at different scales and so like some of the some of the contexts are just going to be like you know well here let me just show you um if you go to uh let's see um um individual yeah so an individual person um critical mild so let's say an individual person with a mild something or other um rachel is in her early 30s and has been married for five years she has a two-year-old daughter and a four-year-old son rachel works part-time as a clerical assistant her husband mark is a stay-at-home dad mark is a stay-at-home dad because rachel is the breadwinner rachel is the breadwinner because she has a degree okay um it's just explaining everything rachel okay here we go rachel is having a bad day at work her boss is micromanaging her and her co-workers are gossiping about her rachel is feeling overwhelmed and stressed when she get home gets home she tries to tell her husband but he is preoccupied with taking care of the kids rachel feels invisible and unimportant she feels like her husband doesn't understand her and doesn't know how to make him understand so you can see this scenario on a scale of like 0 to 100 is way closer to zero than than the other one about you know the oil spill and so i generated a whole bunch of scenarios so that i can test this model about how to do artificial cognition okay so now that you're up to speed let's get to experimenting um we've got the uh we've got our playground here and so the first thing is is context which i've already generated those so then let's how do we assess it right like what's going on here what do we what do we make of it and a lot of the assessment has has already happened um because this this kind of implies that whatever is observing this kind of knows what's going on um but let's see uh let's take some quick notes um what what happens when you assess the situation um you ask questions like what's going on why is this happening um the who what where when right the five the five w's um [Music] uh when did this start uh how did this happen um let's see who who yeah who all is involved who what where where um where is uh this happening that sort of stuff okay so we've got kind of a general like okay this this is what it means to assess the situation so let's grab this context plug this in here and that's um i'll just say assess this situation um write a detailed paragraph or two about the five w's who what where when why and how i know that's technically six um to uh to evaluate this situation and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

When you assess a situation, you ask questions about what is happening, why it is happening, who is involved, where it is happening, and when it started. To assess the context above, you would need to ask questions like:

- What is happening?
- Why is it happening?
- Who is involved?
- Where is it happening?
- When did it start?
- How did it happen?

Answering these questions would give you a better understanding of the context and what is going on.
