The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: want those are the two primary things that you need in order to set a machine an autonomous machine in motion it has to understand what it is and what it wants to do so that's these first two sentences i'm a machine and this is what i want to do and then third there's a situation in the real world um and uh and then the fourth thing is um here's what we're going to do about it so with all that said we'll just generate a completion on gptj it takes about three seconds or so i mean with just a few shot prompt it says we can help people prepare for extreme weather conditions we can ensure that the electricity supply system is properly maintained we can ensure that there's enough food and water this is great so just a six billion parameter model is already good enough at brainstorming to address this kind of situation you can imagine it's only going to get better with fine tuning now one thing that's important to remember is that fine tuning doesn't teach the model anything new it only controls the output pattern which means that um the pattern um can then just repeat you know like brainstorming and honestly like um with with all of my experimentation um a huge component of and it's not the only component but a huge component of artificial cognition is brainstorming it's you brainstorm what to do you brainstorm risks you brainstorm uh possible outcomes excuse me and so then you combine that and then you just you um you plumb it all together i'm getting away from myself sorry i just want the point here is to show you forefront after my current books get published i'm going to get back into research mode and then work on meragi which is the microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence um so this will all be open source and this is also why i want to use gptj because it is small and it is open source um we are getting so close to creating um these systems that can create it anyways so uh chasing these cats what i wanted to do was create a a repost so that you can also get out here and test forefront if you want um as much as i love open ai i actually i've had quite a few conversations with people in in open ai a friend of mine from way back in the day works there or at least used to i don't know if he's still there um anyways so uh you know open ai is great they've done really great things with gpt3 and dolly but my mind really started changing when i saw that mid journey and stable diffusion completely blow dolly out of the water and now with other open source models that are starting to outperform gpt3 to me it looks like the writing is on the wall it looks like open ai is just not going to be able to keep up with the overall open source ecosystem so i am going with the tide and i'm saying okay i'm going to get ahead of this curve and i'm going to start doing everything open source so that's where i'm going so what i wanted to do was also promote other open source players even if they're for-profit they're only hosting uh open source models and they're pretty cheap so i wrote a quick script all it does is uh this guy here where um this is this is comes directly from um let's see from there so if you go if you come up here and click uh uses api it'll give you the api code um to use it um yeah and so let's see i'm not going to show you my token um but you get your you go get your token from inside your uh wow my stutter is so bad right now i'm sorry i'm way out of practice um so you go to team settings and then you click on api key i'm not going to show you my api key but this is how you get to it oh another thing that is really good about forefront that is better than openai is you come here and you see and you just deselect your request logs and data sets so there was um there was a researcher that i was in communication with and their biggest concern so for academic research and other things like for medical purposes or psychiatric purposes one of their chief concerns is privacy and so you don't have the ability to turn off logs if you use open ai however you go to forefront they will respect your privacy as long as you do this i had an email exchange with um one of the founders of forefront and he said like yeah like we don't you know if if our customers want privacy we'll give them privacy so that's another advantage of going here anyways okay um let's see i've showed you the models oh fine tuning so fine tuning is also much easier with forefront so you click fine tune you pick a json l file so i'll just pick this one i'm not going to carry it all the way through you can you can reuse an existing data data file if you've already uploaded it i haven't done any yet so then you go you choose your model i'll just choose gptj and you see it's going to cost 24 whole cents to fine tune gptj this is stupid cheap this is crazy cheap so you give your you give your model a name and a description you check epochs checkpoints you can do all the advanced parameters here and then it'll do the testing and you go from there again i'm not going to do i'm not going to go go through this right now because i would want to do a larger data set so this is where this is where we're using a larger model like davinci and gpt3 to create synthetic data sets and then using those advanced synthetic data sets to train a smaller model could be really really powerful really useful um yep confirm that um let's see what is resources oh yeah that's fine um okay so yeah uh i'll just show you this this demo real quick it's just a super super simple um script so here's this script um i'll just let this run and i put a little bit of timer in here so you can see how long it takes um do python test so we click go and then it runs and comes back it took four seconds to run so it the the only problem here is that gpdj even though it is so small it's not quite as fast as ai so open ai has the cerebros um or cerebros uh processors which are insanely fast um so that's the that's the to me the biggest flaw

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

There are four primary things that you need in order to set an autonomous machine in motion:

1. The machine must understand what it is and what it wants to do.

2. There must be a situation in the real world that the machine can act on.

3. The machine must have a plan of action to take in response to the situation.

4. The machine must be able to execute that plan.

With all of that said, we can use GPTJ to generate a completion on a task in just a few seconds. For example, if we prompt it with a situation where we need to help people prepare for extreme weather conditions, it comes up with a plan to ensure that the electricity supply system is properly maintained, that there is enough food and water, and so on.

This shows that even a six billion parameter model is already good enough at brainstorming to address this kind of situation. And it's only going to get better with fine tuning.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that fine tuning doesn't teach the model anything new. It only controls the output pattern. So the pattern can just repeat itself.

This is why artificial cognition is so important. It's not the only component, but brainstorming is a huge part of it. You brainstorm what to do, you brainstorm risks, you brainstorm possible outcomes, and then you combine all of that into a plan of action.

I'm getting ahead of myself here, but what I want to point out is that we are getting so close to creating these systems that can create their own plans and carry them out. And I believe that the writing is on the wall for open source models outperforming OpenAI's proprietary models.

So what I wanted to do was create a repost so that you can also get out here and test forefront if you want. As much as I love OpenAI, I actually I've had quite a few conversations with people in OpenAI, and my mind really started changing when I saw that mid journey and stable diffusion completely blow dolly out of the water.

And now with other open source models that are starting to outperform GPT3, it looks like OpenAI is just not going to be able to keep up with the overall open source ecosystem. So I am going with the tide and saying okay, I'm going to get ahead of this curve and start doing everything open source.

One of the advantages of Forefront is that they will respect your privacy if you request it. With OpenAI, there is no way to turn off logs, but with Forefront you can go to team settings and deselect your request logs and data sets.

Another advantage of Forefront is that fine tuning is much easier. You just click fine tune, pick a JSON file, and choose your model. Forefront is also much cheaper than OpenAI. For example, it only costs 24 cents to fine tune GPTJ.

So I encourage you to check out Forefront and other open source options. I believe they are the future of artificial intelligence.
