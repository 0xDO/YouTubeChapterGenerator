TRANSCRIPT: saying one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your pros and style you know let's let's do this i also might switch to an older model because the original instruct beta tends to be a little bit better with creativity so let's try this and if it if it does the lists again we'll go back to instruct beta and see how that works um okay wait wait wait wait wait cancel i need to do the uh prepare prompts cd creative writing coach uh python prepare prompt um check to make sure the prompts look right delete the completions i will provide you critical feedback yes critical okay cool and then oops um python generate okay it's still doing lists let's give it a couple more completions okay it is super fixated on doing lists but the the feedback is much more detailed okay it seems like it's kind of bouncing back like it's it's still giving me numbered lists but they seem to be in more complete paragraphs so let's take a look at these whoops um completions sorry i was like what am i looking for okay so that's a paragraph that's a paragraph that's a pair okay so these are just numbered paragraphs it's kind of gross but we'll go with it um because sometimes it gives you just like yeah and it's so this one about kate about being you know be vivid and detailed show us show us show us so this this feedback is very consistent for this particular story um [Music] um oh i thought of something else so one thing that you're supposed to do with with feedback especially creative writing feedback because it's so personal is there's the compliment sandwich so you're supposed to open with a compliment and close with a compliment um which is basically like this is what you did well um and and then you provide the harsh part in the middle and then you say but also i really liked it right so let me add let's see if we can get that um provide you critical feedback uh um um i will also commend you where you did well um so that should be good i will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your pros and style i will also use the compliment sandwich method of feedback okay so let's see if it let's see if it can follow that all right so we do cd whoops not that one um python prepare prompt python python generate completions and first let's go delete the ones and clear those out delete them it'll overwrite them because all it's doing is it's giving the completion the same file name as the prompt but i want to delete it so that way i don't accidentally get confused alright so make sure the prompt i'll also commend you where you did well okay compliment sandwich because we want this to be good all right generate completions the other because the thing is like if you're gonna so this is this is while this is running um a cardinal rule of thumb oh that's good that looks good okay a cardinal rule of thumb with automation is yes it might feel tedious to like get into the details to make sure it's perfect but once you do automation right okay we've got a few once you do automation right it doesn't matter if you're doing it 100 times or 10 million times if you've got your automation correct it's infinitely reproducible and so that's why i'm so meticulous in these videos and that's why you notice like most of the time is just getting the prep like laying the groundwork because once you get the right prompts once you get the right data that's most of the battle one after that you just let it run and then you fine tune your model and it's good okay so i think i think we've i think we've nailed it let's see i think we got three for three um let's see this was the prompt so we can close that one um let's see the first few sentence for example the sentence still in the high of graduating together with masters from could be rewritten as still writing high the story has good potential but there are few areas that could be improved for example the dialogue could be more natural less stiff additionally the story could be proof read for grammar errors overall this is a strong story with good potential that's not too bad very strong immediately sets a tense and suspenseful tone um i love the descriptions however i felt the story lost a bit of momentum in the middle when kate is exploring the factory might help to focus on one or two key images or scenes rather than trying to describe the whole factory in detail the ending of the story is very effective and the image of the door slamming shut is particularly chilling i think he did a great job building suspension creating a sense of unease in the reader yes so the reason that you also want to commend an author for what they did well is because it's not it's not always obvious what they did well and so when you when you tell someone you did this good it tells them keep that right keep that don't throw that out but fix this other thing so you have to you have to do good and bad right you have to label label the feedback as both good and bad the first thing i noticed was that your story has excellent potential but there are few areas that could use improvement for example your use of description could be more concise and vivid in particular i would recommend using more concrete images and specific details to bring your setting and characters to life additionally your dialogue could be strengthened by adding more natural sounding conversation and making sure that each character's voice is distinct that's a big problem that a lot of authors have including myself overall i think that if you focus on these areas your stories will be even more engaging and enjoyable to read perfect okay i think this is good we're three for three i like this so let me just do a quick git commit so we can preserve everything we've got here get status get add all git commit am really in love with this prompt and results um running the full thing now okay get push and uh yeah okay so now let's do um python generate completions so we'll let that run in the background there's another

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I will provide you with critical feedback to improve your pros and style. I will also use the compliment sandwich method of feedback, which means I will open and close with a compliment, and provide the harsh part in the middle.

First, let me commend you for your excellent use of description. Your descriptions are very vivid and bring the setting and characters to life. However, I felt that the story lost a bit of momentum in the middle when Kate is exploring the factory. I would recommend focusing on one or two key images or scenes, rather than trying to describe the whole factory in detail. The ending of the story is very effective, and the image of the door slamming shut is particularly chilling.

There are a few areas that could be improved. For example, your dialogue could be more natural and less stiff. Additionally, the story could be proofread for grammar errors. Overall, this is a strong story with good potential.
