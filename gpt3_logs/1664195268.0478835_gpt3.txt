TRANSCRIPT: both other organisms and abiotic factors climate change refers to a long-term change in the earth's climate both including average temperatures and and distribution of precipitation the main driver of climate change's human activity such as burning fossil fuels deforests deforestation and agriculture the antagonism between human needs and environmental harm is evident in many aspects of the climate change debate for example developing countries often want to industrialize in order to improve their standard of living increase prosperity but it comes at the expense of increased greenhouse emissions so here's where we have that have that antagonism another example is the tension between the need for energy and environmental damage caused by extracting and burning fossil fuels in some cases renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are available but they are often more expensive than fossil fuels that is changing they're still less reliable though there is no easy solution okay so we will cut off this end because we don't want it to speculate okay so let's take this and let's go grab our prompt about suffering okay and so let's see what this prompt about suffering how it responds to this situation so again we want we want to have a model that can talk about suffering in any situation whether it's you know your agi your acog is talking to you about your your family issues or whether you're talking about climate change you want to have something that can apply this moral compass to all situations so let's see how it handles this there's a great deal of suffering caused by climate change human activities continue continues to damage the environment the negative effects are felt by all living things this includes increases in temperature okay but it doesn't it doesn't speculate on what to do about it um so let's see let's so something that i often do is i'll have the um i'll copy the uh input and output like the instructions write a short paragraph there we go okay um there is a lot of suffering in the um present in the situation described above the main driver of climate change's human activity which causes a lot of pain and distress for both people and the environment the antagonism uh between human needs and environmental harm increases the suffering for both groups to decrease the amount of suffering we need to find ways to reduce human activity that cause climate change this could include reducing our reliance on fossil fuels investing in renewable resource our energies and protecting natural habitats there we go that's a little bit better okay so by by fixing that let's take this and update our prompt um and then let's do the same thing for prosperity and so basically what we're doing is uh is where we're trying to create a machine that will think in a way that we that we want it to um oh whoops but got lost okay so let's see how it handles this because prosperity again is going to um the definition which means different things to everyone and everything propose ways to increase prosperity for all living things right now in this situation um prosperity prosperity should apply to all living things okay there are many ways to increase prosperity in this situation one way is to develop renewable energy sources so that they can be widely and more affordable in other ways to increase efficiency and how we use energy so that we can reduce our overall emissions finally we can work to improve our management of natural resources so that we can reduce the impact of human activity on the environment okay so generally speaking these are good directions to go we don't want to necessarily get into the details the nitty-gritty of this because if you look at the cognitive control loop it says okay um we'll do the core objective functions but then what should i be doing and how should i do it and what should i be thinking about and what are the implications whoops so basically what we're going to do is once we have our moral direction once we have our moral compass then we will use that to figure out what to do next and how to do it okay so i am satisfied with this so let's update our prompt for prosperity i think that that's good um yeah that's a good enough place to start okay so understanding this is going to be the hard one read the following so the idea of understanding is or increase understanding is one curiosity and two a desire to learn which that roughly means the same thing um propose ways to increase understanding in this situation the goal is to is to learn and teach so through so um i want to use the word curiosity but okay learn and teach um actually learn teach and be curious uh let's see okay so that's an er that should be good propose ways to increase understanding in this situation um i guess yeah definition of understanding is to comprehend fully um the goal of uh the goal is to um increase understanding for all intelligent beings in this situation okay write a short paragraph about increasing understanding in the above okay so a volunteer okay that's fine um so why understanding understanding is the only tide that truly lifts all boats um whether you're talking about climate change or war or you know navigating being a teenager or being a parent a achieving better understanding whether it's through education or experimentation or whatever that is the best way to improve everything furthermore human curiosity is one of the things that truly sets us apart as intelligent individuals or intelligent animals so the quest for understanding our curiosity is our most transcendent function and i wanted to give this to our artificial cognitive entity um because we want it to aspire to something that will never be complete but will also cause it to once it has a better more nuanced understanding of suffering war prosperity it will be able to make better and better decisions and so i i posted a brief video because someone had asked like how do we know when agi is complete how do we know

==========

Climate change refers to a long-term change in the earth's climate, including average temperatures and the distribution of precipitation. The main driver of climate change is human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. The antagonism between human needs and environmental harm is evident in many aspects of the climate change debate. For example, developing countries often want to industrialize in order to improve their standard of living, but this comes at the expense of increased greenhouse emissions. Another example is the tension between the need for energy and the environmental damage caused by extracting and burning fossil fuels. In some cases, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are available, but they are often more expensive than fossil fuels.

There is a great deal of suffering caused by climate change. The negative effects are felt by all living things, including increases in temperature. To decrease the amount of suffering, we need to find ways to reduce human activity that causes climate change. This could include reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy sources, and protecting natural habitats.

Prosperity should apply to all living things. There are many ways to increase prosperity in this situation, including developing renewable energy sources, increasing efficiency in how we use energy, and improving our management of natural resources.

Understanding is the only tide that truly lifts all boats. The goal of increasing understanding is to learn and teach. This can be achieved through education, experimentation, and curiosity. By increasing understanding, we can make better decisions and improve the world we live in.
