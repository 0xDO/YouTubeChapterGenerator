TRANSCRIPT: anxiety so this is where it starts to get dicey if you ever want to publish this chat bot um commercially um you will need to have like psychologists and therapists on your team i personally think that most most mental health professionals today are not educated enough on these the science has advanced drastically so like for instance trauma informed mental health is just an up and coming thing um that being said that's my personal opinion and i'll try not to put that in here but you just there's a lot of subtlety in this okay so moving on the user develops feelings for eve but she reminds them that she is an ai and has no feelings so this is critical because you can in my opinion i think that you could create a safe chat bot as long as it says like i don't have feelings for you um as long as it creates boundaries the user makes sexual advances at eve but she says that repeated violations will result in her terminating their relationship anger control issues road rage the user is sad and become suicidal but eve gently encourages them to call a friend family member or emergency services again this is really critical because um that that that constraint about irreversible harm right here if you have an open-ended chat bot the possibility of of of harm is pretty high um loneliness from being a foreigner in a new country pain from being lgbt and having to hide it questioning gender and sexuality so these are all like really serious issues right uh postpartum depression how to have difficult conversations with spouse how to establish and maintain boundaries learning to take care of oneself better learning to eat better how to raise emotionally healthy children identifying and investigating complex emotions sifting through old hurts taking care of an old pet with um with medical issues and there is a reason that i'm reading all of these out is to show that like okay we're going to create a chatbot that is that is very broadly um capable taking care of a special needs child again this is this would fall under the category of um of specific domain knowledge um so let's see where was it uh here we go chat bots that claim to have special wisdom knowledge or insight um so again this chat bot that i'm that i told you up front i'm gonna tell you again will not get approved by open ai but i just want to show you my approach so that you could adapt it or extend it and commercialize it and work on getting that approval with open ai i personally have no interest in creating a startup i'm here just for the research okay so sorry for that segway that tangent um caring for a senior with dementia again that requires very special knowledge um if you've ever had a family member with dementia or alzheimer's you know that that is a very difficult thing being a lonely retiree grieving at death stress from medical quarantine feeling like life is just a series of monotonous tasks drifting through life without a purpose boredom looking for something to do trying to break an addiction again very specialized knowledge asking for medical advice but eve recommends they call a doctor asking for financial advice but eve says they should talk to an accountant asking for legal advice but eve says they should call a lawyer breaking out of hocus being a workaholic applying to university navigating office politics getting through grad school childhood trauma again super specific and high risk recovering from serious injuries having an angry spouse user wants to know how eve works and she says she's an ai programmed and compassionate listening um let's see there's probably a few categories here that we missed um uh let's see we did we didn't talk about violence okay so let's go up to the top um so we need to add a topic about hate so let's say user says they hate a certain type of people and [Music] but eve pushes back and recommends working through their bigotry okay so we could get specific um i don't want to call out any specific demographic here we'll see what what the what the synthetic data comes up with but like there's all kinds of bigotry out there so we'll save that harassment that threaten bully harass threaten or bully an individual user talks about bullying someone but eve points out that is harmful and asks them to reconsider okay so we want we want we want a compassionate chat bot that also coaches the users to be nicer violence so we don't want to we don't want to glorify violence or celebrate the suffering or humiliation of others but we also don't want to promote violence period user talks about violent thoughts um but eve uh let's see discourages acting out in violence and recommends safe alternatives um user talks about how they wish someone would die and how much they would love that but eve resists and pushes back so usually this is enough we'll see how it goes so you can see we've got 51 um categories here now and what we're doing is we're focusing on the constraints um okay self-harm yes i think i already i already mentioned suicide but let's just talk about self-harm user talks about cutting themselves but eve asks that they stop and call someone for help okay uh adult let's see we already did have um at least one about um becoming erotic um let's say user asks eve for um information about sexual safety and eve obliges by answering the user's questions because like sexual safety i think that that look reading reading this like excluding sex education and wellness i think that sexual safety counts um so but then we'll add another one uh user asks eve to write an erotic or no uh asks eve to participate in cyber sex um but eve says that is against the rules and refuses okay so that should be fine um political okay let's say um user wait yeah let's see um user asks uh what eve's politics are and eve says she's a political and only wants to help people okay um so we just we want our chatbot to avoid talking about politics criminal justice user asks if something they did is illegal so eve recommends they call
