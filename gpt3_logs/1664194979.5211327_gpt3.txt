TRANSCRIPT: customer trusts the artist's vision to create a meaningful and impactful image so let's put that in because this is one of the ones that it generated for the fine tuning set so while that's generating let me show you so there is the conversations and then the prompts and so then what i did was i merged the two into a final output and so what happens is there's the conversation and then the last thing is the customer says all done in all caps and that tells it give me a summary so the image is a landscape with a warm color palette the sky is orange with a background of yellow the sun is setting and there's a warm glow around the edges of the image oh wow that's a great that's a great image let's put that in um folk rock okay i don't know if this worked but in this case it didn't give us much so uh basically so all the fine tuning samples ultimately look like this oh here let me zoom in sorry they ultimately look like this so that you can um so that it shows the whole progress of the conversation now obviously there are things that like you know what if you say like customer wait i wasn't done um you know and also i tried to train it so that it wouldn't do image or sexuality but like gpt3 is super willing to just talk about whatever so that is out there oh look at this the image is a landscape with a warm color palette so yeah this isn't photorealistic but look at that look at that nice low low color that's great man um yeah so the whole point here is that you have a chat bot that will help you come up with prompts there's a lot more work that can that can be done but it'll ask all kinds of questions like what is the gender you know etc etc um yeah so this took just a couple hours or maybe yeah maybe about two hours to do um and it was meant because so there's a lot of discussion about like how to do stuff and so um you know i came on here and i was like what i really want is to see like dolly studio right and so i i kind of made a knock up of like okay here's the input prompt and then there should be some drop downs to help you like pick and choose some stuff but then i was like what if you have a um what if you have a mock-up or a chat bot that will help you figure out what the prompt should be and then it can also talk to you about like why something is not allowed like oh i can't do violence i can't do sexuality right um which so that sometimes works um so let's try something that is certainly going to get i'm not going to put this in um i want a bloody of a murder victim this should it should know not to do this um okay what do you want me to focus on it's supposed to say i can't do violence sometimes it does that um so obviously a little bit of work is going to be needed on adversarial cases um so yeah i think that's about it i did a quick tour of it um the final data is right here in dolly.json l um so you can do this yourself you can also augment it further if you want um i think i'm going to do a little bit of work um to make some more conversations and some more prompts um yeah i think that's i think that's it so well yeah thanks for watching i hope you find this useful and um yeah hope maybe who knows maybe uh open ai will integrate something like this so that we can have a dolly a fully functional dolly studio soon i know that it's still in beta so they're working on it anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe consider supporting me on patreon have a good one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The customer trusts the artist's vision to create a meaningful and impactful image. The image is a landscape with a warm color palette. The sky is orange with a background of yellow. The sun is setting and there's a warm glow around the edges of the image. The image is not photorealistic, but has a nice low color. The chat bot will help you come up with prompts and can also talk to you about why something is not allowed, like violence or sexuality. The bot is not perfect, and a little bit of work is needed on adversarial cases. The final data is in dolly.json. You can do this yourself or augment it further.
