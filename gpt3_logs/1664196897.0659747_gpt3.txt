The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: okay so let's just let this run let's turn the token count up to a thousand and then it starts writing okay I don't want you to actually start writing it um so this isn't so good I want to actually give me like yeah not not just a table of contents but like describe each section so this is this is one thing that's really infuriating about um about the instructor series is that if you can tell if it was trained to do something like what you're asking it to do because it'll do it really well but if it wasn't it will just give you a table of contents and then start writing a thing um yeah actually I wonder if I confused it all right because like what is Shinto there we go how to inter incorporate tour Gates into your Japan trip that's not so bad okay so by I confused it when I said like add a paragraph because then it's like okay let's let's write out all these things and then yeah all right let's run this a couple times just to make sure that it's going to give me consistent Behavior the significance of tour Gates the different types of tour Gates the most famous story gates in Japan okay I think we're off to a good start so let's copy this as our first prompt um okay so we'll do request and then we'll do that so this we've got prompt um so this is going to be sections so let's see brainstorm the structure um take a list of bunch of sections iterate on that list to improve it is this a good list was I a good list you were the best list all right so what I mean by this is um lots of folks have started asking about like doing um like having gpt3 check itself to improve uh its own performance and I find that it can work really well not always um so let's just give let's take a stab at this let's copy this whole prompt out just for posterity's sake okay um I brainstormed the following list of blogs SEC of sections of a Blog um based on the customer's request um I need to uh uh um brainstorm to see if there's any there are any improvements they can make to this past uh uh I guess outline yeah that's the word I know words okay so then we'll do we'll copy the customer request and then we'll do outline and let's come back over here copy that all right and so then we'll do uh brainstorm let's see no brainstorm some possible improvements all right let's see what it does dad doesn't get it well maybe it added a list it added an item how to visit Tory Gates oh okay [Music] let's run that again see if it gives us what is Shinto okay tips for seeing tour Gates so it did add a section [Music] all right hmm I wonder what happens if we do this again okay what happens if we just regurgitate this Shinto festivals associated with tour Gates look at that okay so if we run this so this I'm at the point in my career with gpt3 where like if my intuition generates a prompt that behaves correctly the first time I don't trust it because I'm like wait a second hmm is this an accident so then we'll say outline um but basically prompt um improve outline and we'll change the sections to outline because for whatever reason my brain did not helpfully supply the word outline because that's where you start when you're writing anything start an outline um uh yeah okay so then we'll take I keep leaning over because my camera my microphone's a little bit in the way so if the audio is a little bit worse I apologize but I want to not be leaning over the whole video okay let's just keep recycling this to see um see if it keeps improving frequently asked questions I wonder if it's just gonna keep adding sections because this is actually doing a good job of like what can we do to add to this so probably if if it keeps going indefinitely okay so now what we have done is is it has converged so what we can do is we'll just keep rerunning this um until until we get convergence which means that the input is the same as the output um okay so yep so that's good and what am I doing all right so improve outline and let's see keep it an editor no because I named it wrong so we've got the outline and then we've got improve outline and that's good okay yes I wonder will it break if I if I give it a number one that might prompt it to ensure that it will oh additional resources okay so one thing that you can do is you can kind of give it a clue as to what you want want it to look like and so that's what you do here where I have this this is just it's a clue it says give me a numbered list right I don't have to tell it to give me a numbered list I just give it a little tiny breadcrumb to say give me a numbered list um so I might do the same here just so that way because sometimes you might end up with something where it's like hey I'm going to come up with a completely new idea um but if you tell it what you want implicitly or explicitly so this is an implicit request of the machine so this might this might break it we'll have to after we run it we might um we might have to come back to this um okay let's go here okay request all right and then I think it's time to start coding actually um because what I like to do is before I get too far um actually no well hmm let me take a look at uh at the readme how far do we want to go okay so we got the iteration so we're already halfway done brainstorm some facts or points to include for each section okay so let's try this then let's try our hand at yada yada yada I wish I hadn't closed those other ones okay so given ah let's see I have the following uh blog request to write um I am focusing on um writing one second at a time um or uh let's see I need to brainstorm uh no I need to jot down some notes about each section before I proceed now each section this section um this section before I proceed okay um section so then we'll just say what is Shinto and then we'll say um let's see here are my research notes on this section I need to write everything I know about this and let's see what it does okay here are my let's say let's let's see what happens we say detailed research notes there we go much better
