TRANSCRIPT: to maximize that thing and so it it was very very much just focused on gathering data and making models with that data it was also so the instruct series were less creative and less expansive so they converged rather than diverged the foundation models were much more expansive they were very divergent just kind of going in all directions um however they were also intrinsically unstable the only agent model that was stable and and what i mean by stable is that it stayed kind of focused on its core purpose was my core objective functions unsurprisingly that's what i developed them for but the future freedom of action and the um and the uh the no objective functions um that tended to create a lot more hallucinations and confabulations and they also became very self self-obsessed um like dangerously so so in in short instruct models are intrinsically more stable though they lack expansiveness and creativity and tend to be repetitive while they are more stable their tendency to get stuck in a rut might be detrimental to the application of autonomous machines their lack of flexibility could be harmful agent models had minimal impact on overall creativity all three converged after just a few cycles conversely while foundation models are intrinsically unstable in recursive loops they are far more expansive creative and philosophical regardless of which agent model is used there was no convergence this indicates that despite their instability foundation models might be better suited for long-term open-ended tasks so instruct models converge foundation models diverge that's the primary difference and you know agent models the right agent model used with a divergent one still kind of kept kind of gave it guard rails so then finally discussion this set of experiments used a simple loop whereby only two functions summary and one prompt were used repetitively despite the simplicity of this experiment it successfully demonstrated stability versus instability depending on the agent model or llm future experiments should include more complex environments such as prompt chaining multiple agents and simulated worlds so by adding even more entropy and even more complexity or chaos we'll be able to to stress test the alignment of these models these agent models as well as the instruct series models okay so thanks for watching i'm actually less salty now that i've run this experiment so i'll have to think on that

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this experiment, the focus was on gathering data and creating models from that data. The goal was to find out which type of model – instruct, agent, or foundation – is more stable.

After running the experiment, it was found that instruct models are more stable than foundation models. However, agent models were found to be the most stable of the three. This indicates that agent models are better suited for long-term tasks.

Despite their stability, instruct models have a tendency to get stuck in a rut. This could be detrimental to the application of autonomous machines. On the other hand, foundation models are more expansive and creative, but they are also less stable.

In future experiments, more complex environments should be used to stress test the alignment of the different models.
