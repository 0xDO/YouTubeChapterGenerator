TRANSCRIPT: q continuum becomes a thing boredom that lasts boredom the last frontier okay so cue continuum is from star trek so the the the q are a race of like the the final evolution of intelligent life basically where they come to understand the universe so well that with the flip of of or the snap of their fingers they can change anything that they want they can go forward backward in time they can modify timelines they can create things they can erase memories whatever they want to do so basically they're they're basically like loki or at least the the one that recurs throughout um the show is basically like loki which is he's kind of a trickster god but he always has a point he always has a moral lesson so the idea the the problem here that old zany is proposing is let's imagine that we create agi it stabilizes humanity and we have life expectancies of of billions of years and this is a thought that has crossed my mind because if we solve aging we solve all medical problems we stabilize the planet you know the sun's going to burn out eventually okay what do we do by then right well if we're that if we're that smart that powerful and we live that long then like we just hop on a cruise ship and go to the next star right because even if it takes four million years to get to the next star we have a life span of billions of years so it's just gonna be a long cruise right but we need novelty right part of part of what makes us human is a need for novelty and we actually also need stress there's an optimal level of stress that we need in order to be happy healthy otherwise our brain starts to deteriorate it literally starts to deteriorate which is one of the reasons that um that the pandemic was so hard because you had a combination of boredom and stress and so like a lot of people myself included have had to recover some gray matter from the pandemic um so yeah what do we do i don't know um there was one work of fiction i think it was it was based on um the the myth of atlantis actually so the myth of atlantis was that there was these like um uh basically fountains of youth but what they said or was rubies or something um what what they said in the story and this might have been a translation of the original but i don't think it was but what they said in the story was that after several hundred years people would get bored of living and just let themselves die so that's actually a possibility is one thing so you think about like bees um my fiance used to be a beekeeper so she has all kinds of stories about bees so what bees do is the older that they get the more dangerous job they take on so the last job a bee takes on in its lifestyle life cycle is foraging it goes further and further from the nest bringing back pollen because there's a good chance it's not going to come back and you don't want the young healthy bees to do that you want the veterans to go out because their wings are shredded they're tired they might get eaten they might get lost they might get caught in a storm but you don't want all your youthful workers to do that you want the young strong ones to defend the hive um that's i think defending the hive is the second thing that they do the first thing that they do because also you want to you care about parasite load so the first thing that they do is they tend to the hive itself they help um i think they care for young and help build the hive because they don't have mites or anything yet and then um and then in the middle of their life they defend the hive because they're still strong um but they're you know they're they've been replaced by a new crop and then the last thing that they do is they go foraging so one thing that i think that that might happen is that as humans age and we get bored we'll probably take on riskier and riskier jobs such as exploring new galaxies right because let's say you go through a wormhole or something there's a good chance that you only come out as atoms on the other side right and it's like well you know i've been around for 10 million years i you know i can take a risk or two the other thing though there's another work of fiction and i can't remember what it was called but it basically said that it's it posited that one thing that humans will do once we live a long time is it will actually become really lazy and complacent and that will will become very risk-averse they will be like no like because the longer you live the more entitled to life that you feel so i don't know which way it's going to go um let's see some rando says on the fundamental nature of reality what do you think about the plank length is reality basically digital uh several orders of magnitude below modern quantum physics and we just have no way of probing anything approaching that scale so that that idea of like the voxel is actually was it in this book or i think it was actually in simulation hypothesis so basically some folks think that plank length and plank time so for anyone who doesn't know plank length and plank time are the smallest what we think of right now as the smallest length of measurable distance and the smallest length of measurable time but everything below that is like uh um stepped or gated or whatever um so the short answer is yes some people think that that plank length and plank's time plank time plank length plank time there we go i said i said it right um those are basically like the fundamental voxels or time steps of the universal simulation i don't know if i agree with that interpretation but it's a possibility again like the smarter you are the more you know the more possibilities you see and the fewer answers you have um that's that's how you know you're doing science right if you end up with more questions and answers um let's see um let's see oh yeah so adrian replied about the ufos saying it's probably just the government agencies to justify their funding it's entirely possible um they
