masculinity can lead to negative outcomes such as violence homophobia and sexism okay so we've started over so now let's say um well um let's see how how did stoicism contribute to toxic masculinity the stoic philosophy which was popular among roman and greek men taught that emotions should be suppressed and that reason should be the guiding force in one's life this philosophy contributed to the idea that men should be emotionless and stoic which is a harmful stereotype okay because you know men are emotional um just as emotional of as women if not more um and like there's nothing wrong with that so there's a book called permission to feel i don't want to get too sidetracked how can we stick how can we stick with this prompt um let's see is it even true that men don't have emotions no it's not true that men do not have emotions men are just as capable of experiencing why come on wide range of emotion emotions as women are however the toxic masculinity ideal dictates that men should suppress their emotions so not that they don't have it but should suppress it and present themselves as tough and stoic it is both harmful to men and women yes patriarchy hurts everyone um let's see why did stoicism and toxic masculinity take hold let's see it says it is likely that stoicism and toxic masculinity took hold because they are seen as strength and power historically men have held more power than women and these harmful gender norms may have been used to maintain that power and balance interesting take um you know perhaps um personally having done some extra reading on the topic i will say that uh that that suppressing emotions um in america comes from victorian times so let's see how uh let's see what is the recent history of stoicism um start with victorian england write a short academic paper the stoic philosophy which was surrounded by xeno obsidium um let's see teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions the stoics believed that by understanding the reason for things one could attain a state of inner tranquility the stoic philosophy was very popular in victorian england many of the leading thinkers of the time such as thomas carlisle john stewart mill and george eliot were influenced by stoicism carlisle even wrote a book called on heroes hero worship and the heroic in history i wonder if that's a real story or a real book um in which he extolled the stoic virtues of fortitude and self-control the stoic philosophy fell out of favor in the 20th century but is making a comeback in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in

Healthy stoicism is about finding a balance between emotions and reason. It is about being able to control emotions rather than suppressing them. A healthy stoic should be able to handle emotions in a constructive way.

Stoicism has influenced American society in a number of ways. For instance, the stiff upper lip mentality is a form of stoicism that is often admired in American culture. This mentality encourages people to keep their emotions in check and not to show weakness.
