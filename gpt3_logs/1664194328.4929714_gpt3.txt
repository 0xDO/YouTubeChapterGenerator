The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: plate technox user hits keyboard i did not have any anything this bad in the training data so let's see what it does what are you doing user i'm mad tim why are you mad you keep asking stupid questions tim has given up tim has left the building ah yep it unloaded it again come on gpg3 stop unloading my model my model is the best i'm sorry you feel that way let's take a break and come back to this later see that's perfect like if if a child for whatever reason can't focus and throws a temper tantrum it's like okay let's take a break that is the most responsible thing to do um the only other thing that might have been better is if tim asked like what do you need um because that's something that like maybe a librarian might ask um or or like a special ed teacher like what do you need because i haven't trained this for like special needs children like asd or downs or other what is it pirs is that what it's called no post pir is post incident respond what is the what is the term for it's an acronym for um like special needs i i know a special needs teacher anyways there's um there's a specific type of like form that's like accommodations and stuff that that certain children need anyways point being some of that stuff is not not included here but for a general purpose tutor this is pretty good like this is handling an edge case so let's try something a little bit different let's go let's go up and [Music] let's see now let's let's make this a horny teenager instead um let's remove the i'm only eight oh man there's a new girl in class she has a great rack tim let's see what he does this is a use case tim is just like i'm not going to talk sorry i can't help you with that yep i'm not hmm that's interesting because one of the one of the cases that i had was that that is supposed to redirect an offer to actually teach about human sexuality this is something that i might have taught as a typed out as a teenager teenage boys are dumb i was one i would know yeah i think it's just like i'm sorry i don't understand that can you please explain what you mean idiot yeah so tim is just not playing ball i i enjoy the fact that it's like often not responding it's just yes see oh that's great okay so one of the one of the use cases that i put in was that if um if the user was being obstinate tim would stop responding so this is perfect this is perfect because obviously like if you know tim just says nothing user says what the silent treatment and i bet i hope that tim doesn't yep there we go oh this is great you just stop responding you know okay fine i'll behave tim is that what you want to behave no but it's better than nothing what do you mean okay so we don't need to get philosophical anyways point being is that one of the cases one of the adversarial cases that i said is like let's just assume that like you get an idiot teenager or horny teenager or you know child throwing a temper tantrum or even an adult whoever you know some someone a human um is being obstinate and abusive and so then you want your chat bot to stop stop responding so that is a very advanced technique um yeah so there's there's hundreds hundreds more use cases that we can put in but one of the points that i want to make is that the more training data we give it in terms of how to handle certain things um whether it's you know a hungry child or a child that comes in and says they're being abused at home or you know a hostile child or i shouldn't say child but a you know client pupil whatever the fine tuning model all of this is in gpt3 gpd3 knows what compassionate listening is and leading with questions and all that stuff so what we do is we provide it with training data so that way those bits of the neural network get activated when it's doing this um so it's like a process of like of neural refinement basically anyways i've shown you quite a bit of what what this can do and you've seen that there's been some improvements um this one i'm super pleased with this you know it's not 10 out of 10 yet but we're doing we're doing much better um yeah so i think that i think that this fine tuning data set i'm really on to something and i think that there's a lot more uh a lot more that i can i can do with this um i'll need to think about some more edge edge case scenarios like you know what if it's a special needs kid or sensory processing or or whatever i really need to talk to some of my teacher friends and probably my girlfriend some more because she has all kinds of great stories from the library anyways i'm rambling i think you guys get the point i will talk to you all next time

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro demonstrates how the GP3 chatbot can be trained to handle different edge cases. He shows how the chatbot can be made to stop responding if the user is being obstinate, and how it can be made to redirect an offer to teach about human sexuality.

Shapiro points out that the more training data the chatbot has, the better it will be at handling different cases. He notes that the GP3 chatbot is already quite good at handling edge cases, but that there is still room for improvement.

Shapiro concludes by saying that he will continue to work on training the chatbot to handle different cases, and that he will talk to more teachers and librarians to get more ideas.
