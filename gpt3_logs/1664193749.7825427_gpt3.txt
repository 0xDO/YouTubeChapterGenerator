TRANSCRIPT: could be asked internally so that's how i use it in natural language cognitive architecture is it asks internal questions because the answers to those internal questions might also be helpful in order to help the end user so yeah there you have it that's one example and while we've got it loaded let me go ahead and give another one let's see how do i stay positive during the depressing stages of a job hunt i think this uh this these subred or these reddit posts uh almost certainly came from um from an academic or or job job hunting subreddit alright so let's see what it says here one thing you'll also notice is well i think it took two i let it unload so it'll take a minute oh there we go once it actually does load it's very fast because these are based on curie and curie is 10 times smaller than da vinci and and is therefore very very fast okay so how do i stay positive six months ago i left a job with a major publisher due to unhealthy work environment i'm a very qualified editor etc etc okay so what is the writer's current job title and company they might be unemployed what are the writers interest in hobbies is the current job a good fit for the writers interests and hobbies do you think the current job will provide good income in this case let's see did they yeah six months ago he left i knew the position i accepted was only temporary and this oh okay he is still in a transitional position all right i was i was afraid that it had misunderstood anyways from reading this it seems he's he is he is presently working okay um although it's it's a little ambiguous so maybe maybe the maybe the model didn't pick up on that um but yeah these are these are perfectly valid questions to ask right uh maybe they're not the most salient questions but this post is also a little bit all over the place right but by asking follow-up questions you can kind of zero in on what someone actually needs but again also you could put anything in this you could put a newspaper article you can put a wikipedia article in and you'll get all kinds of um all kinds of uh salient questions to ask which you could use them for anything you can use them for chat bots you can use them for test questions and again this is nauka question generator it's public it's available to all under the mit license right here so everyone can use it and there you have it there's a perfectly good demonstration of how to how to how to use it the training file is right here it's the questions.jsonl you can create your own you can take this it is ready to go with openai's gpt3 yep and i think that's about it thanks for watching
