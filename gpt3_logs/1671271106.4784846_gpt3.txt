how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:13.740,0:04:20.460
to only go to websites that respect human artists
you know whereas and it's kind of dividing right
0:04:20.460,0:04:25.740
because I think Deviant Art they're like let's
go all in like there's just a whole new category
0:04:25.740,0:04:31.380
of AI art whereas art station is like bands it
outright so we're going in different directions
0:04:31.380,0:04:37.320
and that's generally what happens historically
speaking you generally get like it's not like
0:04:37.320,0:04:44.220
either or things split right and another example
is with the invention of the automobile right the
0:04:44.220,0:04:48.480
invention the automobile put all the stable
hands out of business right all the people
0:04:48.480,0:04:54.600
who cared intended for horses even the number of
horses in the world went down after the invention
0:04:54.600,0:05:00.240
of automobiles right so like not only did we
put horses out of the out of a job we had less
0:05:00.240,0:05:06.300
demand for that species as a whole and now there
are fewer horses are they extinct no we still
0:05:06.300,0:05:12.780
keep horses um we go to you know the conduct the
Kentucky Derby we watch them race some people and
0:05:12.780,0:05:18.060
horses some people ride horses for fun you know
there's they're still Trail horses so whenever
0:05:18.060,0:05:24.000
technology advances and dislocates something that
we're used to it doesn't I don't want to say never
0:05:24.000,0:05:30.840
it usually doesn't go away completely there are
some things that are fully eradicated but there's
0:05:30.840,0:05:36.420
nothing that's like AI art just makes art much
more accessible and I think about people like
0:05:36.420,0:05:43.440
myself that I just do not have the right skill
set and so like I'm not going to bring it up but
0:05:43.440,0:05:48.120
I started making like a Manga version of my novel
which is something that would have been completely
0:05:48.120,0:05:55.500
out of reach for me as an individual so that I can
tell this story in a visual way for myself now is
0:05:55.500,0:06:02.640
that fair to the artists like you know I I paid an
artist a graphic artist like what was it like 700
0:06:03.960,0:06:10.920
um in order to make just just a cover art for
my novel right and it's it's it's weird because
0:06:10.920,0:06:16.200
it's like okay I could spend like 15 cents or
you know a couple dollars using out painting to
0:06:16.200,0:06:20.460
get something pretty close and then I could
probably you know use uh some more AI tools
0:06:20.460,0:06:25.860
to clean it up and make it you know a little a
little nicer so it's like okay it cost me like
0:06:25.860,0:06:32.220
two dollars or seven hundred dollars right from an
economic perspective it makes sense because AI art
0:06:33.000,0:06:38.820
increases the amount of production of Art and
you know we humans have a nearly unlimited
0:06:38.820,0:06:45.300
appetite for art um anyways I'm kind of in
danger of repeating myself but you know I
0:06:45.300,0:06:52.080
just I just wanted to to share like I took
down my my code and and uh my videos around
0:06:53.100,0:06:58.980
um generating novels generating fiction and
they're gonna stay down for that reason that being
0:06:58.980,0:07:04.440
said I am still working on lots of tools but the
tools that I'm working on are specific to helping
0:07:04.440,0:07:10.140
human writers right like there's editors that I
like the editor that I hired I spent Seventeen
0:07:10.140,0:07:16.800
hundred dollars getting my novel edited by a human
and this is while I have the capacity to make AI
0:07:16.800,0:07:23.160
tools to edit it for me right so I still chose
to go with a human um because there are there
0:07:23.160,0:07:30.660
are still those ineffable qualities of of you know
going with a human now is is is going with a human
0:07:30.660,0:07:34.740
editor going to be like you know owning your own
horse in the future where it's just infinitely
0:07:34.740,0:07:40.140
more expensive to to do something you know the
hard way the old-fashioned way possibly but maybe
0:07:40.140,0:07:44.100
not I don't know like I want to try and make
tools for the editors too because I really like
0:07:44.100,0:07:50.580
my editor right she's a brilliant woman and knows
this art so thoroughly and is clearly passionate
0:07:50.580,0:07:55.260
for it and there's probably still there's always
going to be things that humans do differently and
0:07:55.260,0:08:01.620
better than machines and vice versa even all the
top players in every industry will say there are
0:08:01.620,0:08:06.000
things that computers and machines in general are
better at than humans and there are things that
0:08:06.000,0:08:11.280
humans are better at and often kind of the way
that it usually shakes out is it's like okay let's
