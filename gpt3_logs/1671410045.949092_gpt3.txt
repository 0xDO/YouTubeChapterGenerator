how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:03.900,0:00:08.460
good morning everybody David Shapiro
here we are back for part two of the
0:00:08.460,0:00:15.780
um Knowledge Graph Supreme Court decision thing
so we're using chat GPT and gpt3 to help us along
0:00:16.680,0:00:25.980
and as a quick recap where we left off was um
I didn't get that far um but I downloaded about
0:00:25.980,0:00:31.620
22 Supreme Court opinions this was about
Anti-Trust law so a very specific domain
0:00:32.700,0:00:40.260
um and then I got them converted to text so that
is um I did that with another uh repo it's fine
0:00:40.260,0:00:47.100
but then what we did was the the big thing that we
achieved was that we figured out that we can get
0:00:47.100,0:00:54.960
gpt3 to just go ahead and write my um write the
uh Whatchamacallit for us the the knowledge graph
0:00:54.960,0:01:03.600
Json and so what I'm doing is the nodes that I
asked for was each node should be a case citation
0:01:03.600,0:01:08.520
precedent or prior opinion each node should
have several properties such as date case number
0:01:08.520,0:01:14.700
involved parties reasoning for including in this
opinion and other relevant information so that
0:01:15.360,0:01:19.260
um worked really well because you see like it's
got a case number it tells me when it happened
0:01:19.260,0:01:26.760
and then the reasoning so like involve parties
like great this is Phenom this is phenomenal
0:01:26.760,0:01:32.400
information so what we're doing is we're going
to create a cross-linked web as to like why
0:01:32.400,0:01:40.080
all these things are interlinked so that way
theoretically if a uh the the this hypothetical
0:01:40.080,0:01:46.560
use case if an attorney is researching antitrust
laws so that one they can you know go to a court
0:01:46.560,0:01:51.600
court of appeals or even present to the Supreme
Court they will have a masterful understanding
0:01:51.600,0:01:59.100
of established law and the reason that this is
important is because common law is um how law
0:01:59.100,0:02:05.040
Works in America it's by prior precedent is the
so you've got the the laws that are laid down by
0:02:05.040,0:02:10.920
the legislative branch and then interpreted by the
judicial branch and so the judicial branch keeps
0:02:10.920,0:02:15.660
track of their own interpretation right because
there's the legislative branches it it has to do
0:02:15.660,0:02:21.900
with separation of powers anyways so that's how
we got Where We Are um it worked really well and
0:02:21.900,0:02:26.760
um there's all kinds of what-ifs and gotchas that
I'm not going to worry about because this worked
0:02:26.760,0:02:32.820
really well and we can iterate over the over the
long term so but this I had to plug in manually
0:02:33.480,0:02:38.940
and it's about four pages so like if we do
if we search for how many new pages there are
0:02:39.780,0:02:44.580
one two three yeah one two three
so that this has four pages total
0:02:45.840,0:02:51.840
um which the that that was good so the
next problem is we got to take these and
0:02:51.840,0:02:57.300
regardless of how long they are we have to
break them down into chunks of four pages
0:02:57.300,0:03:04.860
maximum so rather than do this manually I was
like why don't I just ask chat GPT so here we go
0:03:06.480,0:03:21.300
um I have a folder named um uh let's see
um opinions uh text um this folder contains
0:03:22.380,0:03:38.880
um uh text files of scotus decisions um that
were converted from PDFs the pages are demarcated
0:03:39.480,0:03:50.160
by um by the words new page I need a python
function so I'm basically talking to this
0:03:50.160,0:03:56.880
thing like I'd be talking to a developer
I need the python function where I pass um
0:03:58.980,0:04:05.100
pass uh actually no I actually let's
just ask it to do the whole thing I
0:04:05.100,0:04:17.160
need a python function that um reads every
uh uh file in opinions underscore text um
0:04:19.980,0:04:29.640
and then breaks each file
into chunks of four pages um
0:04:30.840,0:04:45.120
the purpose of this is to um limit the size of
each subsequent file please then save the chunks
0:04:46.500,0:05:02.340
into um into a folder named chunks text
um and append um a serial number to
0:05:02.880,0:05:15.720
the original file name for instance um you know
star underscore one star underscore two and so on
0:05:17.700,0:05:18.720
all right let's see what it does
0:05:23.880,0:05:27.480
why would this violate the content policy
