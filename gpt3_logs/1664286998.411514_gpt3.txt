0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:31:25.440,0:31:31.980
directly my embeddings directory um oh and another
thing that I forgot was you need to have the
0:31:31.980,0:31:36.480
um you need to have the article ID in there if
you want to be able to find the full article
0:31:36.480,0:31:43.320
later so all right so there we go that looks a
little bit better so we have yeah look at that
0:31:43.320,0:31:50.700
so doing it in chunks rather than um rather than
doing it one at a time we're down to 3.3 hours
0:31:50.700,0:31:56.520
so it looks like it'll take about three hours
to do it in in chunks this big um do I want to
0:31:57.120,0:32:04.380
hey I'm going to be bold let's see let's see
and okay so here it's already processed 4 600.
0:32:05.340,0:32:12.120
are these articles by doing it in batches of a
hundred rather than one at a time so yeah this
0:32:12.120,0:32:16.920
is this is how you do it and there's the ID so you
got the article ID so you can go get it from the
0:32:16.920,0:32:22.560
original the original location but let's try let's
just be a little bit Bolder just just a little bit
0:32:23.880,0:32:29.340
delete these because if we can do them once we
can do them again so let's do a chunk size of
0:32:30.540,0:32:36.420
300. and if this works you know
so we're at down to 2.8 hours
0:32:37.620,0:32:44.220
um remaining thank you CLS all
right so if we do chunks of 300
0:32:45.240,0:32:49.020
I don't think it'll be three times faster and
it also might run out of memory but we'll see
0:32:50.340,0:32:56.040
um so the batch size has to do with how much
memory your GPU has and so you know you go
0:32:56.040,0:33:02.400
to Performance click on the GPU tab it'll
pre-load all the memory as it's spooling
0:33:02.400,0:33:06.960
up the model but then there's a certain amount
of I'm not sure how the inner workings are but
0:33:06.960,0:33:12.360
so you see it shoots up to use like seven and a
half gigabytes all right let's see what happens
0:33:13.620,0:33:20.820
if we see if we see it blow up with that you know
oom so now we're down to 7 000 chunks total rather
0:33:20.820,0:33:26.520
than 2.1 million individually okay so we're
doing larger chunks the time is coming down
0:33:26.520,0:33:31.500
and so what I'm doing in the background is I'm
averaging out like how long is it taking overall
