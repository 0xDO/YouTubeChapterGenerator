change this because we don't want we want to actually split the lines yeah okay so we'll need to change a couple things let's see how should i approach this i think i'm just going to need to take this out because we want to maintain the lines and um we will say i don't want to waste too many tokens um actually let's simplify this because i don't need multiple outputs i need just one generate a list um generate a list of well no because having a list output allows it to be more creative because there will be some slight variances oh also oh i wonder if i could fix this just by turning up the temperature let's go back before we get too carried away let's turn up the temperature a little one dot zero because this can go up to this can go up to two okay before before we get too carried away with over solutioning it let's try simple things so over here we've got seven romances looking at the console output most of them involve jenna most of them involve the weekend at a beach house so all right let's see if we can restart this and we get a better um better set of outputs um let's see let's go back here python generate premises all right so all i did was i changed the temperature from 0.7 to 1.0 um so let's see if we get that repetitiveness again jenna is looking forward to her evening run okay that's a little bit better jenna and ryan hit it off tamara is a successful businesswoman who seems to have it all she's beautiful and smart great starting to get some variety oh but you see how we're getting some some more vertical white space that i don't like hannah sets cross country road trip good linda's high powered executive yeah okay this is getting better so the simple thing is the better thing all i had to do is turn up the temperature let's add the canceling the white space add that back in that's fine for now jenny is a young woman who is struggling to find her place in the world good rachel is a successful young one notice how all the romances start with with a woman um falls in love with luke who learns to trust again sherry had always been a hopeless romantic so here's what i'll do i'll wait for this to get to about um like 20 or so or 25 rather and then i'll change the prompt actually no i don't need to stop it all i need to do is change the prompt um so we'll go to this so this is this is one advantage actually no that won't work because i only load the prompt once um yeah so for every iteration if i move this up into the into the loop then i could just change the prompt mid flight so actually let's do that um so let's do that put that here so now while it's iterating i can change the prompt mid-flight without having to cancel it um that'll be nice long day of work to her loving fiance miles um jenna and the stranger when olivia's mom dies she's left to fend for herself um so this is all this is all very like anglo-centric these are all like typical pretty much typically american names these aren't even like european names um so let me go ahead and pause this now and let's add a little bit of variety but first we're going to want to change where it starts okay so we're at 16 so let's go here and we'll start um we'll go we'll start at 17 and we'll go up to uh let's see let's we'll just go up to 30. and then we'll change this to uh let's close that one so i stopped clicking on it um for brainstorm a detailed

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

To have a first thing something that kind of stands before generating a premise, okay? So generate a list of random characters, locations, and genres, then we'll just do a dash there- giraffe, lighthouse, comedy, okay? Well, that's interesting. Um, uh, let's say long list and see what that does, because a giraffe, lighthouse comedy, that's not helpful. Um, oh random characters. Let's see. So we need to tell it for a story. Um, this is for brainstorming a story. Generate a long list of random characters, locations, and genres. There we go. Oh, good, good, good, good.

Okay, so here's what happens. It gives us some random stuff. Um, let's run this a couple times to see if it gives us similar things, because like a group of friends who get stranded on a desert island camping trip in the woods. Let's see if it's repetitive again. A family who owns a farm group of students, okay, yeah, this is this is okay. This is a little bit more random. Um, run it a few more times. Skilled archer town that is terrorized by a band of robbers, dark forest. Oh, this is great. A final battle between good and evil. Wonderful. Um, okay, so here's what we're going to do. We are going to create another prompt that stands before the first one, because we saw that it was being way too repetitive. Okay, um, let's call this prompt brainstorming brainstorm.

Okay, so first we're going to do that. And then ooh, ooh, I'm gonna need to change this, because we don't want we want to actually split the lines, yeah. Okay, so we'll need to change a couple things. Let's see how should I approach this? I think I'm just going to need to take this out, because we want to maintain the lines. And we will say, I don't want to waste too many tokens. Um, actually, let's simplify this, because I don't need multiple outputs. I need just one. Generate a list. Um, generate a list of well, no, because having a list output allows it to be more creative, because there will be some slight variances. Oh, also, oh, I wonder if I could fix this just by turning up the temperature. Let's go back before we get too carried away. Let's turn up the temperature a little to 1.0, because this can go up to this can go up to two. Okay, before before we get too carried away with over solutioning it, let's try simple things. So over here we've got seven romances, looking at the console output. Most of them involve Jenna. Most of them involve the weekend at a beach house. So all right, let's see if we can restart this and we get a better um, better set of outputs. Um, let's see. Let's go back here. Python generate premises. All right. So all I did was I changed the temperature from 0.7 to 1.0. Um, so let's see if we get that repetitiveness again. Jenna is looking forward to her evening run. Okay, that's a little bit better. Jenna and ryan hit it off. Tamara is a successful businesswoman who seems to have it all. She's beautiful and smart. Great. Starting to get some variety. Oh, but you see how we're getting some some more vertical white space that I don't like. Hannah sets cross country road trip. Good. Linda's high powered executive. Yeah, okay, this is getting better. So the simple thing is the better thing. All I had to do is turn up the temperature. Let's add the canceling the white space. Add that back in. That's fine for now. Jenny is a young woman who is struggling to find her place in the world. Good. Rachel is a successful young one. Notice how all the romances start with with a woman. Um falls in love with luke who learns to trust again. Sherry had always been a hopeless romantic. So here's what I'll do. I'll wait for this to get to about um, like 20 or so or 25 rather, and then I'll change the prompt. Actually, no, I don't need to stop it. All I need to do is change the prompt. Um, so we'll go to this. So this is this is one advantage. Actually, no, that won't work, because I only load the prompt once. Um, yeah. So for every iteration, if I move this up into the into the loop, then I could just change the prompt mid flight. So actually, let's do that. Um, so let's do that. Put that here. So now, while it's iterating, I can change the prompt mid-flight without having to cancel it. Um, that'll be nice.

Long day of work to her loving fiance, miles. Um, jenna and the stranger. When olivia's mom dies, she's left to fend for herself. Um, so this is all this is all very like anglo-centric. These are all like typical, pretty much typically American names. These aren't even like european names. Um, so let me go ahead and pause this now and let's add a little bit of variety. But first we're going to want to change where it starts. Okay, so we're at 16. So let's go here and we'll start um we'll go we'll start at 17 and we'll go up to uh let's see. Let's we'll just go up to 30. and then we'll change this to uh let's close that one. So I stopped clicking on it. Um, for brainstorm a detailed plot synopsis for a random romance. Let's say europe. No, let's say french romance story. Um, and watch how much just one word changes this output. And let's see make sure that I change the where it starts. So it'll go from 17 to 30. uh, okay, that'll be fine.

Okay, so because basically what we're doing now is we're um, elise there we go, dashing parisian gentleman pierre. Oh, wonderful. Um, okay, so what we're doing is we're generating synthetic data right now. So ultimately this will be the input that we use in the future. Why is it paused? There we go. Oh, wow, that's a much longer one. Excellent. Um, so you know we got 17 like you know, white bred american um, premise romance plots. Um, and we're gonna use those to generate um, like a three-act structure in a little bit. Um, but we want variety, right? We don't want just anglo-centric american stories. We want a variety. So um, oh look at that name, antoinette gautier. Ha, love this. Meets brooding so there's another problem. Um meats breeding artist cloud monet. Oh, wow, look at that. Look at that. This is great. Okay, sorry, I'm just really happy really excited about this. The goal the reason why they're numbered is because we got to get up to 200 total. Um, so 200 total, that's going to be enough for us to uh for us to um, what am I
