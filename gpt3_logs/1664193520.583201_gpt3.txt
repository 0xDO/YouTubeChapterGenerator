The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: it's invisible to us because we don't see it when it works and that's actually most AI if AI is good you don't notice it because something just pops into your news feed whether it's Twitter or Facebook or Google news feed or whatever and it's directly relevant to you that's artificial intelligence running in the background and some of it is very sophisticated some of it isn't some of it is just you know some basic pattern matching some of it is very sophisticated anyways rambling the point is that as these models get smaller and more efficient and the hardware gets better you're going to be able to run everything on your phone before too long which means you own all the data and you can decouple from you know the Amazons and the Googles and the microsofts and so we will get to a future kind of more like Star Wars where you can have your own Droid right and your Droid is just a self-contained you know robot that you own and you own its data and you own its labor um that's going to be possible sooner rather than later and I'm surprised at how much we've how much acceleration we've seen this year okay so that was a bramble let me check on the comments to see let's see we got Adrian jumped in was just testing the collab um so yeah Adrian if you uh if you post some some comments or something if you put it over in Discord because I'm monitoring Discord too um you can you can uh chat in real time and I'll share any any ideas or thoughts that you guys have um but yeah so that was the first thing um so yeah now I'm talking I was talking about uh an AI saturated future where between having more Hardware or better hardware and smaller models we'll get to a point where we have um we have even more AI just everywhere um let's see so the other big thing was I had a chance to speak with the with a couple of of the folks from Tau earlier so tell if you're not familiar is let me bring up their home page so I can just read off of it um so it's a it's a it's a it's a Dao that it's t-a-u um and it's a Dao is a distributed autonomous Network or autonomous organization um but it's not just a Dao like so Adele um is a way to basically uh run some kind of organization you can run a private company you could run a church you could run a small town whatever you can run it um with it and it's a it's a system of governance right because uh it runs on blockchain which gives you either a public or private distributed Ledger so all the officers and the governance and the rules everything can be integrated into a distributed autonomous organization and then all the rules are executed programmatically so the governance doesn't even require enforcement from outside authorities it is a self-stabilizing governance okay great so what is the differentiating factor of Tau right there's it it has it's a distributed autonomous organization they've got a cryptocurrency okay great like how does that what's different about it from everything else the differentiating factor of tau is that they are integrating distributed artificial intelligence and a number of other things now Distributing code that's nothing entirely new you can do this with ethereum as well so ethereum is by far the most the biggest most popular blockchain technology right now VMware is they have their uh their blockchain which is based on ethereum um in in private beta right now so you know this is being commercially deployed but the difference is that the Tau network is meant to be self upgrading and so it's not just a matter of executing code on nodes in the network it is a matter of through consensus because that's another thing that blockchains can do is through consensus the network itself can be modified okay great what does that mean right like this is that just sounds like okay sure like you can modify the network uh does that mean like adding nodes or changing what those nodes do so the implications of this are not immediately apparent when you look at recent stuff like pedals so petals was um just announced I don't know when it was announced but in the last few days um so petals is a way of Distributing um uh large language models so if you remember folding at home uh or seti at home this was where you would run a node on your computer and you'd process work from universities basically to do science pedals is a way to do that with large language models but you can participate in a peer-to-peer Network to run large language models this there are plenty of other people working on Distributing these kinds of workloads so you take that idea where you can run artificial intelligence workloads such as large language models code generating models that sort of thing you embed that into a blockchain into a dow and then you add the consensus mechanism and a few other things there's there's a bunch of other Technologies there's a specification language component that goes into it a few other things um but basically what that means is that any code or any capability you want Tau to do the network and everyone on that Network can work on it and come to consensus so that means if everyone on that Network says hey we want to you know uh we want the Tau Network to now include an AI agent that does you know that does voice chat you can work on that and that can come to fruition and the the compute of it is distributed on all the nodes as well as all the all the uh all the layers of the whatever neural networks need to be um included in that um other changes that you can make so say for instance that's the network upgrading itself okay great we come to consensus we give the Tau Network new capabilities that's just it's circular right it's insular not necessarily true so one thing that stands out to me about Tau is that say for instance you want to um you want to upgrade the Tau Network so that it can reach out and touch other apis let's say for instance uh you have an instance of Tau that is running a small town and then you say okay well let's let's expose an API for

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Invisible AI is all around us, working behind the scenes to make our lives easier. From curating our social media feeds to providing relevant search results, AI is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. As AI technology improves and becomes more efficient, it will soon be possible to run everything on our phones. This shift will allow us to decouple from the big tech companies and take control of our own data. In the future, we will see more self-contained AI agents, like the droids in Star Wars, that we can own and operate.

I had a chance to speak with the folks from Tau earlier, and they are working on integrating distributed artificial intelligence into their blockchain platform. This means that the Tau network will be able to self-upgrade, adding new capabilities as they are consensus. This is a significant departure from other blockchain technologies, which are largely static. The implications of this are far-reaching and could eventually lead to Tau becoming the go-to platform for AI development.
