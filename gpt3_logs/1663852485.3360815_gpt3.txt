0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:16:13.760,0:16:18.000
so what we're going to do is we're going
to add just a little bit to the end of the
0:16:18.000,0:16:24.800
prompt so we'll say prompt equals prompt
plus we'll do one more new line jacks
0:16:25.600,0:16:34.560
and so basically what that'll make it look like is
this so it we're basically we're basically priming
0:16:34.560,0:16:39.760
the next line because one thing that can happen
this this is doing pretty well not to do this
0:16:39.760,0:16:46.720
but one thing that can happen is if you don't
have this here it might like continue the user's
0:16:46.720,0:16:52.960
side see how what it did here is if i took out
the um the question mark it added in the question
0:16:52.960,0:16:59.680
mark for me and then continued with jax but let's
say you didn't want that um and you just say jax
0:17:02.640,0:17:07.200
see it's a little bit different so you got to be
very careful about the text that you pass back
0:17:07.760,0:17:14.640
okay so we we uh we we load our prompt we populate
it with the text block of the conversation
0:17:14.640,0:17:22.720
and we say okay jax you're up so now what now we
do response actually here we've already got that
0:17:22.720,0:17:29.280
code here so response equals gpt3 completion
prompt so this is going to be jax's answer
0:17:30.400,0:17:33.280
and so what we'll do is we will do print
0:17:36.320,0:17:44.480
jacks and then we'll do comma response so print
allows you to print multiple variables at once
0:17:44.480,0:17:48.880
so we're basically printing two string variables
and when you put a comma between it it basically
0:17:48.880,0:17:53.600
just acts like a space it won't work if you do
this because it's like i don't know how to how to
0:17:53.600,0:18:01.760
view these two things so we just do jax comma
response great so but don't we need to accumulate
0:18:01.760,0:18:07.600
jax's end of the conversation in the text block
and the in the list absolutely because if we
0:18:07.600,0:18:13.200
don't it's just going to talk be talking to itself
and our it will we're only right now we're only
0:18:13.200,0:18:19.680
recording our side of the conversation um okay
so then what we'll do is we'll do conversation
0:18:19.680,0:18:27.840
dot append and we'll make this look exactly
like this one except we'll change this to jax
