0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:04:02.220,1:04:11.100
from there it should be translated to formal
logic which is a mathematical expression and
1:04:11.100,1:04:17.220
from there all logical reasoning tasks like
detecting contradictions or consensus and so on
1:04:19.020,1:04:23.400
will be done automatically by the
very algorithms that we develop
1:04:25.620,1:04:29.280
to show that the language is
decidable which is what we do
1:04:30.780,1:04:34.620
we come up with algorithm
that decides the language
1:04:36.600,1:04:44.400
and maybe um it is a point to mention
a major difficulty in this whole field
1:04:45.780,1:04:53.700
and which is the necessity the rare necessity
to very much combine Theory with engineering
1:04:55.620,1:05:02.880
logic is a very deep Theory and it's it
is also very computationally intensive
1:05:03.420,1:05:07.080
naive implementation of logic is
not going to work in real life
1:05:07.800,1:05:13.500
you need extremely good engineering as well
as extremely good theory and surprisingly or
1:05:13.500,1:05:17.460
not this combination is very rare
in the software development world
1:05:20.460,1:05:29.940
and I guess this is one of our strength points
and indeed we invest a lot in both forms
1:05:35.220,1:05:41.460
so once you once you said well thank you both
for for helping break that that down from
1:05:42.300,1:05:46.560
um you know from language controlled
language formal logic and so on
1:05:48.540,1:05:56.220
so let's let's expand this or maybe look
at it from a different angle in terms of
1:05:56.940,1:06:00.600
um so we've you know we've talked about the
the talmata language the Tau language we've
1:06:00.600,1:06:05.880
talked about the problems of uh of distributed
development of software and as you mentioned
1:06:05.880,1:06:11.940
getting getting to those specifications those
those purely logical Expressions as to what
1:06:11.940,1:06:18.180
you know the what we want it to do but that's
not where the Tau Network ends right that's
1:06:18.180,1:06:24.780
actually just kind of step one and after that
as you talked about before how do we get to
1:06:24.780,1:06:32.160
the to the how how does it do that how does the
network arrive at the actual new software that
1:06:32.160,1:06:37.680
you know once once people have expressed their
requirements um and then you know as you also
1:06:37.680,1:06:42.300
mentioned uh you fight you find the points
of agreement right where do the requirements
1:06:42.300,1:06:47.160
overlap where do they agree so then what's the
next step once you find those specifications
1:06:48.300,1:06:57.660
how do we how do we get to the how of the software
yeah so starting with the directions analogy
1:06:59.160,1:07:07.080
um so one says I want to go to a supermarket
and the other says I want to go to a restaurant
1:07:08.580,1:07:13.620
they see this to the computer so Google
Maps prepares a route that goes to a
1:07:13.620,1:07:21.420
supermarket and through a restaurant and
then the self-driving car execute the South
1:07:22.860,1:07:29.460
so indeed after people say what they have to say
we automatically calculate the agreement we get
1:07:29.460,1:07:35.640
some kind of specification we automatically run
the specification so that's yet another point
1:07:36.420,1:07:40.620
the specification is
executable indeed automatically
1:07:44.160,1:07:50.400
so this the specification is Excel it is
itself already executable it doesn't need to be
1:07:50.400,1:07:58.500
translated to python or C or anything like that
that's right well there should be some program
1:07:58.500,1:08:06.180
that takes the specification and runs it so you
can look at it implicitly as translating it to
1:08:06.180,1:08:11.940
machine code okay but just like you
know Java python that you mentioned
1:08:13.140,1:08:17.040
they're also not compiled languages
there's some interpreter the constant
1:08:18.360,1:08:21.540
same here we will be interpreter
that runs the Tau language
1:08:23.460,1:08:29.760
excellent I guess excellent by pushing the Google
Maps metaphor right this is exactly what the AI
1:08:29.760,1:08:36.180
does so you really say I want to go from A to
B or even take a robot or Google Maps whatever
1:08:36.180,1:08:44.520
and that's all you have to say then the system
finds the execution path so this is the path and
