0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:22:20.940,1:22:26.460
in the towel language Town meta language and
then implement it and how would that work or
1:22:26.460,1:22:30.240
how would that look and obviously it'll take a
little while to get to something like that but
1:22:30.240,1:22:34.920
is that the kind of thing you know because
that's something I can imagine is that the
1:22:34.920,1:22:40.020
is that the kind of thing that is possible or
feasible you know in the next five to ten years
1:22:42.360,1:22:46.980
well to just Express that of course
you can express but you will need to
1:22:46.980,1:22:52.620
express so much more to reach a level that
the system knows how to achieve it okay
1:22:55.980,1:23:02.700
so there's there's implicit uh prerequisites in
order to achieve that outcome but that outcome
1:23:02.700,1:23:08.880
could be expressed in the Tau Network and
then through the process of uh conversation
1:23:09.900,1:23:16.320
um or negotiation or or exploring those other
requirements to work up to something along those
1:23:16.320,1:23:26.100
lines um or or all the prerequisite steps rather
yes that will take what you tell it as is with no
1:23:26.100,1:23:34.920
modification and no guessing and automatically
draw the conclusions so as long as you gave it
1:23:34.920,1:23:39.840
the means whether explicitly or implicitly
to achieve what you want it will achieve it
1:23:39.840,1:23:45.300
well with the small caveat of the time it
takes the computer to compute such stuff
1:23:45.960,1:23:54.360
but ignoring this caveat it will achieve okay
so the go ahead yeah yeah so just to compliment
1:23:54.360,1:24:01.020
then I guess similarly to what to the success
of current deep neural networks that basically
1:24:01.020,1:24:06.420
they do this analysis statistical analysis
of so many things that were said in the past
1:24:07.500,1:24:12.660
so that they can have an idea what could be
meaningful or what is not having a look what is
1:24:12.660,1:24:18.300
this similarly here but in a completely different
levels because again with the notion of trust
1:24:18.300,1:24:24.480
added is that in order to achieve interesting
conclusion the system has to have knowledge
1:24:25.080,1:24:31.560
so I can imagine that the beginning Tau will
be quite stupid in the sense that it does not
1:24:31.560,1:24:37.560
have a lot of common sense knowledge to to reach
interesting conclusion for us humans in certain
1:24:37.560,1:24:42.060
fields for example if we focus on software
engineering well yes because they don't really
1:24:42.060,1:24:47.460
need Common Sense there but if you make these
examples of nuclear weapons or whatever then
1:24:47.460,1:24:53.340
that's another level of thing however what is
interesting is that people by talking by using
1:24:53.340,1:25:01.020
Tau will uh will add knowledge that since the
common sense knowledge is the knowledge that
1:25:01.020,1:25:05.700
we all of us have even that even though we
don't know that we have but it's this all of
1:25:05.700,1:25:09.180
us it's interesting because somehow it's all this
knowledge that we already have an agreement about
1:25:10.260,1:25:16.620
we all know that elephants don't fly right and
at some point possibly I guess because of this
1:25:16.620,1:25:22.740
consensus mechanism this will be just a fact for
Tau right and so it will build slowly all these
1:25:22.740,1:25:28.080
Common Sense knowledge because everybody agrees
on this implicitly and against this because since
1:25:28.080,1:25:32.520
we are using logic then all this implicit facts
are also important so whatever whenever you make
1:25:32.520,1:25:37.680
a statement that does something implicit well this
is it's not exclusively said but it's true anyway
1:25:37.680,1:25:46.200
because it's implicit uh and so you will that will
grow up and and and acquire all this Common Sense
1:25:46.200,1:25:51.900
knowledge the other thing I wanted to mention is
is the idea of the law of Robotics because Tau can
1:25:51.900,1:25:58.860
also take a very nasty direction if if people want
so maybe the majority wants to vote for having a
1:25:58.860,1:26:03.300
dictator so since they can change the rules they
can change the agreement rules they can change
1:26:03.300,1:26:09.540
how the system evolves they can say Well only if
we get the approval by or your preferred dictator
1:26:09.540,1:26:16.440
so you have this person that because everybody
agrees that they want to pass all the agreements
1:26:16.440,1:26:22.680
through this person or to this agent whatever just
mention example now this means that from now since
1:26:22.680,1:26:27.360
now this is the new mechanism of agreement you
cannot change this right because it's a it's a
