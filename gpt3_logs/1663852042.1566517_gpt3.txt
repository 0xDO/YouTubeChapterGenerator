how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:18:03.280,0:18:13.840
that's one of the most like frustrating
things is the information is in there
0:18:14.800,0:18:16.640
this looks a little bit better okay cool
0:18:19.360,0:18:25.600
or she wakes her up from her dream okay i don't
think this is sufficient but you know blah blah
0:18:25.600,0:18:34.400
it tells us most of the story okay so go save
this and this will be outlines alice in wonderland
0:18:36.800,0:18:40.720
okay you've seen the process i'm going to do
this for all five books just that way we have a
0:18:41.520,0:18:47.920
a summary or outline or synopsis to feed in so
that that way the the auto muse generator knows
0:18:47.920,0:18:52.320
where the story is going all right i'm gonna
pause the video again and we'll come back once
0:18:52.320,0:18:58.000
i've done some scripting okay i've got the first
script uh well started i just want to show you
0:18:58.000,0:19:05.280
what it does um so that you understand um as we go
uh this is a really short thing i had to find this
0:19:05.280,0:19:11.760
module but it's just called text wrap and what it
does is it splits splits strings and python into
0:19:12.400,0:19:18.560
whatever size chunk you want so what i
do is i open open the book just as a text
0:19:19.360,0:19:24.960
as a string and then i break it into 1500
character chunks and the output so far looks
0:19:24.960,0:19:32.240
like this so i just run book to chunks and it says
alice in wonderland.text 110 chunks frankenstein
0:19:32.240,0:19:41.360
293 great gatsby 194 pride and prejudice 518 is a
long story sherlock 389 okay so we'll have a bunch
0:19:41.360,0:19:50.000
of sequential chunks in order to play with this
excuse me um yeah so we're off to a good start
0:19:50.000,0:19:56.800
these chunks for reference they're gonna go here
so basically the um the the outline which was
0:19:56.800,0:20:03.600
already generated let me show you the outlines um
so the outlines are here so we've got an outline
0:20:03.600,0:20:10.160
for each of these that'll go up at the top so
the story outlines so every every time you input
0:20:10.960,0:20:17.040
this um gpt3 because here's the thing gpt3 has no
long-term memory everything that it needs to know
0:20:17.040,0:20:24.880
has to be in every single input this is where
human brains are far superior to gpt3 so
