The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with a uh another tutorial video so i know we've started with python and i'll show you something in a minute but um one thing that has come to my attention is that uh what we really need is some some basics with prompt engineering so if you're new to um to gpt3 uh and large language models the first thing that you need to know is that these are fundamentally just autocomplete engines so you know how like you have your phone and it will have like the recommended next word it's not much different than that it's just this is infinitely more sophisticated um the model i think i always get this number wrong but it takes about 700 gigabytes of ram to run whereas your keyboard takes you know a few megabytes so this is like several thousand times larger of an auto complete engine but at the end of the day it's just an auto complete engine so let me show you what i mean this is the original davinci model which is also one of the harder ones to use because it has no fine tuning in order to make it more instruction friendly and so in this case you usually have to do you either have to allow it to auto complete what you've done or you have to give it a few examples which is called few shot prompting so we're going to start with the old stuff because if you build up an intuition for understanding that it's an autocomplete engine and that's it you'll understand how to use these models a lot better so we say bbc news china has tested their latest fusion reactor and then we just say go and see what it does um oh interesting so the last time i ran this it did something else um it looks like in this case it's listing a bunch of different news articles so this if you go to like news.google.com this is kind of what it looks like right where it's got you know the the source and then and then a title that's not what i expected it to do so let's run it again because this is just one way that it could auto complete it let's run it again and see what happens ah see now it's actually writing an article so you see how it seems at first bluff it might be completely random but what it's doing is it's matching a pattern let's see so china has tested their latest fusion reactor and it seems to be successful this will be a huge step for the country in the world you know etc etc and it gives me a youtube um link let's see let's see if this is actually a video nope not available okay so anyways it's an auto complete engine so this is what's called zero shot so zero shot is when you don't give it any examples you just want it to complete something so this was for a news article now if i give it instructions like write a uh a short story about an astronaut going to mars this is probably not going to work um see it's just it doesn't understand what i'm asking and it's just repeating it um let's do it again yeah so it's like giving instructions it's like no i actually wanted to write something like can you write the story for me um but if we reframe it like um we'll let's call it uh uh uh um uh jordan's mission to mars um a short story by uh let's say jimi hendrix i don't know um there once was a an astronaut named jordan and then let's see what happens there we go so by giving it just a little bit uh to start off with um it kind of went yeah the this looks like it was written by a little kid there was once an astronaut named jordan jordan was a brave astronaut who was the first astronaut on mars he was the first astronaut to ever walk on mars jordan was walking along the surface of mars he was walking on a sandy desert the planet looked so red yeah this is like written by a little kid so that's the best it could do to match that pattern now let's run it again and see what happens but you can see that it's just um oh this looks like a little more sophisticated but anyways so by cueing it up the end by kayla grady and it's a short story by jimi hendrix so i forgot what it was talking about anyways all right so this is zero shot where you basically you you spool it up by giving it something and then you just let it run like an auto complete engine um and so in that respect it's just a statistical model but what if you what if you have a very specific pattern that you want it to follow so you might say like um uh brainstorm um uh let's see a list of ideas to uh let's see a list of ideas of ways to survive on mars so this is something that it's probably seen in its training data like on reddit or stack exchange or whatever and so then if we do this what would you need to bring so it's not it's just asking questions it's not actually answering them so that's no good right let's do it again and see if we can get it to oh there we go okay um oh look and so then it starts it goes off matt damon [Laughter] yeah so then it completely changes topic and it's like well that's not what i wanted i wanted this list right um gather water from the water crystals okay get oxygen from the oxygen crystals this is so random find a way to grow food um find a way to build a radio so that okay so you can see where it was just like okay it just kind of goes off the rails and runs with it this was original da vinci um so how do you get it to do what you want well so what you can do then is one shot um so what i've shown you up to this point is zero shot where it's just like let me just give you an initial prompt and treat you like an autocomplete engine just like you know you hit the next thing on your your keyboard and let it go and see what happens um now what you can do then is what's called a one shot prompt so one shot prompt is where you give it one example of what you want and then and then you uh then you set it free so then i give it an example brainstorm a list i have ideas of how to survive on mars so now let's brainstorm a list of ideas of ways to survive on a deserted island okay so in this case it's called one shot because i give it one example of what i need and then because it's basically a pattern

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro demonstrates how to use GPT3 to generate a list of ideas for surviving on a deserted island. He starts by giving the model a zero-shot prompt, which simply means letting it auto-complete based on the initial prompt. This results in a list of articles that are unrelated to the prompt. He then shows how to give the model a one-shot prompt, which is where you give it one example of what you want it to do. This results in a more targeted list of ideas, including gathering water from the water crystals and finding a way to build a radio.
