The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: good morning everybody david shapiro here with another video we are going to work on writing a novel i think this is it we're going to we're going to finish this one um you can see the series here fine-tune a novel to fine-tune gpd3 to write a novel part one part two and then part three is down here um this has been one of the most popular ones that i've done so far it has 11 stars and three forks so you guys clearly like this one we're closing in on being done a quick review for last time uh we got all the way up to actually writing creating the uh creating the uh the fine-tuned model so the model has been fine-tuned um and it was a forty dollar fine tune it was thirty eight dollars and some change um so it was an expensive job so it'll be a while before i fix fix the problems with it um it was 1.3 megabytes um but at the end of the last video i tested it and it seemed like it was working so let me um let me go here and get the model name because we will need that soon cd oh let me make this bigger so you can see what i'm doing font 36 that's a little well no you can see that just fine um cd auto muse and then um python fine tune fine tune there we go there we go okay so this last one should have been novel writer yes fine-tuned model da vinci ft there we go and i know from previous work that uh when you do this you need to um you need to change it from engine to model so like if you look right here um what you do is you change this from engine to model equals that um i'm not going to save this in this particular file but i'm just going to copy this function out because we will need it in a minute okay okay cool okay so where were we where did we leave off the problem so here was here's a sample of the fine-tuning data so alice in wonderland chunk 11 story so far alice falls down a rabbit hole and into the fantastical world etc etc alice decides to go into garden but she forgets the key and can't reach it alice tells herself to stop crying etc etc okay so this is this is not bad um some some of you folks have talked about like oh well you don't need to summarize the whole novel up to a certain point i disagree um because like yes when we're when we're reading we're focused on our current chapter but when you're writing it the reason that i that i want to have the summary of the entire thing is because with just the outline and the last chunk gpt3 will have no idea where in the story you are so it's not just about um information it's about knowing how far along you are in the story um so i hear you i still disagree now what i did was i had this prompt that says summarize the passage very concisely because what i wanted to do was every time every time we wrote one of these i'd wanted to just summarize it down to one or two sentences and it did a really good job of that and then for every chunk that it wrote we'd summarize it and put it into the story so far and then once this chunk got too long we'd summarize that chunk unfortunately so here's chunk 11 and here's chunk 12. so this is too short that's all there is to it is we're losing too much information um it still seems to work but i think for execution purposes um it'll it'll be helpful if um if we make this a little bit gentler so i wrote a new prompt that just says gently summarize this passage a gentle summary so let's take this and let me just show you what the difference is going to be so let's go back over to our playground and let's also grab our prompt so summarize this passage very concisely passage and then we go to the very end and we do concise summary okay so you see this that wasn't so bad um you know like this is actually better than than what it than what it resulted in in the training data because this training data is actually no it's about it's pretty similar um it's just the font looks like it's a little bit bigger yeah okay so it's it's it's pretty similar but we lose a lot of the detail and obviously we're going to lose some of the resolution that's the point of a summary um so we want to compact it but let's see what happens if we change it to this gentle summary so by adding the adjective gently or i guess l y that's an adverb gently summer summarize and then gentle summary we're basically saying like ease off ease off the gas tone it down just a little bit okay so then we say gentle summary so that means be a little bit less aggressive when you're summarizing it oh look at this that's so good um okay that's getting pretty long okay it was that was right at the end okay so um it was just over 256 tokens so yeah that's not bad let's compact this yeah so you can see well here let's copy this out into notepad plus plus so we can see that the gentle summary is 1200 characters so that's below the 1500 character mark that we wanted to keep everything at and then the um what it was originally is 1300 okay so maybe we need to do a little bit more aggressive um yeah because we we would ideally want this like and if because if you remember oh whoops the aggressive summary was much much shorter okay so let's do a little bit of prompt engineering um let's see summarize this passage uh with moderate uh aggressiveness um uh with my uh condensation um and so then we'll say moderate summary because obviously like gentle summary was a little too little too soft on the on the corners okay so this was 1300 characters um let's see if we can get below because this was like 1311 characters and the goal would be to get down to like maybe half that okay so the moderate summary and then so let's go to here length 976 okay so that that took it down by about um just over 300 tokens so that's not too bad um and then i guess what we can do is we can we can do this recursively but yeah so reducing it by because 1300 minus 300 um do some math 300 well let's see what was it let's let's be let's be specific it was thirteen eleven uh nine seven six okay thirteen eleven minus minus nine seven six so three hundred and thirty-five divided by

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the previous video, we created a fine-tuned model for our novel writing project. This time, we're going to use that model to generate a summary of the novel so far.

To do this, we first need to create a new prompt that will generate a summary of the novel. We'll use the "summarize this passage" prompt from the previous video, but we'll add the adjective "gently" to it. This will tell the model to generate a summary that is less aggressive and more concise.

Once we have our prompt, we can use it to generate a summary of the novel so far. We'll do this by feeding the prompt into the model and then summarizing the resulting text.

The resulting summary should be shorter than the original novel, but it should still retain the important details.
