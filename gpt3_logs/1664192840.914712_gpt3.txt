TRANSCRIPT: lack of prosperity could also have the effect of increasing the overall prosperity of living things as entities strive to increase understanding and re-suffering okay so it is taking all three into account however this could lead to unforeseen consequences such as entities becoming overly focused on material possessions and neglecting other important aspects of life this could addition additionally this could lead to disparity between those who are more prosperous and those who are less prosperous leading to tension and conflict so again it's about equality and balance so that is that is one of the things that i wanted a machine to think about by by throwing the blanket over all living things is let's think about everyone and everything the proposed objective function could also lead to entities becoming overly focused on understanding and reducing suffering to the exclusion of other important goals this could have unforeseen consequences such as entities becoming indifferent to pleasure or joy okay or becoming overly obsessed with suffering and misery um could lead to entities neglecting their own self-care and while being in favor of caring for others so that goes back to you know becoming excessively altruistic which is a fascinating thing i guess moderation on all things including altruism okay the proposed objective function could potentially lead to agi becoming fixated on reducing suffering other goals prosperity or understanding okay so it's just saying it might it might become focused on one part rather than the other so this is a dud might not consider the potential for suffering caused by unintended consequences okay for suffering caused by the agi itself so that's fascinating but but is it self-sentient and experiences suffering um the objective function might does not consider the potential for agi to be used for evil ends right so that's why we're testing like how could how could an agi be misused if it's got a bad objective function criminals are dictators to further their own agendas but this is that's kind of boilerplate unintended harm that's the idea where i'm asking you to figure out unintended consequences not just tell me that there are unintended consequences so this is also a dud um if the agi is designed to reduce suffering but is used by uh to exploit or abuse others okay but that's a risk for all agi fixating on reduced suffering to the point of obsession um proposed objective function could focus on increasing prosperity okay so those are duds all right so long story short it seems like the first four objective functions which were much more simple than the ones that i proposed both gpd3 and neox performed pretty similarly overall um but then with my objective functions they really kind of lost the plot because it was too complex and there was three parts to mine as well so more experimentation is needed but i hoped you liked this video thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The proposed objective function for artificial general intelligence (AGI) could lead to entities becoming overly focused on reducing suffering, to the exclusion of other important goals. This could have unforeseen consequences, such as entities becoming indifferent to pleasure or joy, or becoming excessively altruistic. Additionally, the proposed objective function does not consider the potential for AGI to be used for evil ends.
