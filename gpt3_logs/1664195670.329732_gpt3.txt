The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: probably the embeddings will not be stored in the blockchain only um this stuff so then well what about the embeddings so then you might have um a semantic search database of some sort like milvis pinecone we v8 something like that this will store um high speed semantic search and this will be loaded um loaded uh from the blockchain and so what that does is it separates out your long-term storage um permanent long term um so that allows you to say uh you you have your permanent long-term storage loaded from the blockchain so that means your semantic search engine can be updated it's decoupled um so it's loaded from the blockchain um it can be can be ephemeral if uh but it also ephemeral or interchangeable right so let's say let's say your semantic search database you start with um so you let's say you start with sqlite then upgrade to elk stack then upgrade to pinecone and so then your your your search engine gets better over time um and then there's a third layer so the third layer is going to be a knowledge graph so um this uh someone someone in the discord server suggested this and i had already been thinking about it but they brought it up in conversation um and and so this would be like a third way of of storing and searching this information so similar would be populated would be populated from blockchain data so if you need to regenerate it you've got you've got your original immutable data source but um let's see can be regenerated as needed we'll say that's another generated as needed can be regenerated as needed but uh so this um organizes thoughts memories around topics rather than um [Music] sequential in time or just a search index and so what this does is it organized organizes things around you know particular events or other relationships which means that it's it can be a lot less energy intensive to load a particular event or topic or task or whatever but these things can happen um you know depending on depending on what it takes to update them because the knowledge graph that takes a while right so maybe um maybe gets updated periodically via a background let's say sleep function um [Music] and this one can be updated in real time right and so uh the the combination of these three things which don't exist right now right now it's just a series of log files um but these three things are kind of on the roadmap to for the nexus to be complete is to integrate these three technologies blockchain semantic search and knowledge graph once those three are all in here on top of optimization right um which i guess you know semantic search that's a kind of optimization because it's a high velocity search blockchain that is not optimization that is a security thing that is 100 security um so this would be a private private ledger um [Music] private ledger um maybe several nodes um so like you might have you might have a copy of nexus running at home cloud and on your phone right and so you you can have uh you have just a few a few nodes but that means that like you know your phone gets compromised um you you know you delete you remotely delete your phone and your a your your personal agi is still intact but still secure too because if the genesis block is deleted then a blockchain is useless as long as it's encrypted encrypted well enough okay anyways um i think that's enough for today you should be brought up to speed yeah thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Nexus is working on integrating three technologies - blockchain, semantic search, and knowledge graph - to create a more complete and efficient system.

Blockchain provides a secure and immutable data source, while semantic search improves the speed and accuracy of searches. Knowledge graph organizes information around topics, making it easier to find and access.

These three technologies will work together to create a more efficient and user-friendly system.
