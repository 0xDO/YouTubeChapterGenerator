0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:03.840,0:04:11.680
oops synthesize slots there we go okay so this
is this is showing you the the prompts that it's
0:04:11.680,0:04:17.840
going to run so it starts with a uuid up at the
top a uu id is just a random string of hexadecimal
0:04:17.840,0:04:26.720
characters but one thing that i found is that this
does a really good job of of causing gpt3 to have
0:04:26.720,0:04:32.000
a little bit more internal entropy by starting
it with a uuid it's like okay i'm reading this i
0:04:32.000,0:04:36.320
don't i don't know how to make sense of it so it's
trying to create an internal state that doesn't
0:04:36.320,0:04:41.840
make any sense so you you you prime it to be a
little bit more different a little bit more random
0:04:42.560,0:04:46.560
this is especially good if you need to run
the same prompt over and over and over again
0:04:46.560,0:04:50.640
so you do this in combination with a high
temperature and you'll get a lot more variety
0:04:51.280,0:04:55.440
but anyways you can see where it's populated
out imagine a complete and detailed plot outline
0:04:55.440,0:05:00.320
for a science fiction film set in india during
the 1990s the story should be supernatural and
0:05:00.320,0:05:06.400
otherworldly write out the entire plot write
out the entire plot outline in great detail
0:05:08.320,0:05:13.760
and then you see the number here 256. so if you
go back here you say i just did a quick count
0:05:13.760,0:05:17.440
to keep track of how many it generated just
to show you that's what it's doing so we can
0:05:17.440,0:05:23.280
comment this out since we don't need this
um and then what we'll do is i have some
0:05:23.280,0:05:29.680
some canned functions that i use so here's the uh
here's the gpt3 completion um use text davinci o2
0:05:29.680,0:05:34.640
temperature one top p of one token's a thousand
it's not generating anywhere near that much
0:05:35.200,0:05:42.080
um and then we'll save we'll save all this out to
gpt3 logs but then what are we going to do with
0:05:42.080,0:05:46.960
the actual prompt and completion right because
for fine tuning you need a prompt and a completion
0:05:46.960,0:05:50.640
and we're not going to just record these
prompts what would be the point of that
0:05:51.440,0:05:55.200
we're not actually adding anything so
what we got to do is we're going to then
