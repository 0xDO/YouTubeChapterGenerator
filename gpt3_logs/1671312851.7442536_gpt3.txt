0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:16:17.040,0:16:21.900
I said unpause okay I think it was just frozen
so because I refresh the screen and it's fine
0:16:22.920,0:16:28.020
um okay so I'm saying how can I code a knowledge
graph says manually build a Knowledge Graph if you
0:16:28.020,0:16:33.780
have a small amount of data to do so you can build
it by creating nodes in the entities you can also
0:16:33.780,0:16:39.900
use a tool like graphis or gephy to visualize
and edit your knowledge graph interesting okay
0:16:40.860,0:16:44.700
use an NLP tool that's exactly what
I'm going to do a graph database okay
0:16:44.700,0:16:51.840
use natural uh to use a pre-existing
Knowledge Graph cool so I wonder what
0:16:51.840,0:16:58.980
kind of format these guys take I wonder if
it knows so neo4j or Amazon Neptune cool
0:17:00.060,0:17:12.660
um let's see what uh file format um is a knowledge
graph um like can I use Json or something
0:17:15.900,0:17:19.380
let's see there are a number of different file
formats you can use to represent a Knowledge
0:17:19.380,0:17:26.220
Graph some common ones are graphml and XML
based file format okay graph is guessing
0:17:26.220,0:17:32.760
y Ed okay rdf the resource description I don't
know anything about knowledge graphs other than
0:17:32.760,0:17:39.780
the theory Json LD is a lightweight linked data
format that can be used to do that CSV really
0:17:40.320,0:17:48.360
CSV is simple on one row per relationship with
columns for the source and Target nodes okay
0:17:50.880,0:17:54.420
um I am personally a big fan of
Json because it's human readable
0:17:55.080,0:17:59.700
CSV is human readable but it's a little bit
on the Messier side especially when you get
0:17:59.700,0:18:10.200
really complicated so uh can you give me
an example of a Json lb Knowledge Graph
0:18:12.060,0:18:22.380
um let's say uh for instance I want to see
um some nodes about the history of uh France
0:18:23.760,0:18:26.760
I'm kind of a Francophile I've visited
France and I really love it there
0:18:28.800,0:18:33.600
okay sure here's an example
of Json LD um all right
0:18:36.900,0:18:44.040
so it looks like each node is actually pretty
simple where it's got an ID a type a name and
0:18:44.040,0:18:50.040
a description that's actually really
simple um nationality oh interesting
0:18:50.040,0:18:55.440
it looks like the some of the things
are kind of arbitrary French Revolution
0:18:58.320,0:18:59.100
start date
0:19:03.600,0:19:04.920
Napoleon Bonaparte
0:19:08.640,0:19:12.660
but yeah I really I really like it
uh France won the culture so when I
0:19:12.660,0:19:16.560
visited while this is running I'll tell you
a little bit about France uh when I visited
0:19:18.120,0:19:25.020
yeah okay sure um so when I when I
I visited France uh 10 years ago in
0:19:25.020,0:19:33.660
2012 and what I really like okay here
we go um let's see how uh does Json
0:19:34.740,0:19:45.480
LD establish relationships I don't see any
examples of um Connections in the above example
0:19:46.560,0:19:55.440
okay so while it's telling me um the at ID oh
okay so all right it'll it'll explain anyways
0:19:55.440,0:20:02.400
so the culture in France is somewhat similar to
America in um in that uh we both think very highly
0:20:02.400,0:20:09.180
of ourselves um but there are some really Stark
differences and namely the pace of life in France
0:20:10.260,0:20:17.040
um where you know sure if you go to the big cities
like Paris it's rush rush rush um but if you get
0:20:17.040,0:20:22.620
outside of Paris even in some of the larger cities
people just have a different attitude towards life
0:20:23.760,0:20:30.240
um you know they're the the the the portion
meal portion sizes are smaller and um other
0:20:30.240,0:20:36.780
other things like that but then it's like people
are less in a hurry um and then um I hear that
0:20:36.780,0:20:41.160
Italy is even worse where it's just like nothing
happens quickly in Italy so maybe it's just a
0:20:41.160,0:20:47.220
European thing anyways um it's very refreshing to
see a modern powerful Nation because France is the
0:20:47.220,0:20:54.180
number three exporter of like military hardware
or something I don't remember but like this is a
0:20:54.180,0:20:58.800
powerful modern country that has a much slower
pace of life and a different attitude towards
