0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:05:31.980,0:05:38.700
okay I sent in feedback um let's see
what we've got so import OS split text
0:05:38.700,0:05:43.140
files input folder output folder pages
per chunk so good it's parameterized it
0:05:44.340,0:05:52.380
um if not uh output folder make it nice
okay for file and Os Lister input folder
0:05:53.640,0:06:01.680
um with open OS path join input folder file r
as F read it excellent Pages equals split on
0:06:01.680,0:06:08.640
new page perfect so it understood that for I and
chunk enumerate page range zero pages per chunk
0:06:08.640,0:06:14.880
excellent so this is this is a list comprehension
that will break it into equal chunks or chunks
0:06:14.880,0:06:21.840
of four output file equals this underscore
plus oh dang that's good that's good okay
0:06:23.640,0:06:27.060
um this is wonderful so let's go to this
0:06:28.140,0:06:31.080
um I had started writing it and then I
was like I don't have the energy for this
0:06:32.100,0:06:39.360
I'm telling you I have said it on Twitter and
I've said it on mostly Twitter but LinkedIn
0:06:39.360,0:06:44.880
and a few other places English your ability
to describe what you want is going to be the
0:06:44.880,0:06:52.140
primary programming language from now on period
end of story if you can think through a function
0:06:53.340,0:07:02.100
then um yeah this is this is it so let's run
this let's see if this worked um need a command
0:07:02.100,0:07:09.660
prompt CD and we're in the scotus opinions um
and then we'll do python step 01 split chunks
0:07:11.700,0:07:17.460
why you no work um this actually happens
quite a bit let's see if it can fix it
0:07:20.640,0:07:29.460
um so thanks that mostly
worked but through this error
0:07:32.760,0:07:39.060
and you fixed that error please now if this
can debug this I know exactly what it is
0:07:40.800,0:07:44.040
yep yep there you go
0:07:53.700,0:07:57.600
you need to specify the encoding yep perfect
0:08:02.280,0:08:05.460
oh wow okay it's saying add the ignore flag
0:08:08.280,0:08:12.900
wonderful wonderful adding
encoding utf-8 should be sufficient
0:08:15.060,0:08:16.680
um so that goes to do
0:08:18.720,0:08:19.560
right here
0:08:25.920,0:08:28.200
hmm fascinating
0:08:31.860,0:08:33.240
did it get farther
0:08:35.640,0:08:40.980
this is weird though input folder
file contents read encoding utf-8
0:08:40.980,0:08:48.060
as infile so sometimes this happens um
let's see what is the encoding here so
0:08:48.060,0:08:55.020
sometimes what I do is I'll convert it
to something and then I'll convert back
0:08:57.660,0:08:58.260
so let's
0:09:02.400,0:09:04.200
yeah hmm
0:09:07.080,0:09:12.000
I wonder what happens if we do let's
add let's add that ignore thing rather
0:09:12.000,0:09:15.480
than rather than getting lost in the
weeds let's just do errors equal ignore
0:09:18.660,0:09:21.420
because you know what I looked at
the text file it looks fine to me
0:09:23.640,0:09:30.780
oh and let's also see if it um okay it got
pretty far already so it got pretty far in
0:09:30.780,0:09:37.200
the process before blowing up one two three
so now we've got all the chunks cool cool cool
0:09:39.180,0:09:43.980
um all right heck with it send it what do you mean
0:09:47.580,0:09:48.900
this was in
0:09:51.180,0:09:57.240
so this was in Split text files F right
oh it couldn't write it interesting
0:09:59.640,0:10:07.380
oh okay okay okay um so when we write it we
need to we need to convert it to ASCII and back
0:10:08.400,0:10:11.280
um so let's see if it understands this
