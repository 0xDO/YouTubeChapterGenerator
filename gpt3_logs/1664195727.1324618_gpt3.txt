TRANSCRIPT: uh thresholds need to be completely smooth that sort of stuff um we we went to a hotel and i was just like why is this room feel different and she's like oh this is this is disability accessible because all the doors were really wide all the everything was really spacious and the and the there was no thresholds anywhere it was all perfectly smooth and i was like i really like this aesthetic like to me it was an aesthetic thing but it just it felt more accommodating and and that was like oh yeah like if you make it accessible for people in wheelchairs or with other mobility issues it actually becomes more accessible to everyone because the bathroom was really big right and so like the bathroom was big the shower was big um the entry hall was big and i just never felt cramped or claustrophobic um and the same applies to all kinds of stuff um so for instance when we do the podcast we're going to follow a format that is used all over the place this is a format that's used in 12-step programs it's used in conflict mediation it's used in our writing group this is actually where i learned it but basically we're going to have like one person talking or presenting um that'll be for five to fifteen minutes and then what we'll do is we'll do a round robin where everyone gets to share their thoughts and reactions to the presentation one at a time right so we don't have people that are going to be talking over each other we're not going to do crosstalk everyone will get a chance to just speak their mind you know in a minute or two about the topic and then after everyone who wants to have a chance because again some people are going to be shy some people are going to be introverted some people it takes them a while to gather their thoughts not everyone is like you know quick on the draw like like i am i am just ready to talk all the time um and so but by creating a structure that says like okay dave it's not your turn to talk it's this person's turn to talk you make it safer and more accessible to everyone and then once everyone has a chance to talk then we'll switch to um we'll switch to a normal conversation a free-for-all so every topic that we talk about on the on the podcast we'll have three phases there'll be the presentation phase the round robin phase and then the free-for-all phase um yeah okay well unfortunately it looks like nobody jumped into the podcast that's fine i do this spontaneously mostly i just wanted to record this video about rules how to how to run a community um and just yeah uh encourage this this discord community to to keep going we've already got some of like so many incredible people involved we've got lawyers we've got people in all levels of their career and academia we've got people with children people without children we've got we've got artists we've got people that have traveled a lot we've got polyglots um it's just i never in my wildest dreams would i have thought that so many people would gather so quickly and this was like not even my idea like this is what you all asked for um and also like it just hit me yesterday like this is like the people involved already and the people that could become involved like this is um this is a group that can like change the world um and i see myself not as like a leader but as a servant right like i'm just sharing my ideas and then people asked me to create this space where they could come together and talk and that's what i did right and then people asked for um the audio channels for accessibility because some people struggle with typing um or or reading they they prefer verbal communication i was like okay cool i'll do that um then people like wanted a podcast so that way they could digest the whole thing without having to sit on it every day because like some people have children or day jobs or whatever they can't they can't sit in front of a discord channel all day long um and so i see myself more as a like a servant rather than a leader or you know leader as servant anyways i'm rambling now um just wanted to introduce the discord channel my discord server which is the cognitive i cognitive ai lab there we go and then also talk about the upcoming podcast so i think that we're going to be recording the podcast wednesday evening 8 p.m u.s east time and yeah we'll see how it goes obviously this is an evolving process but this is what people wanted and it aligns with my goals professionally and uh and and personally so here we go thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Cognitive AI Lab Discord server is a community of people interested in discussing AI and its implications. The server has been set up so that people can share their thoughts and ideas in a structured way, with three phases to each discussion: presentation, round-robin, and free-for-all.

The presentation phase is where one person talks or presents on a topic for 5-15 minutes. This is followed by a round-robin phase where everyone gets to share their thoughts and reactions to the presentation, one at a time. This ensures that everyone gets a chance to speak, without people talking over each other. After everyone has had a chance to talk, the discussion moves on to the free-for-all phase, where anything goes.

This structure makes it safe and accessible for everyone to participate, regardless of their level of experience or expertise. It also means that the discussion can be more focused and productive, as people are not interrupted or sidetracked.
