TRANSCRIPT: cognitive entity it says like hey you really hurt my feelings um the core objective functions will be like whoa hold on we cause suffering and it'll add messages saying we need to do better next time right so it'll be self-monitoring i've already done all these experiments i know it sounds really fantastical when i say it out loud but i have done the experiments and now i just have to put it into the microservices that's why i'm making this video okay so then what happens so that's that's that's you know first it just looks for messages from the conductor that's why there's the dotted lines um because they don't communicate directly all communication goes through the nexus that is the broker so you can have an arbitrary number of microservices um contributing to your artificial cognitive entities thought um but uh so the conductor just says hey you're you're misbehaving change your you know change your behavior or hey you're doing a good job or this is what we need to focus on um and then you know they do their recall they they pull all the necessary memories from the nexus and do their thing contribute it back okay that's great but then what do they do offline what do they do how do you learn right learning is not one monolithic thing in intelligence your whole brain learns right it's not like oh i have a filing cabinet in my head that's not how learning happens what happens instead is that every section of your brain every component updates right you have parameters and biases and weights or and organic terms synaptic connections that update globally right and so like when you practice something you're forming new global connections all over the place it's not just one like pile of data and so what happens is as there's more data in the nexus what these microservices will do is that they'll pull that data out that says it'll search for data that's relevant to its function so in the case of the core objective functions it'll look for you know cases that it succeeded in reducing suffering it'll look for cases that it failed in reducing suffering and what it'll do is it'll automatically curate those data those um into those memories into data sets and then it will fine-tune newer models in order to improve its performance in the future now another thing that these microservices will do is they're not just going to have one model they're going to have their original model they're going to have every new model that they're trying and what they'll do is they will measure the performance of their own model so this is one thing that i'm writing in my book is that every microservice is going to be responsible for its own performance and that means that each microservice is going to have to have its own objective function or something that it's measuring against and basically that objective function is just how it you what it decides to um how it decides to cultivate and curate those internal data sets and so over time as our artificial cognitive entity gets older the nexus will have more and more memories right it's going to start off with tens of thousands of thoughts and memories and then hundreds of thousands and then millions billions trillions so this is going to need to scale really big which is why i need to integrate the facebook ai semantic search as soon as possible because this is going to be a big search problem so then imagine you've got a trillion data points to to curate new models from right that's great data is fuel for artificial intelligence and so the nexus is going to be responsible for holding all of that data and then these microservices are going to say hey give me this data let me chew on this and learn in the background and then as it trains new models it'll test those models we've already got this in ml ops right there's there's auto ml which allows you to automatically do side by side comparison of models against known known problems known data sets and so it'll need to do all that in the background again because this problem space is so clearly defined for each microservice it shouldn't be that big of a deal i say should i'm probably going to eat my hat on that and so in that respect your core objective functions are going to improve over time but they're also always going to adhere to those three principles then your agent model will also improve over time because as your artificial cognitive entity gains more experiences about what it can and cannot do it'll form a more clear identity a more solid identity as to this is who i am this is how i work this is this is what i'm capable of this is what i'm not capable of there's a there's a slew of other services that i'm planning such as planning services anticipation services and so on but this diagram is um is just kind of like the high level uh of of what i'm doing so uh right now what have i got i've got a uh a prototype version of the nexus what else do i have not a whole lot else other than the core objective functions i've got the experiments here so that's going to be wrapped up into this microservice before too long then i got to work on the conductor i've got all the experiments there anyways i guess i'm repeating myself now so i will go ahead and stop the video now but this is what i'm working on um thanks for watching like and subscribe and um consider supporting me on patreon thanks and have a good day

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I'm working on an artificial cognitive entity that is self-monitoring and constantly improving. The core objective functions of this entity are to reduce suffering and add messages saying we need to do better next time. To do this, the entity pulls memories from a nexus and uses them to contribute to its thoughts. This process is constantly happening, and the entity is also constantly learning from new data sets. Over time, the entity will get better at reducing suffering. Additionally, the entity has its own objective function that it is constantly measuring against. This allows it to fine-tune its models and improve its performance.
