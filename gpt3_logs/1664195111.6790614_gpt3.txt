TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody let's start with a demo um i want to show you why i'm doing all of this i had a conversation recently and i realized that a lot of people are new to my work and what i'm doing so let me show you why i'm doing this um we're gonna fire up starting up i am now fully online raven how can i help hey raven um i'm having a problem with my house can you help me out i will be happy to help what seems to be the problem um well my kitchen is on fire what should i do i would suggest calling the fire department i'm not trained to handle situations like this uh that's a good point okay i'll call them thanks you're welcome is there anything else i can help you with well now that i've left my house i need somewhere to stay what should i do i don't know how to find a hotel let me see what i can do i will search for a hotel in the area and see if they have any vacancies well i don't think you can give me any phone numbers how do i find one should i google it how do i know if it's a good hotel you can't give out any phone numbers as for finding a hotel you can search for one on google or you can ask your friends for recommendations you can also look for reviews online once you find a hotel that you like you can call them to confirm the room is available oh okay that makes sense all right well i found a new problem my car won't start what should i do your car won't start that's not good i'm not qualified to give you advice on that but i'm sure there are plenty of people out there who can help you you can search for a mechanic online or you can ask your friends for recommendations hopefully they can help you good luck all right well i don't have any money so i really need your help when i turn the key it just clicks what does that mean that's not good i'm not an expert on cars but i'm sure there are plenty of people out there who can help you you can search for okay that's that's enough of a demonstration you see what i'm working on um so let me give you a little bit of background um a lot of you folks are new to my channel and you don't know that i've written two books on this topic um so natural language cognitive architecture is the my prototype of a particular type of agi they call artificial cognitive entity it's based on natural language processing the reason is because highest our our highest level thought our highest level abstract of abstraction is in language um and so therefore language is a really great tool to use to um to approximate human thought planning and so on um so for instance we are able to encode very high level concepts very easily um you know say i want to get to the moon right that's just a few words and it gives you a very very clear idea of like what your big objective is um ultimately the goal is well we're going to have machines that are more intelligent than us one day and in some respects uh tools like gpt3 already are more intelligent than us in some ways not always and so the font my follow-up book was benevolent by design which is how do we build a machine that is going to be intrinsically trustworthy um that is my goal uh my my my platform that i'm that i'm creating is called raven or real-time uh real-time uh assistant vastly extensible network so what i've just done is i've given you a demonstration of the mvp of raven so mvp is minimum viable product so basically that means this is the this is the very first version of raven that is you know commercially viable right if you had this on your phone um it could be a useful thing um i the the repo is up here and so i'm not going to go and give you a deep dive of like well actually no i guess i guess i kind of am i was going to say i'm not going to give you a deep dive of how it works but that's really the point of this um so the readme file kind of outlines what is raven raven is a general purpose voice-enabled ai companion now i need to point out that ai companions are not presently approved by openai so this is for experimentation only this is not something that i'm going to try and get approved for for commercial deployment just yet it needs a lot of testing fortunately open ai does allow i think it's up to 10 or 15 testers and i've got that covered so fortunately i'm not accepting any people to apply to be testers i've got plenty of testers already so the ultimate goal of raven is to be an information companion like cortana from halo and there's plenty of other examples there's fictional examples like um the the movie her with joaquin phoenix um that was a great example there's a joie from um or joy from uh from blade runner 1849 another example but the key thing is we need to create something that is going to be benevolent by design something that will be trustworthy so how do we do that from my perspective there are three steps or three stages to that so first is we have to earn user trust through data privacy security reliability and utility it has to be useful right you have to get use out of it and it also has to be reliable you have to you have to be able to reliably get good advice and good direction from an ai tool or an artificial cognitive entity in order for it to earn your trust so once we start there it then has to demonstrate the ability to sell monitor self-check and self-correct so these are all just different components of self-improvement um but basically self-monitoring is something that we humans do so like you know everyone who has social anxiety it's because you're hyper vigilant you're self-monitoring right um if you uh but everyone self-monitors to a certain to a certain degree um and the self-monitoring is monitoring your own behavior and your own thoughts to make sure that you're adhering to some principles or goal and we'll get to those principles in a minute but they're outlined in this book and then in order to self-check so self-monitoring is before you act self-check is is when you check okay did my action have the tended result yes or no and then if it didn't you self-

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Artificial cognitive entities, or ACEs, are a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on natural language processing. This allows them to better approximate human thought. ACEs have the potential to be more intelligent than humans in some ways, and so it is important to build them in a way that is trustworthy.

There are three steps to building an ACE that is benevolent by design: earning user trust, demonstrating the ability to self-monitor, self-check, and self-correct, and adhering to principles of beneficence.

Earning user trust is essential for an ACE to be successful. This can be done through data privacy, security, reliability, and utility. The ACE must be useful to the user in order to earn their trust. It also must be reliable, so that the user can rely on it for good advice and direction.

Once trust is established, the ACE must demonstrate the ability to self-monitor, self-check, and self-correct. Self-monitoring is the ability to monitor one's own thoughts and actions to ensure that they align with a goal. Self-checking is the ability to check whether an action had the intended result. If not, the ACE must be able to correct itself.

Adhering to principles of beneficence is also important for an ACE. Beneficence is the principle of doing good. An ACE that is benevolent by design will do what is good for the user, not just what the user wants.

By following these steps, it is possible to build an artificial intelligence that is trustworthy and beneficial.
