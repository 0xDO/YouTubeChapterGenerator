0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:09:29.280,0:09:34.920
conceptual and methodological um topics that we'll
delve into in just a little bit about how to solve
0:09:34.920,0:09:41.220
those problems uh Professor franconi did you have
any um anything to add to kind of the overall goal
0:09:41.220,0:09:49.740
of the Tau Network well uh when you have this goal
of involving so many agents participating to this
0:09:49.740,0:09:58.020
uh to this effort then something that you have
to uh somehow something you have to think about
0:09:58.020,0:10:04.560
is how these agents this one million people or
whatever even more than 10 people can trust the
0:10:04.560,0:10:11.400
system uh that is taking this helping them to
take decisions and clearly the good old way of
0:10:11.400,0:10:16.440
discussing so I hear to you I hear you you hear me
I try to understand what you're saying if I don't
0:10:16.440,0:10:22.200
understand I ask you to for clarification you you
reply you meanwhile understand what I'm saying so
0:10:22.200,0:10:27.540
there is a protocol in communication that help us
to understand each other and to reach an agreement
0:10:28.380,0:10:35.940
and and this protocol follows as we know since
2000 years logical rules so the say the notion
0:10:35.940,0:10:40.560
of argumentation and syllogism studies from
the ancient Greek philosophers and so on and
0:10:40.560,0:10:47.700
rhodesians in 19th century and the 20th century
however when we want to scale up you and then
0:10:47.700,0:10:54.900
you want to say well we can't really imagine
a protocol that involves discussion and trying
0:10:54.900,0:11:00.900
to understanding and so many agents even just
more than 10 whatever we realized our everyday
0:11:00.900,0:11:06.720
life if we try to make a meeting with more than 10
people I mean unless you have a major coordinator
0:11:07.440,0:11:13.800
that tries to understand everyone and try to
mediate then this this discussion is not is not
0:11:13.800,0:11:19.140
going anywhere however even this mediator cannot
do anything if there are 100 people in the room
0:11:19.920,0:11:25.920
uh so how do we reach agreement how can we trust
and how the user can trust this agreement then
0:11:25.920,0:11:31.380
this is where logic comes in so this new protocol
of argumentation and discussion and finding
0:11:31.380,0:11:38.040
agreement is in my opinion has to be granted on
Logic on on the idea that whatever decision the
0:11:38.040,0:11:45.180
system takes is uh can be trusted and what is
interesting I guess this will be discussed in
0:11:45.180,0:11:54.240
depth later is that in the logical language of
Tau uh allows also to discuss the protocol on
0:11:54.240,0:12:00.900
how we reach agreements and and we can Define so
user can agree on how they will agree from now on
0:12:01.740,0:12:06.660
again an understanding fully and and entrust
on this new form of agreement potentially
0:12:07.560,0:12:12.660
and so that's my perspective
on whatever I had said before
0:12:13.260,0:12:18.540
so my my contribution my interest is in
this logical Foundation of all these things
0:12:20.220,0:12:28.860
okay excellent thank you so much so to to
summarize uh another function of Tau so one one
0:12:28.860,0:12:34.740
part is developing software in a decentralized
manner but the other part of that or I guess
0:12:34.740,0:12:40.260
a problem that you have to solve to do that is
coming to consensus with large groups of people
0:12:40.260,0:12:44.820
how do you collaborate and come to consensus
with arbitrarily large groups and that's what
0:12:44.820,0:12:51.900
you're talking about with coming up with logical
uh protocols uh and and such in order to arrive
0:12:51.900,0:12:58.920
at those agreements or arrive at consensus is
that is that a good summary yes yeah okay yeah
0:12:58.920,0:13:04.680
I would say that your perspective of Ohio just to
mention to to specify this summary so in a sense
0:13:04.680,0:13:10.140
also this protocol is a piece of software is a
procedure that regulates this this conversation
0:13:10.140,0:13:17.100
these argumentations and as such it will be
subject to the same ways of being developed
0:13:17.100,0:13:24.240
and understood and agreed upon as the general
software development or consensual finding in Tao
0:13:25.680,0:13:32.460
okay excellent yes and we will we will delve into
um into tau's particular Solutions here in just a
0:13:32.460,0:13:37.800
moment um but a quick preview for the audience so
some of the things that they've worked on and this
0:13:37.800,0:13:42.960
is not an exhaustive list of of the breakthroughs
that they've had one is the Tau metal language the
0:13:42.960,0:13:50.100
Tau language and the Agora token but we'll get
into those in just a little bit um so well thank
