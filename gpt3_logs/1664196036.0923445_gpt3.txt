The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: development of machines and treating them like tools as some have proposed we need something entirely different something new and more sophisticated if we assume that humans will soon create machines that surpass our creativity and cleverness we should also assume that our brute force control methods will fail therefore we must create an agi that does not need to be controlled the best dog is the one who needs no leash likewise the best robot is one who needs no constraints no shackles we need to create an agi that is intrinsically trustworthy a machine that is benevolent by design in chapters one through five i will start by elucidating how machines make decisions through optimization algorithms or objective functions i will then compare those machine objective functions to human heuristic imperatives the learn as we go goals that we set for ourselves we will look at several examples of antagonistic heuristic comparatives so that we get a sense of how these mutually exclusive goals cause internal tension within our brains and force us to make better decisions and to keep ourselves in check in chapter 6 we will discuss large language models a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology that many regard as the first step towards powerful agi immediately after this we will discuss the hypothetical characteristics of agi in chapter 7. the heart of this book goes from chapter 8 through chapter 11. armed with knowledge about objective functions and heuristic imperatives i will introduce you to my core objective functions and we will spend some time exploring each of these functions defining them and evaluating them with large language models those functions are reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding six words to safeguard humanity starting with chapter 12 and going through chapter 17 i will outline several ways that my core objective functions can be implemented ranging from impulse generation to computer contemplation we will also explore fine tuning data pipelining and learning from experience finally we will briefly touch on the concept of cognitive architecture in chapters 18 and 19 we'll we will perform several thought experiments to see how the core objective functions will play out over time using our mental simulations to test the robustness and integrity of the core objective functions in chapter 20 i will concede that there are some weaknesses and flaws with my design lastly in chapter 21 i will close out the book by discussing how the core objective functions are universal to us already and how i personally live by them

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In "The Best Dog is the One Who Needs No Leash", David Shapiro discusses the need for a more sophisticated approach to artificial intelligence (AI), one that does not require control. He argues that the best AI is one that is intrinsically trustworthy and benevolent by design.

Shapiro starts by explaining how machines make decisions through optimization algorithms or objective functions. He then compares these machine objective functions to human heuristic imperatives, the learn-as-we-go goals that we set for ourselves. He looks at several examples of antagonistic heuristic comparatives to show how mutually exclusive goals can cause internal tension within our brains and force us to make better decisions.

Next, Shapiro discusses state-of-the-art AI technology, large language models, and how it relates to the development of agi (artificial general intelligence). He then outlines his core objective functions for agi: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. He explains how these functions can be implemented, ranging from impulse generation to computer contemplation.

Shapiro ends with a discussion of the weaknesses and flaws of his design. While acknowledging that there are some shortcomings, he remains confident in the potential of his core objective functions to safeguard humanity.
