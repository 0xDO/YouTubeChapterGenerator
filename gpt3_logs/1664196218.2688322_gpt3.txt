CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Cloud NLP platform offers a variety of pre-trained models, including one called "GPT Neo-X." I haven't used it myself yet, but some people on the Discord chat swear by it. They say it performs just as well as the models in OpenAI's GPT3 "instruct" series, but it's open source. I believe it's trained on Alan AI's "instruct" series.

So there you have it. Thanks for watching. This is my second "state of the industry" address, so thanks for watching, and I'll check in with you next time.
