0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:08:44.520,1:08:50.280
this path there are many possibly infinite paths
different different programs that execute your
1:08:50.280,1:08:57.060
desires right your desirada your specification
so you may give preferences you can say well I
1:08:57.060,1:09:03.180
want to have the shortest one or the fastest one
or the cheaper one in terms of fuel they need to
1:09:03.180,1:09:08.640
to use whatever so you have a sort of among all
the possible realization of this specification
1:09:08.640,1:09:12.900
because of course there are many there'll be
there will be reason to prefer some over others
1:09:13.500,1:09:20.040
and and so this is a typical AI problem which in
the naive way is implemented as a search problem
1:09:20.040,1:09:26.460
so you have you want to do things in terms of
a robot I start a certain position I know I
1:09:26.460,1:09:31.380
have to go there first of all I can have some
heuristics I can have some some way to to try
1:09:31.380,1:09:36.480
first so I know if I have to go to to the city
center or to the supermarket and know that it's
1:09:36.480,1:09:42.120
in that direction because you see the tower
and that however well I go in that direction
1:09:42.120,1:09:49.020
but then maybe I hit against the wall okay maybe
this is not really smart so well I backtrack and
1:09:49.020,1:09:53.940
I try to go slightly on the left and then it I
keep going trying to go in that direction so I
1:09:53.940,1:10:00.840
have some driving force which is the heuristics
I search for for diff for the solution my party
1:10:00.840,1:10:04.980
potentially failing and backtracking and
then eventually I find the goal that's how
1:10:04.980,1:10:10.740
Google Maps find the the the the the the your
paths the best one the cheaper one Whatever
1:10:10.740,1:10:18.240
using these kind of principles now what is also
quite special in in the technology employed by
1:10:18.240,1:10:25.260
Tau which is fully an idea of rad is that we
don't rely these arguments on third we don't
1:10:25.260,1:10:29.400
base these algorithms on search but we use them
based on a different kind of technology which
1:10:29.400,1:10:38.520
is Boolean algebras and automata so in this sense
we avoid also hopefully somehow uh in in most of
1:10:38.520,1:10:43.260
the cases the hopefully means that is you cannot
guarantee that the solution will be fined always
1:10:43.260,1:10:49.380
found in always in the fastest possible way
but you can approximate the optimality by by
1:10:49.380,1:10:54.600
minimizing the time that you waste by doing wrong
choices somehow right and then you try to find
1:10:54.600,1:11:01.920
the best program the best implementation of your
specification uh in in a reasonable amount of time
1:11:04.740,1:11:15.300
yes excellent um okay so we have uh well I
guess before I declare this are there any other
1:11:16.560,1:11:23.460
um components or topics before we break into the
the result what is the final result of Tau and how
1:11:23.460,1:11:27.960
are people going to interact with it and you know
okay we have a way you have you have described a
1:11:27.960,1:11:34.680
way to um to develop software in a decentralized
manner with this interpreted language
1:11:35.760,1:11:39.240
um but kind of the question then is
like okay so what what can we do with
1:11:39.240,1:11:45.240
decentralized development of software what is
the what is the long-term outcome of this and
1:11:45.240,1:11:50.520
how is it going to change my life your life
how is it going to change the world foreign
1:11:51.720,1:12:02.160
aspect one thing that happens at the beginning
is everyone just saying what they have to say
1:12:02.940,1:12:08.040
everyone Express their opinion that Mario may
not reflect on how the software should be like
1:12:10.860,1:12:18.840
and as a byproduct you are going to
have the most powerful AI in the world
1:12:19.860,1:12:25.860
controlled by the people that belongs
to the people not belong to one entity
1:12:25.860,1:12:30.360
that who knows what their intentions are
and it will be the most powerful because
1:12:31.860,1:12:40.680
so many people train this AI they just speak like
they speak in social networks I will say that we
1:12:40.680,1:12:48.360
already uploaded our mind to the cyber we just
didn't do it in machine comprehensible languages
1:12:49.020,1:12:54.060
now that you will re-uploid your mind to the
Cyber in a way that machine can understand you
1:12:57.300,1:13:00.600
the consequences of this
are bigger than imagination
1:13:04.740,1:13:08.040
so that's one big deal that is
going to happen from this technology
