The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with a new video okay so i'm kind of upregulated because i'm really excited so if i go too fast i'm sorry y'all have been really excited about automuse 3 um and so the premise of auto muse three in case you haven't seen that video yet um it's down here so the idea was that i was going to set up two simulations there was going to be a scene simulation and a character simulation and a world semi or i guess multiple simulations um that works but i realize that i'm thinking about it all wrong so the whole idea behind simulating a world and characters was um that was that came about as a way to test uh maragi which is my cognitive architecture work um but i realized that this that the simulation approach would work really well for open-ended um like sandbox kinds of kind of worlds which would be really good for like um video games so you can have video game characters that you know have a have a sense of agency and kind of have their own ideas however so that's one direction and also i um i don't know anything about making video games so it's going to take a lot of work to hold a text based simulation together i'm am brainstorming stuff there so i'll come back to it but looking at my most popular videos the stuff that y'all really want is um at least that gets the most views in the most hours watched is writing fiction so what i'm going to do is i'm just i'm going to separate out auto muse from the simulation side and to the fiction writing side so one of the goals gold standards is is writing long form fiction that is something that a lot of people want to do and it is very difficult to do and why is it difficult to do well as i said in a previous video it takes us writers literally years worth of work in order to write long form fiction that is how much cognitive labor goes into writing novels so i real that's when i was thinking like okay i'm not thinking about this right so i started i went i had to go for a walk to kind of get my get the gears turning in my head that's why i'm so upregulated and i actually like almost ran back i walked about a mile or two from home and then i was like wait i got it okay so what i do um is in order to break down these cognitive tasks into large language model tasks is called decomposition and there's a there's a paper out there about decomposing tasks with large language models um but it does still at this time generally benefit from having an expert do this decomposition so i was thinking okay there's two primary methods of writing stories one is the pantser method which is it's flying by the seat of your pants and you just sit down and write and see what comes out you don't worry about uh coherency or anything like that and i realized that that's what i was doing with auto muse was it was basically if you create create a good enough simulation and you just simulate a character you simulate a world and you just fly by the seat of your pants um this actually worked up to a certain point so if you watch this video um uh actually no it wasn't this one what was i working on um the uh it was the the one with the dragons the scene simulation right okay so i created a short story here and i realized um it got stuck on repeat but this is a story and i was like wait hold on i did this this is this is pantsing but then i was like okay got stuck on repeat because the story kind of got to a logical conclusion and then it i realized oh this is the this is the problem once you get a premise once you get like the first you know page or two of a story it takes different cognitive tasks to expand it from there um and so that's when i realized like okay so this scene simulation the simulation method is a type of pantsing where you just say okay i'm just gonna set the scene and push play in my brain and write what comes out that's pantsing to a t 100 pantsing so i was like okay well what happens with pantsing pantsing is you start with a premise and you expand on it and that's as far as i got where um if you look at this one the scene simulation um let's see what was it right novel um so i started with this premise here which is just the opening of a story just sit down and start writing and then you expand on it and so you expand on it and then each of those chunks that you created you expand on those and then finally once you get to enough so it's generation and refinement is the cycle for panting so once you generate enough then you start the process of refinement so refinement is is uh solidifying the characters solidifying the plot lines maybe doing some developmental editing like changing the order of operations that is going to be really dang hard um but i realize that it's it's got to be staged so it's like okay um pantsing is really difficult it's really messy so probably won't do that first which is why i was having such a hard time making progress with the scene simulation and the character simulation method i was just like wow this gets so messy so fast but it's a start so basically i've got to this point where you start with a premise and then you do the first tier of expansion but then it requires a different kind of expansion to expand further where you just sit down and write so we'll get back to that what i do as an author is uh well most authors are somewhere in between um so a pure a pure pantser just sits down and writes and then you get to where you stuck you're stuck and then you start over again it's you know revision hell it's about just drafting drafting drafting um and then i tend to be more on the plotter side which is you start with a premise then you figure out your title your theme your setting your characters and your plot and then you generate an outline and then you generate scenes and so this is much more structured which means it lends itself to coding now obviously this is if it's just recursive expansion and refinement that also lends itself to coding but each of those steps is much messier so we'll come

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Hey everybody, David Shapiro here with a new video.

I'm really excited about automuse 3, and I've been getting a lot of questions about it. So I wanted to give an update on where I'm at with it.

The original idea behind automuse 3 was to set up a scene simulation and a character simulation, as a way to test my cognitive architecture work, maragi. But I realized that this approach wouldn't work well for the kind of open-ended, sandbox-style worlds that are good for video games. So I'm still brainstorming that idea, but in the meantime, I've decided to focus on the writing side of things.

One of the goals for automuse 3 is to write long-form fiction, which is something a lot of people want to do but it's very difficult. As I said in a previous video, it takes writers literally years of work to write a novel. So I need to find a way to break down these cognitive tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.

One method of writing stories is the pantser method, where you just sit down and write and see what comes out, without worrying about coherency. I realized that this is what I was doing with automuse, and it worked up to a certain point. But then I got stuck, because the story reached a logical conclusion and I didn't know how to expand it from there.

That's when I realized that the scene simulation and character simulation methods are a form of pantsing. And pantsing is very difficult and messy, so probably won't do that first. That's why I was having such a hard time making progress with the scene simulation and character simulation methods.

So basically, I've got to this point where you start with a premise and then you do the first tier of expansion. But then it requires a different kind of expansion to expand further. That's where I'm at right now.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. Thanks for watching!
