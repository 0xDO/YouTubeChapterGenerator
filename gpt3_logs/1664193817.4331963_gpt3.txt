this as an input and then this will be the output and this is actually what the what the training data is going to look like so the final step that I haven't done yet I'll pause the video and do it again um or do it and then show you is to let's take these 400 different samples let's just grab another random one hey there co-worker um let's see this one didn't do a full rewrite then that's fine some of them some of them don't need much help um let's see oh here we go to colleagues from yourself upcoming changes at work to inform colleagues of upcoming changes to ensure that everyone is on the same page professional and informative hey everyone as we all know change is inevitable starting next week there will be some changes taking place at work I just want to let everyone know what to

to 5 p.m um yeah so that's fine and uh because we're going to be fine-tuning it on all these different I just noticed the name praise a cow because we're going to be fine-tuning it on all these different kinds of input the final model will actually be more robust and more capable than any of these individual samples and I'll show you what you mean after we're done so I'm going to go ahead and and do the fine tune job and then when we come back I will show you the final product all right the email generator is done so let's give it a try uh scroll down let's see fine tune David Shapiro Dolly email generator there it is so I wrote a couple of scenarios um this one was actually inspired by a Reddit post that was trending um so the story is my cousin Jenny embarrassed my son at her wedding um my son is trans afab and Jenny insisted on calling my son by his dead name because of this we decided to leave early I need to send an email to the family explaining why to my whole family for me my son and my wife we left uh subject why we left Jenny's wedding early intent explain why Jenny's Behavior was hurtful and unacceptable goal have the family understand our perspective and needs and repair damaged relationships tone diplomatic but firm so let's see what it does let's turn up the uh length a little bit 512. um so this was trained on 400 samples and there's four different types here we go um oh I forgot to add stops oh well um darn it that's fine um all right so dear family we are sorry we had to leave Jenny's uh wedding early but we felt that we had no other choice Jenny embarrassed our son by insisting on calling him by his dead name despite our clear communication that was not acceptable we understand that this was a misunderstanding on Jenny's part and that she did not mean to cause any harm however we feel that this behavior is completely unacceptable and there's no excuse for it we understand that it is not your fault and you did not know what was going on however we feel that you should have been made aware of what was going on we hope that you can understand our perspective and that we did what we felt was necessary to protect our son we would appreciate if you could respect our privacy at this time thank you okay that's not so bad um yeah I really regret that I forgot to put in a um a stop but that's okay um someone told me what is it if you do um there we go so we'll do that okay so if there's a double new line um actually that'll probably stop immediately let's try that yeah because it'll just stop there so if we do one new line there we go we were sorry we had to leave okay cool um so the stop could probably just be um if you start with one new line and and go there okay so then there was a second scenario which was a chat so this is a chat let me just show you what it says um user I need a B2B email a vendor trying to get in with a New Prospect okay what are you selling a mail opening service what are the special

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Dear family,

We are sorry that we had to leave Jenny's wedding early. Jenny embarrassed our son by insisting on calling him by his dead name, despite our clear communication that this was not acceptable.

We understand that this was a misunderstanding on Jenny's part and that she did not mean to cause any harm. However, we feel that this behavior is completely unacceptable and there is no excuse for it. We understand that it is not your fault and you did not know what was going on. However, we feel that you should have been made aware of the situation.

We hope that you can understand our perspective and that we did what we felt was necessary to protect our son. We would appreciate if you could respect our privacy at this time.

Thank you,
