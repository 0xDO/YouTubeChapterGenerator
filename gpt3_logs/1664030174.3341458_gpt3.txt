0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:34:52.860,0:35:00.300
and then we'll pass it the request and the outline
and so basically this is this is the easiest way
0:35:00.300,0:35:07.380
to do a recursive thing so we'll do def improve
outline and we're going to have the request and
0:35:07.380,0:35:15.420
the outline passed in and so then we're just going
to use this prompt um so we say prompt equals
0:35:16.080,0:35:26.760
open file prompt improve outline dot text and
so what you're seeing here this is this is the
0:35:26.760,0:35:32.940
um the most basic form of recursive programming
with gpt3 where you feed the same the output
0:35:32.940,0:35:45.300
into the same function several times um so dot
replace request with request and then dot replace
0:35:46.620,0:35:53.880
um outline with outline make sure that I use
the right terminology yes outline is there
0:35:53.880,0:36:02.820
brainstorm some possible improvements okay and
then we'll copy the same outline one dot and
0:36:02.820,0:36:10.320
so the reason that you have to include this is
because the prompt already has that see if you
0:36:10.320,0:36:15.120
don't have that then the first one will not have
its numbered list and that just it just it's bad
0:36:15.120,0:36:24.600
form and it doesn't look good and then we'll do
return outline okay so then we will um here we'll
0:36:28.200,0:36:33.420
actually for debug purposes I'll just
leave all this to do new line new line
0:36:34.200,0:36:37.140
outline and then we'll do
0:36:42.660,0:36:48.360
improved outline okay now
let's test this real quick
0:36:52.740,0:37:01.440
what is Shinto tips for visiting facts okay so
it is it is reliably recreating what we wanted
0:37:02.400,0:37:10.800
and then it converged uh and
then it blew it up curse you okay
0:37:12.660,0:37:18.600
yeah it didn't it it just it randomly
nuked it okay let's have fewer iterations
0:37:19.800,0:37:25.200
because if you do if you if you if you
try your luck it will eventually Break
0:37:26.580,0:37:30.000
um the coolest Tory gates in Japan
different types of Contour Gates
0:37:31.920,0:37:38.640
okay so doing One initial iteration and then
three iterations seems to be good all right so
0:37:38.640,0:37:45.840
we'll leave it at that um cool so actually it can
be kind of fun to leave the uh the debug output so
0:37:45.840,0:37:50.160
I'll probably just leave that there so that when
you're running it you can see what it's doing okay
0:37:50.160,0:37:59.100
now we consult the scriptures we got the good list
brainstorm some facts or points for each one yes
0:38:00.060,0:38:12.660
okay so then section research yes okay so sections
equal outline dot split lines so now the sections
0:38:12.660,0:38:22.020
list we can iterate on this um a few times but
we're actually zeroing in on the final product
0:38:24.060,0:38:24.840
so
0:38:26.940,0:38:35.340
let me think of how to do this because do we want
to write it one section at a time I think we do
0:38:36.120,0:38:40.500
yeah because the way that the way that it
breaks down now is we do the research on
0:38:40.500,0:38:45.660
the section we do the pros on the section and
then we stitch it all together we improve the
0:38:45.660,0:38:52.080
pros and then we have the final product okay
so we'll do final blog equals so we'll do that
