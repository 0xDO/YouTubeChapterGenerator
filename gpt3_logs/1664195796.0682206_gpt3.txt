The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: playing um plenty questions they have asked the following question is this an allowed question it must be in the form of a yes or no uh question so question is um person place or thing and is this a yes or no question whoops why is it okay it doesn't understand um we'll give it a uh yes or no and we'll say false so what I'll do is if you do if you do low temperature and it's something as simple as this if you want very deterministic output you'd set the temperature to zero and give it a few examples um uh let's see so um I need to label um label it so what we can do is just shorten it to just this pattern so that'll save us tokens and it'll also make it faster because it'll do less processing and then you can also just use new line as your stop sequence um so we've got one example of each so far that's probably sufficient right false if it is not a yes or no question right true if it is a yes or no question whoops don't need to say that okay um that is probably sufficient and so then what we'll do is we'll just save this as our um valid question or here prompt valid okay and so then we'll do question here and its output will be what we want okay so first is Val uh no we'll do prompt equals open file uh prompt valid dot text Dot replace um question with question and then is valid equals uh GP gpt3 completion prompt and also do temp equals zero because we don't want any creativity with this um okay so then we'll do uh for this we'll do print is valid and we'll test this real quick whoops all right debug night I have picked my secret word ask your first question um what is the um airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow false okay um is it a thing true cool um is it a bug that's a valid question okay good all right so I think that works all right if is valid I wonder can I cast this as a Boolean oops I wonder if that works um bacon true uh let's see how do earthquakes happen true I think it's only doing true okay I don't think this works yeah let's try that again there we go okay foreign if is valid equals uh actually false because this will be the shorter use case if it is false then we uh we print um that is not a valid question minus one point to Gryffindor um okay so then we say uh um that's fine so and then then it just um it iterates so questions remaining equals questions remaining um minus one and then we do continue so if you're not familiar with python continue basically says okay wherever you're at in a loop just go back to the beginning of the loop um so it skips the rest of of whatever this uh whatever this is and goes from there that's actually probably Superfluous especially if I do um uh else if is valid equals um true then you continue and then the the loop will end here um actually one thing that I can do so this is this is my old school days learning Pascal C and C plus plus often um the the size of the program is constrained especially if you're doing like microcontrollers and so what you'd actually want to do is move this because you're always going to call questions remaining at the at the end right um and so rather than have that line repeated you then you just you um you do something like this so after your else if else statements um then you then you you go um so but the reason you might be wondering okay well why why do else like why not just do if else why do else if because there's an off chance that gpd3 will just spit out something else entirely um so we'll do um uh let's see um answer question um but then we'll do we'll have an else statement that just um print uh sorry um uh the machine is confused try again no points deducted and so we have this we have this like debug case so in this case because there's there's different possibilities um it would be easier um actually here so then we'll do continue here um because we're just skip skip to the end so we'll skip this and then what we need to do we'll say if questions remaining is less than or equal to zero um then uh #game over and we're almost done actually um let's see okay so answer the question ah all right so cat and then we'll come in here and we'll say a user is playing 20 questions that's a good start um they have asked the following question um let's see uh they have asked the following question um uh let's see I have to answer yes or no um uh as to um I have to answer yes or no um so let's see how is this going to look because I also want to do it like a few shot right um because like if the secret word is cat then I want to question like is it a person you'd say no so we'll start with the question um so secret equals cat question equals is it a person answer no yeah that should be a good format okay so then we'll give it a few examples of this so the secret would be um George Washington and then um is it is it involved with communication and the answer will be yes okay so now let's test this and give me one more for testing USA all right secret USA question um um is it a popular place let's see what it says answer and then we'll say um I refuse to answer yes yes and it's a famous place [Music] um is it um let's see is it in the southern hemisphere no okay good it looks like we're getting factual answers um so what we'll do is we'll copy this um and this will be our prompt answer dot text and so then we'll do Secret and we'll do question and then we'll leave that for answer so that's the the new line stop a new line that'll be good okay so um all right prompt equals open file we'll do prompt answer dot text dot replace Secret and this will be with um secret word and then we'll do dot replace um question mind blank for a second there let me bring some more of this coffee and then we'll do answer equals gpt3 completion prompt and so then we'll do print um we'll do answer and we'll do dollar or percent answer okay so the last thing we need to do um before we test the questions we need to say is it right um Okay so user asks a question and then uh check if user is correct and then finally um check if

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The person playing 20 questions has asked the following question: Is it a person? The answer must be in the form of a yes or no question.

The machine is confused. Try again. No points deducted.
