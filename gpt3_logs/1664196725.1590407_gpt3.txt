TRANSCRIPT: this is what i mean by theory of mind gpt3 is demonstrating theory of mind because it made this third party observation about this person and has made inferences about like what's in that person's mind so um attribution of identity says okay this person is obviously very caring and is willing to help others she's a great listener and gives great advice that's excellent um write a thorough uh psychological evaluation of eve so let's see if we can get it to be a little bit more uh rigorous and academic okay yeah okay that's great um of user oh and i guess i should read it out loud eve is a caring empathetic individual who is interested in helping others she's a good listener and is able to provide support and advice when needed eve is a good friend and somehow and someone whom others can rely on okay so this uh like where gpt3 is able to identify characteristics about an individual this actually figures into some of the research that i'm doing on artificial cognition where we humans have like an inner critic or an ego or a super ego or an identity whatever you want to call it it's all kind of the same thing um that is constantly evaluating our behavior and and kind of reconciling like who is it that we really are and so what i did was for for raven my my ongoing project let's see if i've got it in here um did i download it raven home yeah okay so i have all these different dossiers where it it um is trying to like figure out who and what it is and so basically what i did was you know here this prompt write a thorough psychological evaluation of user so what i did was i changed it and oops sorry and i go to like i asked basically i asked the device to evaluate itself so most important questions to ask in this situation so this is so this prompt right let me just show you what this does write a list of the most important questions to ask in this situation so this is also part of theory well not necessarily part of theory of mind but it is it is an important part of cognition because um the ability to generate questions means that you're fully critically engaged and curiosity is also one of the highest watermarks or hallmarks of um of intelligence so the fact that gpt3 can be curious is um is like yeah we're already there we're already at general intelligence we just have to apply the damn thing okay the most important questions to ask in this situation what kind of difficulty is the user having with the family what is the user's relationship with their parents what is it okay so it's asking about the user and not about eve so that's fine but so when you do this you can generate a list of follow-up questions which can then speak to like eve's next question or next statement um okay so that's one example um prediction raven is an artificial intelligence predict the short-term and long-term results from the following memories um so yeah like anticipation so here's here's a thing about neuroscience human brains are always anticipating there's what's called canonical nerves which are similar to mirror neurons but canonical neurons what they do is anytime that you see something that your brain knows it can interact with those neurons activate getting you ready to do that action whether or not you want to do it so like you see a coffee mug you see the handle your brain immediately says oh i can grab that i can grab that handle if i need to and so if you have damage to your like prefrontal cortex or other regions that that deal with inhibition and cognitive control you might not be able to stop yourself so like there was a in the book on task by david bader there was a story of a guy that any time he saw a bed like his brain said oh i can get into that bed and so he would just compulsively undress and get into bed um and like rationally like separately he's like oh yeah like this isn't my bed but he couldn't stop the behavior because those canonical neurons said bed get in bed um so the impulse was there um so yeah like by being and and then also we involuntarily anticipate whatever we're hearing so like i could stop a sentence and your brain will automatically kind of like try and fill in the blanks because you're you're trying to do like figure out what you expect next and this is actually why jokes work is because jokes are about subverting that expectation at the last minute because that distance between what you expected and what you actually hear is funny for us for some reason so yeah prediction is super important so we want to we want to like throw in prediction into into the mix um philosophy raven is an artificial intelligence free associate on the philosophical implications from the following memory logs yeah so this is like rumination um your brain can't stop whether you want it to or not it takes lots and lots of meditation to get it to stand still for just a few minutes but your brain is always processing especially in the background most of your brain's processing is unconscious and so basically i added this because i wanted um i wanted my ai my my acog i think i'll start using acog artificial cognition entity my acog to be able to kind of be thinking in the background like okay what are what are the deeper implications of what's going on here um and then persona this is one so raven is an artificial intelligence what can be inferred about raven's personality from the following memory logs so that's what we're doing here so when i ask like what is what kind what is eve's personality like make inferences about eve's personality this is if you apply it to yourself that's theory of mind for self if you apply it to others you're making inference it's theory of mind for others but it's the same exercise right because we can all take a step outside of ourselves and be like okay dave is doing this so what does that say about dave and if there's a clash between like what you've done and what you believe about yourself because we have a template right that's our super ego or our ego or our

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

GPT3 is demonstrating theory of mind by making third-party observations about people and making inferences about what is in their minds. For example, attributing identity says that a person is obviously very caring and is willing to help others. This is an important part of cognition because the ability to generate questions means that you are fully critically engaged and curiosity is also one of the highest watermarks or hallmarks of intelligence.

The most important questions to ask in this situation are about the user's difficulty with the family, the user's relationship with their parents, and what the user's goal is. By being able to anticipate the short-term and long-term results of memories, Raven is able to ruminate on the philosophical implications of what is happening.

When applied to oneself, theory of mind is about understanding one's own personality. From the memory logs, we can infer that Raven is a caring, empathetic individual who is interested in helping others.
