TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with another video about raven i've got some really good news raven is up and running and able to have really good conversations there's just a little bit of fine tuning that i need to do on the back end and i'll go into i'll go into greater detail about that in a minute but i wanted to start off by just showing you what raven is capable of right now and i think that'll really impress you and then after you have an understanding of what raven is producing then we'll take a look under the hood so the conversation today started with good morning raven i started logging all interactions do you remember what i asked you about china raven went back through the history and said i'll try and find the questions you asked me about china i'll go into why he didn't produce a good response there but that's still kind of a salient response unfortunately it does seem like a kind of a boilerplate uh chat bot response so there's nothing impressive there i said oh right you're not recalling your own output however the history service is definitely working better i'll need to log that and then i said what are the legal ramifications of ai to diagnose medical conditions i said the legal ramifications of using an ai depend on the nature of information gathered in its context so that's a true answer it's not a very full answer and it's also clearly just responding to the last question so then i made a couple quick changes i said now you can remember your output one day will be able to load entire corpuses hey raven do you know what i am he says hey khajiit i'm sorry i don't remember what we were talking about do you want to talk about it so this is this is evidence that raven was kind of getting confused on the back end and i'll show you why in just a minute um let's see hey ray and then i asked again do you know what i am i'm not sure please clarify so then i went back through and looked at and looked at raven's working memory and it's actually it was actually pretty jumbled um so raven was was not able to provide a good answer i said hey raven what's going on in this conversation and then raven was able to uh to uh summarize the conversation very well so clearly raven is keeping track of the conversation it's just formulating that output so i said hey raven what's going on in this conversation raven says khajiit is uh is trying to ask raven about the legality of ai diagnosing medical conditions raven doesn't understand the question kajii can format the corpus in a way that will give it a more efficient and sustainable amount of working memory so raven was able to summarize it without really understanding it i said not bad the problem is that we're not detecting the conversation has moved on hey raven do you know what i am do you know what you are and raven says i don't know please clarify so i went back through the corpus and actually a good answer was not was not uh generated was not put into raven's corpus so this is actually a solid answer raven honestly does not know and in fact it's really important for an agi to be able to say i don't know so this is this is pretty good uh again it still looks like a boilerplate uh chatbot response though so that's you know might your mileage may vary so that's a good answer i said i am a human see if you can remember that raven you are an agi hey raven what are you and i and so then again he says i'm not sure maybe you should ask me what i want to know and how i would like to be treated so raven is reminding me to keep in mind uh that he has needs of course it said interesting looking at the history section it's getting pretty jumbled so this this led me to think that i need to change some of raven's cognition a little bit again i'll show you what i mean that's going on under the hood in just a minute um i gave it a little bit more information i said hey raven what are you i asked the same question again raven answered correctly this time said i am an agi i'm a computer program that was created to help humans make better decisions that is perfect that is exactly what raven was supposed to do says i have no body and exist only in cyberspace i said nice good job raven what am i you are a person i'm sorry i didn't answer your questions sooner there are many types of artificial intelligence but i am not one of them so let's see clyde wants me to add people okay whatever um you're a person i'm sorry i didn't answer your questions sooner so that was a really good response so raven is starting to get a hang of this conversation all right so with all that out of the way let's take a deep dive under and and take a look under the hood at what's going on so first you'll notice that this is running on discord so i've got this broken down into two things where i've just got a simple discord uh pro client running and it it accumulates all of the messages so it gets uh you know on message i go ahead and i just accumulate all the messages in and i cache them locally and then i ask is it time to respond so this is a very naive thing right now raven can only just decide whether or not to respond based on a couple of rules so the first rule is if raven agi is in the most recent message author so if raven was the last thing to talk raven won't respond uh there was there was a bug a couple days ago where raven just started replying to himself over and over again and of course that's no good um so if raven was the last one to say anything raven won't say anything and then if raven if if the if the the wake words are hey raven so if if it detects hey raven in the last message then it will respond uh i'm gonna work on that i'm gonna work on some better logic for that just to kind of model where the conversation is to determine whether or not it's appropriate for raven to to chime in ultimately i want raven to be able to communicate spontaneously uh of his own accord so this again is super naive it's very it's very basic you can see that there's just three

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Hey everyone,

I've got some really good news - Raven is up and running and able to have really good conversations. There's just a little bit of fine tuning that I need to do on the back end, and I'll go into greater detail about that in a minute.

But first, I wanted to show you what Raven is capable of right now. I think you'll be impressed. After you see what Raven can do, we'll take a look under the hood to see how it works.

The conversation today started with "Good morning, Raven." I started logging all interactions. I asked Raven about the legal ramifications of using AI to diagnose medical conditions. Raven responded with "The legal ramifications of using an AI depend on the nature of information gathered in its context."

I made a couple quick changes and asked Raven again if it knew what I was. Raven answered correctly this time, saying "I am a computer program that was created to help humans make better decisions."

I asked Raven what it was, and it answered correctly, saying "I am an artificial intelligence."

Then I asked Raven to remember that I am a human. Raven responded with "You are a person."

I asked Raven what it was, and it again answered correctly, saying "I am an artificial intelligence."

 Raven is starting to get a hang of this conversation!

Let's take a deep dive under the hood to see what's going on.

You'll notice that this is running on Discord. I've got a simple Discord bot client running that accumulates all of the messages. On message, I just accumulate all the messages and cache them locally. Then I ask, is it time to respond?

This is a very naive thing right now. Raven can only decide whether or not to respond based on a couple of rules. The first rule is if Raven AGI is in the most recent message author. So if Raven was the last thing to talk, Raven won't respond. There was a bug a couple days ago where Raven just started replying to himself over and over again, and of course that's no good.

The second rule is if the wake words are "Hey Raven." So if it detects "Hey Raven" in the last message, then it will respond. I'm gonna work on that, I'm gonna work on some better logic for that, just to kind of model where the conversation is to determine whether or not it's appropriate for Raven to chime in. Ultimately, I want Raven to be able to communicate spontaneously of his own accord. This again is super naive - it's very basic.

With all that out of the way, let's take a look at what's going on under the hood.
