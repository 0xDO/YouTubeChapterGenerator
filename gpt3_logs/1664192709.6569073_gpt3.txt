TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with a quick video um i got this fancy new uh camera light let me show you real quick it's uh one of these ring lights um yeah just trying to improve my production quality um so now you can see every detail in my face and like wow under a microscope anyways sorry um this video is going to be really quick i'm just going to talk about uh some of my predictions for the future of ai jobs i have been keeping my finger on the pulse of data science jobs for quite a while i remember about eight plus years ago before like data engineer was a thing they called them like data wranglers and i remember watching an interview with a guy who's like i don't really know what i'm doing there's just a lot of data um and so they were talking about like we're they're just kind of inventing the inventing the job as they went along and now there's you know ml ops there's data engineers there's datatex there's data scientists right and so that is and now you watch on um on like towards data science you see that a lot of these people are getting burned out it's not sustainable the job landscape is changing a lot of those jobs are getting automated away by new platforms and new pieces of software so that's changing quickly and then there's this other trend happening where you get this hybridization where someone comes from a biology background and they learn to use machine learning or data science tools about five years ago or so there was a lot of gatekeeping where a lot of folks on reddit and other places were like uh well you shouldn't even get into data science unless you have a phd in math right there's all kinds of gatekeeping happening that has kind of toned down because uh the free market demands like hey we need people that can do this we don't care about your credentials as long as you can do it as long as you've got the experience and the track record kaggle really took off that was a big game changer because there was a scarcity of phds with it but also just because you have a phd in something doesn't necessarily mean that those skills transfer uh especially to some of these practical um things that like the competitions on kaggle or if you have a phd in math you know where or you have a phd in biology or whatever um yeah most phds that i know are very intelligent and can transfer skills but that being said there is still a dearth of phds and so they needed to the industry the technology industry um needed to bring in people that can do anything so they started recruiting at deep learning groups and kaggle competitions and that sort of thing uh so that has that has been the cha the trade um trend there we go trend that i've seen and then okay so that's kind of where we are today so what do i think is going to happen in the future well large language models such as gbt3 and and um you know megatron and i don't even know what the biggest ones are what was it chinchilla i think was one of the other more recent ones um i have said it before and i'll say it again and that is that computer scientists are not always the best with language um you need someone who understands linguistics in order to make the most of these tools that's why prompt engineering i'm like study you know higher higher humanities major um it's really interesting because my girlfriend has noticed the same thing she's doing her thesis with gpt3 and she showed it to a librarian and librarians get it they're just like this is so cool like ask it this question ask it this question and they rapidly cycle through because they understand language you show it to a philosopher a psychologist they all get it really quick and the way that i kind of describe it to people is that a lot of computer scientists and not all many computer scientists get it but some don't get it because they can't see the forest for the trees or they can't see the language for the math right they're math first folks and so they see the algorithm the code the architecture and they don't really fully understand like what it means to have billions of ideas embedded in a network so my first prediction took me four and a half minutes to get to it my first prediction is that uh is that we're gonna see a huge surge in hiring humanities um majors in in the space of natural language um large language models so you're gonna see english majors you're gonna see philosophers psychologists all kinds of other people getting ai jobs um that is one of my biggest early prediction and and there's a lot of reasons for this but most importantly is just if you've got like a mental model of how to process language like that's a great start um so another prediction is that automation i don't think is going to go the way that a lot of people think it's going to go when some people think of automation and low-hanging fruit they think of like you know automating away burger flippers that's been tried okay you can have fast food robots um the kiosks you know that like at panera bread and wherever else they're popping up everywhere that's low hanging fruit one thing is the automation that you don't see so like lights out factories those are coming so the idea of a lights out factory is you don't have a single human working in a factory floor everything is handled by machines and automation and what you do is you have someone in a control tower somewhere else you know checking on all the robots and they're playing it like a strategy game right like a real-time strategy game where you're collecting resources and finishing missions um and eventually that's going to be automated too um i have worked with a couple of startups that are interested in doing this with lawyers well talk to them i didn't really work with them i just had a couple of zoom calls with them to say like yeah this would work so law in particular is highly susceptible to automation with large language models because law is all text it is 100 text based every court case has transcripts every filing is all

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

David Shapiro discusses his predictions for the future of AI jobs. He believes that there will be a surge in the hiring of humanities majors, as they are better equipped to understand and utilize large language models. Additionally, he predicts that automation will increasingly take over many jobs that are currently done by humans, including law.
