The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: okay so let's go ahead and stop that now what i'm going to do is put in the second one so this second context is the one where we added in recall so this is this imagines that alexander has specific developmental issues that are known and have a particular treatment so we'll submit that and we'll see it's down here context new so this is this is an example of raven's stream of consciousness where raven can keep track of different ideas or different problems different contexts one after the other and you see how it has a unique uuid that allows raven to keep track of different threads of thought so anyways now that we've got this new context let's see what actions are generated so we'll go ahead and hit start go back to nexus um let's see alexander should give his blocks a rest for a while great alexander should take a break from playing with the blocks or he should find new blocks to play with so this is not ideal i do want to add the caveat that i switched to a different gpt3 uh uh engine i switched to curie which is a little bit less creative uh and so still not a bad idea it under like it it still kind of acknowledges like okay he struggles with building blocks so two of these suggestions say maybe he just needs to take a break from the blocks it doesn't pick up on the fact that that the recall service has um has proposed another action right i suppose if if i added in that alexander's mother is available it might have figured that out or if i used a more sophisticated uh neural network but even still these are a little bit more consistent uh you'll notice with the with the longer context it says okay clearly he's got an issue maybe he should take a break i'm still really happy with this although i will say that alexander's parents should give him a hug and tell him they love him is by far the best action i've ever seen this generate okay so let's go back to the context and we'll put in the very last context the one that it talks about childhood anger and abuse so i have i have no idea what this is going to generate but we'll go ahead and submit that we'll see it's down here and so we've got a really long context that has been thoroughly augmented the action service is still running so let's see alexander should be provided with a safe space where he can express his anger without being punished phenomenal that is perfect alexander's parents should learn how to recognize the signs of anger in their child perfect alexander's parents should learn how to respond to their child's anger appropriately perfect so this is phenomenal this is great this is the best possible result i could hope for by adding the context by augmenting the context you can see that that these action generators get better they provide better more salient actions and also once you have better actions and and augmented context that will add both uh historical information as well as encyclopedic information then you will get better results so i can't i'm i'm over the moon right now i think you can tell you know i this is this is great i was having a discussion with an ethics professor and he proposed some some of these kind of caveats and cases and challenged me he's like how are you going to handle all these edge cases how are you excuse me how are you going to handle all these edge cases and i said context augmentation and then i was like why don't i just demonstrate it i don't have to i don't have to prove it theoretically i've got it so here it is and now my next steps are going to be to make sure that the context augmentation happens completely automatically completely programmatically and uh there we go that's it so anyways thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I demonstrated how adding contextual information can improve the performance of an artificial intelligence system. I showed how, by augmenting the context in which a problem is presented to the system, we can get better results. In particular, I showed how adding information about a child's developmental issues can improve the system's ability to generate actions that would help the child. This is a powerful result, as it shows how context augmentation can improve the performance of AI systems in cases where there is limited information.
