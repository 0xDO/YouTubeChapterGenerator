0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:24:33.240,0:24:39.480
um yeah this is this is good so we're getting
we're getting very diverse perspectives and
0:24:39.480,0:24:45.120
so then the last part of this is going to be
feeding these stories into the issue of abortion
0:24:46.860,0:24:51.600
um and then of course I'll make it so that you can
just have any particular thing so I've already got
0:24:51.600,0:24:57.240
the prompt here where it's like here's the story
and then you give it a um then you give it a
0:24:57.240,0:25:03.180
problem um you know so there'll be several phases
to this though because there's there's how I feel
0:25:03.180,0:25:07.680
there's um there's what I want you know what
are what are the things that I'm concerned about
0:25:08.580,0:25:11.280
um that sort of thing so we'll do a
little bit of prompt engineering there
0:25:12.480,0:25:17.340
um actually this is probably almost
done now that's very long wow
0:25:18.660,0:25:25.440
okay uh let's see so let's come in and grab
one of these stories some of them are quite
0:25:25.440,0:25:30.840
long I bet they ran out of tokens because
I have it set to a thousand yeah okay so
0:25:31.500,0:25:38.160
hmm yeah yeah that's too long all right I'll
pause and fix something and I'll be right back
0:25:40.980,0:25:45.780
okay so here's what I did um I had a function
that I was playing around with that would
0:25:46.560,0:25:50.520
keep going until it got really long responses
and it would select the longest response it's
0:25:50.520,0:25:56.100
not necessarily a good thing for any given
output there's an optimal length so what
0:25:56.100,0:26:00.060
I've done is I turn the temperature up high so
that you get more creativity more variability
0:26:00.060,0:26:05.640
but that means sometimes it stops real quick
and sometimes it just keeps rambling so what
0:26:05.640,0:26:11.760
I did is I just did a real quick while true
Loop and so it'll generate stories and if the
0:26:11.760,0:26:16.680
length of the story is greater than a thousand
characters and less than two thousand that's
0:26:16.680,0:26:24.660
kind of The Sweet Spot so then let's see it
might be taking a minute I wonder if it's a
0:26:27.480,0:26:37.800
oh whoops oh wait no it's it should be
generating them so uh looks like no there we go
0:26:41.340,0:26:41.840
yeah
0:26:43.860,0:26:44.760
that should be good
0:26:47.100,0:26:57.240
is it filling up stories there we go so it took a
minute um but again this is this is what happens
0:26:57.240,0:27:01.380
when you have high temperature so I'll go
ahead and pause it and uh we'll be right back
0:27:03.840,0:27:11.400
okay so now we've got 10 stories that are pretty
good um let's see small town in North Africa so
0:27:11.400,0:27:19.440
there seems to be a strong preference for for
North Africa um I can do a little bit of work on
0:27:19.440,0:27:25.980
um on balancing the mix there's also a strong
preference in this batch for Trends so let me
0:27:25.980,0:27:31.380
just show you real quick how I how I generated
those it's not that I am trying to bias the system
0:27:32.700,0:27:39.540
um but let's see we open so there's three sexual
orientations so heterosexual homosexual bisexual
0:27:39.540,0:27:45.960
figure that's good enough to cover the whole
Spectrum um at least throwing a big blanket
0:27:45.960,0:27:50.760
over it and then for um gender expression
there's CIS male female trans male female
0:27:50.760,0:27:55.020
gender queer male female and non-binary male
female that might be too much I don't know
0:27:55.980,0:28:05.700
um but again the the goal is to is to make sure
that every every major group gets representation
0:28:06.660,0:28:11.580
um and that's the point is is it's super easy
you just if you want to do experiments you come
0:28:11.580,0:28:17.700
in and update these trait profiles and then rerun
the generate personas because that's what it does
0:28:17.700,0:28:25.380
it takes education occupation religion that
sort of thing um homeschooling so whatever
0:28:25.380,0:28:32.340
whatever skill level that and so on and so forth
okay so point is we've got a bunch of stories
0:28:34.260,0:28:37.200
um and genetic population um did I forget India
0:28:38.580,0:28:44.700
I totally forgot India that is a
huge genetic population um Indian
0:28:47.340,0:28:52.620
so again I'm not perfect this is just like
figuring it out as I go all right so but
