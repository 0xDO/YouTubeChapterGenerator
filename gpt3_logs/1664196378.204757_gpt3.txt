The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: talking about artificial cognition is the goal is because this is a machine that thinks it thinks about how to solve a problem that you gave it it only does that one thing but it's thinking and so then then the problem is how do you make it think more how do you make it smarter or faster how do you make it able to solve more problems right so this is a natural language cognitive architecture It's A Primitive one but it's darn good and then this guy over here the Amica robot I don't know how much cognitive architecture is in it but they're integrating it with a robotic Opera operating system and so they're working at it and I think that I think that history will record the the deployment of large language models like gpt3 like Bloom like Lambda history will record this as the inflection point where we actually solve that General open purpose uh general purpose open-ended Computing because that's really what it does um with with the with the Advent of large language models we now have um open-ended Computing so what I mean by that is you can have a system that just it'll keep thinking and it's not a finite State machine it's not an infinite State machine where you know it's moving from one mathematical state to another it's completely open-ended in my other experiments um uh get oh there we go um so I I'm reorganizing it so I'm uh I've got I renamed this one um the longitudinal study so this is this was the experiment I did a few days ago where I'm testing core objective functions for their um for different different paradigms for their longitudinal stability um and I showed that Foundation models like Da Vinci tend to be unstable whereas uh fine-tuned models like instruct series tend to be stable but less creative everyone knows that um so I just demonstrated it in a different way anyways so you know what am I trying to say I don't know it's it's just very exciting and I I'm curious to see how all this work comes together on um robotic platforms obviously AGI does not need to exist in a robotic platform that's just going to be the thing that you interact with personally I suspect that um the most powerful things are going to run in data centers in the cloud and you're just going to have a terminal just an endpoint right like you're going to interact with it through your phone through a smart home device but its brain is going to be running up in the data center and I mean that's that's how gpt3 and other large language models run now they're too big to run at home you actually need like several very large computers to run them anyways so that's the state of the industry update is we've got this very exciting time where large language models are being integrated with robotic platforms so we will see where this goes stay tuned it's coming fast thanks for watching like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon have a good one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

We are in the midst of an exciting time in the development of artificial cognition, as large language models are being integrated with robotic platforms. This has the potential to create systems that are able to think and solve problems in ways that are similar to humans.

One of the challenges in this area is how to make these systems smarter or faster, and able to solve more complex problems. This is where cognitive architectures come in. These are systems that are designed to simulate or replicate the workings of the human mind.

One example of a cognitive architecture is the Amica robot, which is being developed with the aim of integrating it with a robotic operating system. This will allow the robot to carry out tasks in a more human-like way.

Another example is the gpt3 language model. This is a system that is designed to be used in data centers, and is capable of handling large amounts of data.

As these systems continue to be developed, it will be interesting to see how they are used in robotic platforms and how they evolve over time.
