TRANSCRIPT: if you've ever done meditation the whole point of well certain types of meditation the whole point of meditation is to detach from your your conscious thoughts and just watch them okay well who's watching the watcher right if our brains have this ability to detach from our thoughts and just watch them then that means we have another perspective inside our own heads that can watch our thoughts that's the point of this so that so that our acog so that raven can become aware of the thoughts and then once you're aware of the thoughts you can also then modify them so this is this is a key step of saying like okay what should i be thinking about right because you can say what should i be doing and that's external but with metacognition you can say what am i thinking about and what should i be thinking about so this this might make it into another layer so i'll comment that one out for now prediction so another thing that our brains automatically do is we try and anticipate what's going to happen next we do that all the time it's completely unconscious and automatic and so we want our acog to be always making predictions because it's like oh this is what i see i'm just going to consciously put this into my nexus where i'm going to this is what i anticipate is going to happen next that can also be good because you can use that as training data in the future because like say for instance um our acog makes a prediction and it comes true that's good that's that's a good sample that's where we performed well if we make a prediction and we're wrong that is an opportunity for error correction um consequences so this is like the opposite of prediction this is looking backwards and this is saying what have been the results right i predicted this five minutes ago did that happen yes or no or did i do good or bad and in a previous test i showed that um if you just give gpt3 a list of log files and ask like hey did did i fulfill my goal here yes or no gpt3 is really good at saying like yes you'd reduce suffering or no you didn't um so that's good the philosophical ruminations this will probably get taken into um into the metacognition loop i'll probably just start calling that because a philosophical rumination is kind of like um you know okay well what are the what are the long-term implications here or what you know what what does it mean like you know if if raven if my acog is thinking like oh i'm a machine right that doesn't necessarily figure into um cognitive control or or decision making but it's important to have right and actually you know the persona this probably actually belongs in the metacognition loop as well something that's happening kind of in the background important questions so spontaneous curiosity this is something that absolutely needs to be in the inner loop and then important information this is going to just be automatically recruiting information from the internet from wikipedia that sort of thing i'm about to make another video about um integrating external sources of information and long-term memory into chat okay so now that you're up to speed because i know it's been a month this is also me reminding myself what we're doing so i think this is probably a good enough start for for the first part of the inner loops okay so going down here we've got our prompt list that's what we were just looking at so these are the prompts that happen every time these are the kinds of thoughts that are happening all the time the entire time that um our artificial cognitive entity is running and so what we do then is we save them out to the nexus so the nexus is going to be here i've just got the genesis um uh memory here which is just this is what i am excuse me sorry a little flammy in the morning um okay let's close these prompts we'll get to writing those later um okay so every time every time we fire up and we we lose we we run these prompts we'll accumulate the most immediate ones in a list and so that's just like okay this list of thoughts is exactly where i am exactly what i'm doing and exactly what i should be doing and i actually realize this is not the right thing so we'll have a cognitive control loop and that's what we're going to be brainstorming now so the control prompts are going to be like um so the first thing you do is okay you've got your task you've got your consequences you've got your predictions so all of these are going to end up as like one chunk right one context um and so we'll say okay so what should i be doing right or or i guess brainstorm the next steps so i think prompt brainstorm because it's like you know oh actually no um yeah okay prompt brainstorm.txt so the what the brainstorm is going to do is it's going to be um so when whenever you're whenever you're trying to do a goal so this this actually came from a discussion on my discord server um we've got a couple people that are really interested in cognitive control and goal tracking and so from those conversations one thing that i realized is that um a key part of of goal tracking and and cognitive control is you actually have to envision what your goal looks like so that's what we're gonna do um so we'll say like um [Music] brainstorming my goals so we'll call it that and then we'll just do um brainstorm okay okay so this is going to be envision what the goal looks like and maybe actually let's call this envision because that's that's going to be i'm going to be happier with that because brainstorming is actually more for procedures um so we'll say envision my goal state um so the the opening example in the book um on task by david bader he's talking about um evidence of paleolithic of a paleolithic human that was napping um flintstones and basically dividing it into multiple piles like these are good arrowheads this is a good axe or this is good for something else and and he talks about how that's actually a non-trivial um set of tasks

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

If you've ever done meditation, you know that the point of some types of meditation is to detach from your conscious thoughts and just watch them. But who's watching the watcher? If our brains have the ability to detach from our thoughts and just observe them, that means we have another perspective inside our own heads that can watch our thoughts. And that's the point of this exercise: to become aware of the thoughts, and once you're aware of the thoughts, you can also modify them.

This is a key step in saying, "Okay, what should I be thinking about right now?" Because you can ask yourself, "What should I be doing?" and that's external, but with metacognition, you can say "What am I thinking about, and what should I be thinking about?" So this might make it into another layer. I'll comment that one out for now.

Prediction is another thing that our brains automatically do. We try to anticipate what's going to happen next all the time, completely unconsciously and automatically. So we want our artificial cognitive entity (ACE) to always be making predictions, because if it can predict what's going to happen next, it can use that information to do things like reduce suffering.

Consequences is the opposite of prediction. It's looking backwards and saying "What have been the results? I predicted this five minutes ago. Did that happen? Yes or no? Or did I do good or bad?" In a previous test, I showed that if you just give GPT3 a list of log files and ask "Did I fulfill my goal here? Yes or no," GPT3 is really good at saying "Yes, you reduced suffering" or "No, you didn't." So that's good.

The philosophical ruminations might actually belong in the metacognition loop as well, something that's happening in the background.

Spontaneous curiosity is something that absolutely needs to be in the inner loop. And important information is going to just be automatically recruiting information from the internet, from Wikipedia, that sort of thing. I'm about to make another video about integrating external sources of information and long-term memory into chat.

Okay, so now that you're up to speed (because I know it's been a month), this is also me reminding myself what we're doing. So I think this is probably a good enough start for the first part of the inner loops.

Going down here, we've got our prompt list. These are the prompts that happen every time. These are the kinds of thoughts that are happening all the time, the entire time that our ACE is running. So what we do then is we save them out to the nexus.

The nexus is going to be here. I've just got the genesis memory here, which is just this is what I am. Excuse me, sorry, a little flamy in the morning.

Okay, let's close these prompts. We'll get to writing those later.

Okay, so every time we fire up and we run these prompts, we'll accumulate the most immediate ones in a list. So that's just like, "Okay, this list of thoughts is exactly where I am, exactly what I'm doing, and exactly what I should be doing." And I actually realize this is not the right thing, so we'll have a cognitive control loop.

And that's what we're going to be brainstorming now. So the control prompts are going to be like "So the first thing you do is okay, you've got your task, you've got your consequences, you've got your predictions. So all of these are going to end up as like one chunk, one context. And so we'll say 'Okay, so what should I be doing right now?' or 'I guess brainstorm the next steps.'"

So I'll prompt brainstorm because it's like, "You know, actually no. Um, yeah, okay." Prompt "brainstorm.txt" so the brainstorm is going to do is it's going to be like "Whenever you're whenever you're trying to do a goal, this actually came from a discussion on my Discord server. We've got a couple people that are really interested in cognitive control and goal tracking. And from those conversations, one thing I realized is that a key part of goal tracking and cognitive control is you actually have to envision what your goal looks like."

So we'll say "Envision my goal state." The opening example in the book "On Task" by David Bader is talking about evidence of a paleolithic human that was napping, flintstones, and dividing it into multiple piles like "These are good arrowheads, this is a good axe, or this is good for something else." And he talks about how that's actually a non-trivial set of tasks because not only are you doing something with your hands, you're also constantly thinking about "What's the next thing I need to do?" and "What are the long-term implications of this?"

So that's why we need to have a prompt that says "Envision my goal state." And then we can say "What are the long-term implications of this?" and "What does it mean?" like "If my ACE is thinking 'Oh, I'm a machine,' that doesn't necessarily figure into cognitive control or decision making, but it's important to have." And actually, the persona probably belongs in the metacognition loop as well, something that's happening in the background.

Important questions are going to be like "Spontaneous curiosity: this is something that absolutely needs to be in the inner loop. And important information is going to just be automatically recruiting information from the internet, from Wikipedia, that sort of thing."

Okay, so now that you're up to speed (because I know it's been a month), this is also me reminding myself what we're doing. So I think this is probably a good enough start for the first part of the inner loops.
