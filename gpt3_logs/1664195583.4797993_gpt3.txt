The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: but does not say how um we could regulate the border without criminalizing immigrants this lack of specificity leaves the reader wondering what exactly the author is advocating for not bad so i pointed out on the uh on the forum that gpt3 was trained a lot of reddit data so it's really good at constructing arguments it's frustratingly good let me run this again just to make sure that it's consistent in its performance let's see it also does not consider are not fleeing difficult circumstances but are instead seeking economic opportunities not bad okay um let's do a thorough assessment let's add thorough back in because i'm wondering if we can get a little bit more we can squeeze a little bit more juice out of this because if it writes one paragraph oh here we go oh much better okay yeah yeah okay all right so this will this will looks like it'll reliably generate two to three paragraphs sometimes one i really like it though so we'll update our prompt whoops where is the prompt go ahead and save this as prompt o2 because this is like kind of the second part of the paragraph oh all right hang on my dog's outside gotta let him in okay i'm back um yes so write a summary write a thorough summary so it all comes down to um right word choice to get the uh to get the desired effect um so the prompto one this will generate our introductory paragraph we remove that verbage from this one where we say what was compelling persuasive troubling and actually so it did a really good job of doing strengths and weaknesses um let's actually separate prompt o2 out into a third prompt and we'll we'll do um so like this this prompto2 is going to be strengths and weaknesses um so let's focus on the compelling persuasive troubling unclear or problematic parts of this one so if we do um thorough assessment of let's see what was compelling persuasive troubling unclear oh whoops crap crap no i'm modifying the wrong one copy that go here whoops okay sorry my brains are a little bit like scrambled eggs this morning apparently prompto3 okay so let's leave let's leave the original prompt as it is but then um here we'll just we'll just copy this and do it all caps so someone asked why do i do caps um and that is because i think i've explained it before but just in case you haven't heard um a caps lock version of a word looks different to gpt3 it uses a different set of tokens um and so gpt3 will see like okay this is like and it looks like a block of instructions or something um okay so let's just change this and let's see if it let's see how much just changing the final kind of thing you know final instruction changes the nature of the output um well that was short maybe maybe maybe my intuition here was wrong okay this is pretty similar all right i think i think my intuition was wrong i don't think pro i think prompt 2 is fine as it is it looks like it got most of it in there um so let's go back to the original um problematic choose phrases like okay word choice is critical introductory okay well i mean let's just let's just start here with prompt one and two and just kind of run it a couple times and see what's missing because my brain is not giving me clear like signals as to like okay what is the next cognitive task that we're missing here okay so i've got this um let's see i don't think we need to do chunks in this one we'll just say text equals open file input.txt so that means we need to have an actual input so we'll do essay to critique and we'll save this as input.txt all right and then result equals list um so what i what i often do when i have like um when i have prompt chaining is i'll do um i'll do a variable called like prompt files equals and then i'll do um you know prompto1.txt and then prompt 02.txt and actually there's an even easier way since i'm following the same format make sure i import os so i'll do um prompt files equals os dot lister do the current directory and then actually put this in a list comprehension so this is a fun thing i 4 i n os lister where no if if prompt in i so what this does so python has this fun thing called list comprehension where you can actually declare and and populate a list in one go and so i for i you would see you would recognize this as instantiating a for loop so it's it's um so the variable name is going to be i and the for loop is for i n os lister so it's going to list all the files in this directory and then it will include it it'll include i so it'll include the file name if prompt is in the file name so this is a fun little one liner that you can do with python so then we'll do for file in prompt files so we'll just iterate through them um and then we'll do prompt equals open file um so we'll actually just replace this with i because i is now the file name and do sa and then we'll replace because we don't have any chunks anymore so then we'll say argument equals gpth3 completion from the prompt so we've populated the prompt and then the result is we're just going to accumulate it all together right and so we'll replace this with argument argument and then once it's done we can get rid of all this we're just going to save the file and we're going to have a double new line between each one and we're going to save it as output.txt so this is pretty compact and so again what this is called is called prompt chaining where it's like sometimes you take the output of a previous one i did this very extensively with like the summarizing and novel writing one but when you're constructing um like especially non-fiction where it's just kind of like one idea after another or one kind of dissection after another it's much much more procedural than especially than fiction um because each passage or paragraph in a in a non-fiction essay particularly if it's an argument where you're skewering one essay each each paragraph can kind of stand on its own okay so let's just run this real quick what is this okay i don't need that um yeah and we'll actually i will leave that in

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The author of the essay does not provide enough specific information about how to regulate the border without criminalizing immigrants, leaving the reader wondering what, exactly, the author is advocating for. Additionally, the essay does not consider that many immigrants are not fleeing difficult circumstances, but instead are seeking economic opportunities.

A thorough assessment of the essay reveals both strengths and weaknesses. The strengths include the author's ability to construct a persuasive argument. However, the weaknesses include the lack of specificity about the author's proposed solution to the problem of immigration.
