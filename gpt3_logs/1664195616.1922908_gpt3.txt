The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: say and so let's change this a little bit um here let's switch to text davinci o2 and i will say whoops um summarize the following discussion um detailed summary that's not really a summary that's just restating it okay that's fine um so given this summary let's copy this real quick so basically what i want to do is let's start modeling the internal monologue of someone um okay so let's go back to um ben but instead we're instead of we're going to bait uh let's say like um we are uh here let's slide we are debating so it's it isn't it is in process um i need to uh brainstorm um my argument the following are my thoughts and responses based upon the conversation so far okay uh summary of the debate so far and so then we'll go grab the summary so we'll say the two participants in this discussion are cletus who believes in creationism and a young earth who believes in evolution each presents evidence for their respective positions with cletus citing the bible and then citing fossils and rocks in the end neither is able to convince each other their position okay so brainstorming how to proceed from here how do i construct a better argument so in an ideal world and i'm writing a book on this how do you get the model to do this on its own um so let's just see what it says we'll switch back to plane davinci because plane davinci is going to be a little bit more creative but it's also more likely to go off the rails as we saw earlier um all right so here we go it looks like it's taking it and running with it great great great great um so he completed the thought our our virtual ben um he said what are my best points i turn to my notes from the debate okay um i could first point out about how that cletus has not addressed my argument that the bible cannot be trusted by stating that he believes in a six thousand year old earth or that the bible is inerrant at beth cletus only argues uh against a 24-hour long day one 24-hour long day one of the creation story interesting i could also say that cletus has not addressed my argument the bible cannot be trusted by stating that the world is not flat nor is it on pillars okay kind of making that up um i could also point out that cletus has not addressed my argument okay so it's basically confabulating that a lot of arguments have happened would that haven't um so none of this has actually happened um let's do let's try this with a better uh a better summary because it seems it seems like gpt3 is just like it's it's confabulating it's imagining um what has happened that hasn't um and also that little bit of like i turned to my notes like there are no notes um these are the notes up here so let's take let's go back over here well first let's copy this because we're on a roll with this uh this bit and let's get a better summary of this write a detailed summary of the following detailed summary and we'll swap back over to davinci o2 that's faster that's a much better summary okay so let's use this as the summary instead so we'll come we'll grab this come back over to here and then we will this back in so instead of this summary we're going to use a better summary summary of the debate so far how do i construct a better argument all right so basically what we're doing here is we're modeling one person's internal thought process right because what we were doing before is we were just modeling um how how gpt3 predicts the discussion would go that's one thing but if we can actually model someone's mind that's even more valuable so that's what we're trying to do here no you don't feel like you have an advantage so let's just there we go and now it's stuck on repeat again this is this is a pretty common problem with um with original davinci as it's like it can be really smart but it can also be really derm come on it fell asleep do a quick time check um we're at 21 minutes all right i'll try and wrap it up in the next few minutes um because i want to get this to work and then i also want to get get cletus's internal thing to work um let's see brainstorming how do i proceed from here um how do i construct a better argument no uh let's see here are uh points i can bring up with um debate i need to be detailed and think through [Music] my points okay it's just repeating itself so this is this is a problem um with using zero shot because i basically i'm trying to give it enough information that it can that it can figure out where what i want it to do um okay it's just making a bunch of scientists are smart that's not a good argument buddy i should be able to i should i should i should okay if i give it an example and i i i don't want to give it an example because then i'm like i'm that's like kind of like cheating but i think i need to give it at least an example and then i can see where it goes from here let's see i could point out radiocarbon dating as evidence that fossils are far older than cletus thinks they are i could point out that humans wrote the bible and and has been modified and re-translated many times so it is unreliable even if it was inspired by god um let's see what else it comes up with okay starts repeating itself again uh let's see i could point out that if evolution were true it is unlikely god or jesus would care about our actions because evolution is a product of what we choose to do or not to do and not a product of god's actions uh i don't even agree with that i could point out the bible is a religious book and not a scientific book okay that's not particularly useful i could point out the bible is full of atrocities and the god is frequently depicted as cruel or at least indifferent to human suffering that's fine that's engaging with him on his point and certainly these are points that folks on the internet would bring up those are not necessarily points that i think a professional scientist would would come up with um although i guess i just said that he was raised by a secular family in new york not that he was a scientist um so these are

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Cletus and a young earth debate each other's positions on creationism and evolution. Cletus cites the bible as evidence, while the young earth cites fossils and rocks. In the end, neither is able to convince the other of their position.

How can I construct a better argument? I turn to my notes from the debate. I could first point out that Cletus has not addressed my argument that the bible cannot be trusted by stating that he believes in a six thousand year old earth or that the bible is inerrant. I could also say that Cletus has not addressed my argument that the world is not flat nor is it on pillars. I could also point out that Cletus has not addressed my argument that humans wrote the bible and it has been modified and re-translated many times, so it is unreliable even if it was inspired by god.

I could point out radiocarbon dating as evidence that fossils are far older than Cletus thinks they are. I could point out that if evolution were true it is unlikely god or jesus would care about our actions because evolution is a product of what we choose to do or not to do and not a product of god's actions. I could also point out that the bible is a religious book and not a scientific book. I could point out the bible is full of atrocities and the god is frequently depicted as cruel or at least indifferent to human suffering.

These are points that folks on the internet would bring up. Those are not necessarily points that I think a professional scientist would come up with. Um, although I guess I just said that he was raised by a secular family in New York, not that he was a scientist.
