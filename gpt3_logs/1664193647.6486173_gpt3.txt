TRANSCRIPT: completely defeat the idea of materialism so what happens during a near-death experience is that you go through a traumatic event most often a car crash because that is something that that is one of the most common traumatic events today um that is life-threatening um but any any any number of things um near-death experiences can happen during surgeries cancer treatments heart attacks all sorts of stuff and because our medical system is better today more people survive things that they would not have survived 100 years ago so there are thousands of reports of near-death experiences every every year now and um this book talks about you know there the common patterns between those near-death experiences there's you know going through the tunnel head towards the light an encounter with some sort of being is is one of the most common mainstays of of a near-death experience but also before that people often have a disembodied feeling where they are looking down at themselves from a third party perspective in other cases they're led by some kind of angelic figure or other entity and they can see things and hear things that are happening away from their body one of the most common things experiences that doctors have is that someone was clinically dead or otherwise you know they were offline and they wake up and they have memories of conversations that happened around them or in in in many cases conversations that happened elsewhere in the hospital entirely so they wake up and they have access to information that cannot be explained by materialism and so what near-death experiences show what they demonstrate is that human consciousness is not always anchored to a physical body sure you look at phantoms in the brain and your the the health the physical health of your brain does have a huge impact on what you know what you think what you can do your perception right um schizophrenia and other problems drastically modify your perception however you look at near-death experiences and there are many many books about this now um plenty of youtube videos there are there there are cases that cannot be explained by materialism um and so you have this one tiny kernel of truth and the implications of that are incredible because if materialism can be defeated right or if it's if it's not always true right socratic reasoning if materialism is not always true then the materialist explanation of the universe is also not always true or not complete i also read dmt the spirit molecule dmt is suspected to to possibly be one of the substances responsible for near-death experiences it's released by what is it the pineal gland and it goes directly into the brain there's a very short path that allows your body to release dmt very fast if needed but dmt experiences are remarkably similar to near-death experiences where you become disembodied um you you think or you communicate with an entity at the speed of thought and even if it only lasts a few minutes or a few seconds you can feel like a lifetime there have been reports of people um going through dmt experiences that it felt like centuries um and so between these between these artificially created experiences and then these accidental experiences it seems like there is mounting evidence and can and consensus that materialism cannot explain all aspects of human consciousness that our consciousness can in some cases be detached from our body um and of course two deeply religious people who believe in souls all along they're like well duh right but i was raised completely irreligious um i have i have never even read a uh a page of religious scripture in my entire life i've never read anything from the bible i've never read anything from the torah or the quran so i'm coming to this from a completely irreligious perspective now one thing that occurs to me is like let's see where did the book go um you know like eugene rose um many people were raised with you know completely saturated and immersed in the judeo-christian tradition which talks about souls like so even before you know i came to these ideas i knew the idea of a soul right like you know all the christians all the all the religious people say that we have some kind of soul some kind of spirit um and so i knew about that idea even without being religious so is it possible that like my interpretation is being colored or coded by um by the the social milieu that i've grown up in absolutely that's that's impossible to separate that out now what i will say though is that other books and studies about near-death experiences and dmt both show that the experiences are very similar regardless of what culture you're in uh so like near-death experiences in japan or singapore or thailand um are very similar to near-death experiences in america and europe as our dmt experiences now the words that people choose to describe their experiences might change based on their culture right but not always so if we pause for a second and say you know because of you know quantum physics says like okay the world isn't the universe is not real we're moving towards it a non-real interpretation where matter and energy are not the be-all end-all of existence and then we look at near-death experiences and dmt experiences that seem to to comport with that and say that consciousness is not always 100 anchored to something that is a physical or material system what then right does that mean that that there is something special about us that we have souls that are reincarnated or something i don't know there are a lot of uh there are a lot of different interpretations this video in particular um by john martin fisher he addresses all this so if you want to engage more with this i recommend this video or the books that i just showed you um let's see get clean up my desk a little because i've got all these okay so that's the background if all if if the direction that i'm moving and the direction that science is moving which is away from

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Near-death experiences (NDEs) have been well-documented for centuries, with reports coming in from all over the world. Though the details may vary depending on culture, there are some common themes that run through many NDEs.

One of the most common features of an NDE is the feeling of being disembodied. This can manifest as either an out-of-body experience, where the person sees themselves from a third-party perspective, or as a journey with a guide (often an angelic figure) in which they see and hear things that are happening away from their physical body.

Another common theme is the encounter with a light or other heavenly being. This is often followed by a review of one's life, in which the person sees themselves from an objective perspective and learns things that they were not previously aware of.

Though NDEs have been traditionally explained away by materialists as being nothing more than hallucinations brought on by a dying brain, there is growing evidence that this is not the case. Many NDEs contain information that could not have been known by the person experiencing them, and they often occur in people who are clinically dead or otherwise not conscious.

This evidence suggests that human consciousness is not always anchored to a physical body, and that materialism cannot explain all aspects of our experience. This has profound implications for our understanding of the universe and our place in it.
