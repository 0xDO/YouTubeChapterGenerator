0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:18:48.000,0:18:49.200
we'll just say user
0:18:51.660,0:18:54.540
and we'll start there or no um
0:18:56.580,0:19:05.880
question there much better so then because
that'll look like this question are you alive
0:19:08.220,0:19:13.500
okay good enough um all right so
question equals input so now we need
0:19:13.500,0:19:17.040
to do some prompt engineering
where we've got a secret word
0:19:19.200,0:19:26.640
um here I'll leave the printing of
the secret word right now um debug
0:19:28.920,0:19:36.060
just so that I can whoops now python 1T question
0:19:43.020,0:19:51.480
s oh I added a that's not supposed to be there
like what did I do wrong Machu Picchu okay
0:19:53.400,0:20:00.120
um good so if I if I at first we
need to test is it a good question
0:20:02.040,0:20:12.420
um so let's just say um uh let's see a user
is playing um plenty questions they have
0:20:12.420,0:20:25.380
asked the following question is this an allowed
question it must be in the form of a yes or no uh
0:20:25.380,0:20:38.760
question so question is um person place
or thing and is this a yes or no question
0:20:41.880,0:20:42.540
whoops
0:20:46.800,0:20:47.880
why is it
0:20:53.160,0:20:54.300
okay it doesn't understand
0:20:56.820,0:21:03.180
um we'll give it a uh yes
or no and we'll say false
0:21:06.960,0:21:10.800
so what I'll do is if you do if
you do low temperature and it's
0:21:10.800,0:21:15.240
something as simple as this if you want
very deterministic output you'd set the
0:21:15.240,0:21:18.180
temperature to zero and give it a few examples um
0:21:20.340,0:21:23.460
uh let's see so um
0:21:27.960,0:21:34.500
I need to label um label it so what we can
do is just shorten it to just this pattern
0:21:35.280,0:21:40.920
so that'll save us tokens and it'll also make
it faster because it'll do less processing
0:21:43.620,0:21:46.500
and then you can also just use
new line as your stop sequence
0:21:53.700,0:22:00.360
um so we've got one example of each
so far that's probably sufficient
0:22:08.340,0:22:18.360
right false if it is not a yes or no question
right true if it is a yes or no question
0:22:20.220,0:22:24.360
whoops don't need to say that okay
um that is probably sufficient
0:22:25.080,0:22:28.080
and so then what we'll do is
we'll just save this as our
0:22:29.280,0:22:40.560
um valid question or here prompt valid
okay and so then we'll do question here
0:22:43.320,0:22:47.160
and its output will be what we want okay so first
0:22:48.960,0:22:58.740
is Val uh no we'll do prompt equals open
file uh prompt valid dot text Dot replace
