0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:35:06.300,1:35:11.520
directive to do something and then the weight is
actually implemented is completely disconnected
1:35:11.520,1:35:16.560
from from what was my specification of what this
Smart Control should be so just this small area
1:35:16.560,1:35:22.800
of application where you have to negotiate an
agreement between the all the parties involved
1:35:22.800,1:35:30.480
in the contract is is a major area of application
to me so I I'm much more for experimenting but
1:35:30.480,1:35:36.900
that's just me right experimenting this small uh
confined areas where you can actually understand
1:35:36.900,1:35:42.780
and focus potentially also on problems and make
some app in particular social problems that have
1:35:42.780,1:35:52.440
to be understood to to to potentially solve the
bottlenecks that may arise etc etc I'm very fond
1:35:52.440,1:35:58.560
of all the technical solution that we have found
that the oadden is genius group is is really
1:35:58.560,1:36:05.340
working hard on this uh that is uh the the open
problem which is not a problem there there is the
1:36:05.340,1:36:09.900
goal to start applying and see these things really
in the real world deployed in the real world
1:36:12.120,1:36:19.080
excellent yeah um Ohad what's what's your dream
short short or long-term dream for for Tau
1:36:22.800,1:36:24.840
the cow is all about truth
1:36:25.920,1:36:34.740
it is for people like me like us who like
the tools who prefer the truth of the false
1:36:37.020,1:36:45.600
um I hope to that I will bring a little bit more
truth to this world to this full of life's world
1:36:47.520,1:36:55.260
excellent excellent okay um so we're
nearing the end of this conversation
1:36:56.520,1:37:00.240
um what are the next steps for for Tau
1:37:01.380,1:37:07.020
um what's what's coming down the pipeline where
are we at and then how do people get involved
1:37:07.020,1:37:11.940
let's talk about let's talk about from this day
forward what's what's happening with Tau and and
1:37:11.940,1:37:16.680
what is what is the level of involvement for
people like me and and people in our audience
1:37:22.320,1:37:28.740
and for your environment we have a community
mainly taking place on telegram we also
1:37:28.740,1:37:34.920
have a monthly update every every month on
YouTube and people can submit their questions
1:37:36.660,1:37:42.960
and for the next steps we are now moving to
a finalize and implement the Tau language
1:37:42.960,1:37:48.840
and in parallel and see how to put
it as a block acceptance condition
1:37:48.840,1:37:54.480
on a blockchain and finally to start
having a cell phone ending blockchain
1:37:56.940,1:38:04.260
and so those are the next steps excellent
excellent um yeah and and so it's it's it's
1:38:04.260,1:38:11.580
coming to fruition it's about to be uh live on the
network um what are the just as a final question
1:38:11.580,1:38:18.000
what are the what are the key problems left to
solve if any um are there any hurdles or Frank
1:38:18.000,1:38:24.600
uh it seems like you have an idea of what are
the major problems left to solve well uh well
1:38:24.600,1:38:29.760
it depends on the meaning of the word problem so
I see interesting challenges to still be sold and
1:38:29.760,1:38:36.900
make time making Tau even more powerful so I
think we have cracked down the main issues the
1:38:36.900,1:38:43.560
main quests by having this language that is able
in a logic fashion to talk about itself to talk
1:38:43.560,1:38:49.860
about laws that to change the laws the dynamic
aspects to model software to be very powerful and
1:38:49.860,1:38:55.920
still being decidable so that we have terminating
correct algorithms there are new things that we
1:38:55.920,1:39:04.260
can add to this language new aspects to add is on
its exclusivity so we mentioned I guess briefly
1:39:04.260,1:39:09.120
that the language if we take the most powerful
language then this would be undecidable so we
1:39:09.120,1:39:17.400
cannot really hope to implement it but we uh
taking the the the decidable fragment is sort
1:39:17.400,1:39:24.180
of arbitrary so we took One Direction and so we
can still hope to to give it more potential and
1:39:24.720,1:39:30.660
and then somehow making more interesting for
several aspects for example to model formally
1:39:30.660,1:39:36.960
the notion of argumentation I know there are some
aspects in this to this sort of game theory that
1:39:36.960,1:39:40.920
will be involved in argumentation could be a
possible extension of the language there are
