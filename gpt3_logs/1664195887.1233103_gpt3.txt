The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with uh part two of my getting started with python and gpt3 from scratch video series uh before we get started please go ahead and like and subscribe this video uh that will help me work towards getting monetized on youtube which who knows maybe one day i'll be able to do this full time but also if you like uh my videos my content you find them helpful please consider hopping over to my patreon link in the description or comments and consider supporting me directly that will go much further towards helping me to do this full-time you see how i churn out content i'm happy to keep doing this and the more support i get the better it'll be so without further ado let's jump back over to our uh our project our learning so this is our repo this is where we left off we did a hello world um a read me and and so on and so forth now what i've done is i added a i added git ignore and what git ignore does is i've added open ai api key because last time i said whatever you do don't ever store your api key publicly or in a git repo and so what git ignore does and this is what it looks like locally is it tells git to ignore that um you can do directories you can do wild cards as well so you could do like star.json to ignore all json files that's fine so but if i look in my repo my key is here so you should have last time you should have created this text file and populated it and get in and get your hello world to work so let's take a quick look at hello world um all this does is opens a file sets the api or at first we declare a function that opens the file reads it and returns um that file contents and then we have a function that will do a davinci completion um and then we will we'll we get we pass it a prompt that says write a list of famous american actors we get the response from gpd3 and then we print it out so i'm assuming you did your homework and you you've tested this so python hello world so it'll take just a second and then it'll spit out tom hanks leonardo dicaprio jennifer lawrence brad pitt excellent so it works now this was all statically coded so what are we going to do we need to do something more useful so what we're going to do is we're going to hop over to the playground and we're going to do some prompt engineering so let's just say we want to do our first chatbot um so we'll say the following is a conversation between user and jacks jax is a sentient sentient machine with the goal of i don't want to say something evil like taking over the world let's say jax is a sentient machine with the goal of um i don't know world peace that's fine um okay so let's say user hey jax uh what are you doing today and then let's see what happens if we just hit enter that says jacks i'm working on my plans for world peace not bad so what's the first thing that you notice um there's a space here uh that's not necessarily a bad thing but we'll we will have to contend with that space um if we uh when we go to automate this in code that's like okay user okay how are you going to achieve that and we say what's next i'm still working out the details but i'm confident i can make a difference user so you're not that smart are you i'm being real sassy here oh okay all right so you can see that this works so now what do we do how do we actually take this into um and and do this with code so let me show you so the first thing we do is we copy down this prompt this initial prompt and you see how how how um how simple it is uh so what we'll do is we'll copy that we'll say we'll save this into a new file do a couple new lines and then we'll do block and i'll show you what we do with the block in just a minute so we'll save this as prompt chat so now we have this which is just a copy paste of what we did in the playground and it's like okay well how do we accumulate these this chat how do we what do we do here i'm glad you asked so we'll get we'll start a new file and then we'll do file f uh alt f a for alt uh file save as and we'll go to all types and we'll say um chat dot pi so now we've got a new um we've got a new uh uh python script that we're working on this will be in the repo so you will have been able to just clone this down but what i recommend that you do is that you ignore the existing file you can look at it for reference but that you follow along and do this coding by hand so first what we'll do is we'll just copy the existing code that we have that works there is no shame in recycling your old code just remember that if you have errors in your old code you're copying those errors i do that all the time um okay so we start here we've got our completion it uses davinci and we say prompt write a list of famous american actors all right so here's your first big python lesson we want to have an open-ended chat so there's a few things that we need to do first we get rid of the prompt not using that [Music] so we'll say while true oops so while true this is what's called a this is what's called a loop there's a few kinds of loops the two primary loops that you'll use are a while loop and so if you do while true it's just always true so this is an infinite loop so while true what are we going to do uh well first we need user input and we'll say user input equals input and we'll just say user oops user and it's that simple so this is a built-in um uh construct a built-in function for python that allows you to just take in console user console input from the user great okay now what ah well we forgot a step what do we where do we put this do we just pass this um do we just do gpt3 completion user input what do you think is going to happen nothing because let's say that you see something that says like that you get this variable here let me just show you actually python um uh user input equals input user it says user um hey jax are you alive okay now what so then we say print user input hey jax are you live so if we just print this or if we just send this up to gpt 3 it's not

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the previous video, we left off with a simple "Hello, World" program that demonstrated how to use the OpenAI GPT-3 API. In this video, we'll extend that program to create a basic chatbot.

We'll start by creating a new file called "chat.py". In this file, we'll start by copying the code from our previous "Hello, World" program. This time, however, we'll remove the prompt and instead use a while loop to continually prompt the user for input.

Next, we'll use the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate responses to the user's input. We'll do this by calling the "completion" function, passing in the user's input as the "prompt" parameter.

Finally, we'll print out the response from the API.

With this basic chatbot program in place, we can now start having conversations with our computer!
