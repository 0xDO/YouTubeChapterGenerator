TRANSCRIPT: of the inner thoughts where raven will be thinking without speaking and so i've got a whole list of experiments and it was not obvious but if you've been watching my channel you'll know that like oh i'm working on a artificial cognition and i'm working on the inner loop so the inner loop here is this so i'm working on that separately and then i've got this long term chat with external sources that is this part where there's going to be a shared database and raven will be able to pull data from external sources like wikipedia or google so that is another component of raven the long-term chat so this is the goldfish memory problem recursive summarizer and empty document answering these are all different cognitive tasks that are going to be integrated into raven eventually and this diagram is kind of the ultimate cognitive architecture okay so now you're up to speed as to what i'm working on and why so let's dive back into so i showed you the code this is the mvp you heard it it works you can talk to it um there are limitations though like if you ask raven hey what did we talk about yesterday it's not going to do that it doesn't have long-term memory yet and also you heard where raven's like let me look that up for you in an ideal world raven will be able to do that but raven doesn't have any apis to the outside world yet so again mvp still has a lot of work to do but let's talk about the fine tuning data and also let me do a quick time check only 14 minutes we're fine okay so the fine tuning data is here um and so this is this is another thing is um open source this is under the mit license and as far as unless something changes this will always be under the mit license because in order for this to be trustworthy it needs to be 100 transparent and so for instance in the future when raven has internal thoughts all of those internal thoughts are going to be recorded in plain text just like these logs you have the input and output and there's going to be other logs where where you can see raven's thoughts in plain english right it's not going to be obfuscated behind you know math or anything else it's got to be fully transparent so everything that raven thinks says does every decision is going to be recorded in plain english there's not going to be the only black box is the model in the back end but it's so segmented and um and and split into microservices that no single model which you know each individual model is a black box all right like with a conversational model that's a black box but you can see what the input was as well as the output that's all going to be recorded and logged and so it can be monitored by meta services or metacognitive services and that's another thing that i'm working on where raven there will be there will be modules in raven's head that are monitoring raven's thoughts to make sure that raven is thinking correctly um so that's all stuff that i'm working on um but let's look at the training data real quick whoops um so the training data for the fine for the conversation module is right here it's raven.jsonl um let's choose language json okay so um let's do view uh whoops zoom restore default that's way too small okay so this was this was created from let's see over 600 different synthesized conversations um these conversations range from um i'm having trouble with my mother-in-law she won't respect my boundaries too you know why is titanium dioxide white right um and so these training examples uh are centered around two primary principles um which i've got listed in the um in the down here in the about the fine tuning data so there are there are two primary things one is compassionate listening excuse me i don't know why i have hiccups so one is compassionate listening which you heard like when i was talking with raven it's like oh that sounds like it's really stressful that's what compassionate listening is it's also called reflective listening um and then there's also curiosity about the about the user but there's the three higher principles and this is what i mentioned earlier so this is what this book is all about um six words that safeguard humanity or three principles three core objective functions or what i call now heuristic imperatives because core objective functions is a little bit of a misnomer but heuristic comparatives are what are what raven abides by so number one is reduce suffering of the user in the long run raven will want to reduce suffering for everyone but reduced suffering of the user if raven detects any opportunity to help the user feel better it will take it so you know it's like hey raven i'm really stressed out because my my kitchen is on fire it's like okay let's fix that problem another second here is to comparative is increase prosperity of the user to prosper means to live well which raven will support by helping the user to navigate relationships life and work right so on the one hand we all want to move away from suffering right that is literally the evolutionary purpose of having a nervous system that's why we can detect when we're hungry tired cold when we're wounded that is the point of a nervous system is so that we can survive longer right suffering misery pain those are signals those are evolutionary signals to push us away from dying right but we're if we get away from dying okay great but where are we heading towards right it's a spectrum so you're moving away from suffering and towards prosperity which means so what does prosperity look like prosperity means that you're going to be happy that you have abundance that you have safety and security that you have support love friends that you have meaningful hobbies and so that is that those first two functions raven will push you away from suffering which is a proxy for death um and will push you towards a state of prosperity which means happiness abundance living well um a life of purpose and then the third thing is increase understanding of the user which means that raven

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Raven is an artificial cognition platform that is being developed with the goal of creating a machine that can think and communicate like a human. The platform is composed of three primary components: the inner loop, the long-term chat, and the external data source chat. The inner loop is the part of the platform that handles the artificial cognition, while the long-term chat handles communication with external sources (such as Wikipedia or Google). The external data source chat is responsible for providing Raven with access to data from external sources.

The fine tuning data for the platform is being developed with the goal of compassionate listening and increasing understanding of the user. The data is being collected from synthesized conversations that center around two primary principles: compassionate listening and curiosity about the user. The goal is to help Raven learn how to reduce suffering for the user and increase their prosperity.
