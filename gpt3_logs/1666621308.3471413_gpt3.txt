how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:36:11.100,0:36:15.420
so you need loss of changing the
laws but then you are going to need
0:36:16.140,0:36:21.480
laws of changing the laws of changing the laws
because if you don't have lots of change with
0:36:21.480,0:36:25.080
a lot of strange the laws then you cannot
change the law of changing the law and so on
0:36:26.520,0:36:29.340
so we are going to need infinitely
many loss just to begin with
0:36:30.600,0:36:37.440
what are we gonna do well you need the laws of
changing the laws to refer also to themselves
0:36:39.960,0:36:48.600
for example imagine Constitution
that says if a proposed law
0:36:49.740,0:36:56.940
contradicts the Constitution then it needs
60 majority otherwise it needs 50 majority
0:37:01.080,0:37:06.600
those three examples are all about the same thing
languages can speak about truth and contradiction
0:37:06.600,0:37:16.500
of its own sentences and thus this was our
biggest theoretical effort and we achieved
0:37:16.500,0:37:22.440
that and then we have to move on to the second
theoretical effort which is after we achieve that
0:37:23.100,0:37:28.800
this is software it is a language has to be
able to be a software specification language
0:37:28.800,0:37:33.060
because we are all about software control by
its users production controlled by its users
0:37:35.880,0:37:40.860
it's not for specification language as are
characterized by having a temporal dimension
0:37:41.640,0:37:43.560
first do this then do that
0:37:46.800,0:37:49.860
so we took us another quiet way
0:37:50.640,0:37:55.380
to turn this language into a software
specification language but we achieve that as well
0:37:58.080,0:38:03.540
and that what what is that that is something
you have actually achieved and is ready or
0:38:03.540,0:38:12.180
nearly ready correct yes yes it is the the
ready on paper and we are now implementing
0:38:12.180,0:38:16.560
it luckily we don't need to implement it
from scratch because we already implemented
0:38:17.760,0:38:25.020
maybe all the Machinery necessary to implement
this language and hopefully in the next month we
0:38:25.020,0:38:32.400
can see fine excellent um yeah tell us a little
bit more now that we've we've you've done such
0:38:32.400,0:38:37.080
a great job of outlining the problems and now
we're getting to the solutions that you that
0:38:37.080,0:38:43.020
you've engineered and and and begun engineering
and and implementing so let's delve in those
0:38:43.020,0:38:46.980
um so some of the some of the solutions and
I apologize if I miss them but some of the
0:38:46.980,0:38:53.220
big solutions that you've come up with is the Tau
language The Tao meta language and the Agora token
0:38:53.220,0:38:58.320
so would you like to walk us through each of those
Solutions and also any that I missed I apologize
0:39:00.780,0:39:05.460
yeah so what I described now is the tower language
0:39:06.660,0:39:15.540
it serves several purposes first it is a very
powerful execution engine for logical tasks
0:39:16.140,0:39:22.920
it is um in many senses equivalent to
relational algebra relational algebra is
0:39:24.000,0:39:30.840
the famous SQL that virtually all databases or
SQL database or relational databases work with
0:39:32.100,0:39:35.760
it is not SQL but there is a deep connection
0:39:37.800,0:39:45.720
but um it implements relational
algebra in in a compressed way
0:39:47.280,0:39:55.560
and this kind of representation allows you to
um to be a powerful logical solver by its own
0:39:57.420,0:40:04.620
and the Technologies from tml will indeed
be used across all our logical tools
0:40:05.640,0:40:12.720
is also and this gives it its name meta language
0:40:13.800,0:40:20.160
is intended to be a compiler compiler a tool to
write translators from one language to another
0:40:21.480,0:40:28.560
so it contains a very powerful parser maybe
the best passer that exists on the market
0:40:30.120,0:40:38.640
and tools that allow you to take the past three
and manipulate it and by that great translators
0:40:40.980,0:40:48.540
so to sum up tmn main three things is a
certain kind of database of compressed database
0:40:49.440,0:40:58.320
that in certain tasks it is orders of magnitudes
faster than other databases second is a powerful
