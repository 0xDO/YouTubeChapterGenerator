The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you also run out of window size because with fine tuning you're limited to 2000 tokens which you'll run out of real fast anyways that was a little bit of a tangent so here's an example of a prompt outline so detailed.novel outline each beat should be a paragraph long I probably actually ought to change this um this prompt to make it a little bit uh better um synopsis generator prompt synopsis uh let's see writing style and then story tone fix those okay and then uh what did I say change the um outline yeah okay so brainstorm an extremely long high detailed plot synopsis yeah and then I'll say um let's let's borrow the same language so brainstorm a long uh a highly detailed um lot outline for this novel um each plot beat should be a paragraph long and instruct often doesn't know that but I found that if you include this it'll usually do at least like two maybe three sentences whereas if you don't include that um it will only be like uh like one sentence long um and so then what I did I did the same thing where I created a way of grading it so like sometimes it'll just spit out like a few plot beats and I'm like no this is garbage give me an actual plot like full and so then here's a much longer one which is like okay this is something we can work with um so that's grade five and then if it has all the plot beats but they're only one sentence long then it's grade three and so what you can do is you can given the same input you can keep generating plot outlines with high temperature until you get one that's grade five um and so then again that's gonna that's still going to be way cheaper than um than fine tuning right now um now one thing that I did find in in another experiment and I probably can go ahead and open source this because it ultimately didn't work so I guess I don't mind sharing it um so let me go ahead and set this the plotter novel writer um this so change visibility make it public so this one you can take a look at um it basically uh it got pretty far but it's still like it just it lost the plot all the time but what I found was that if you switch to original DaVinci original DaVinci is way better at writing fiction because the um the instruct series was not trained to write efficient um so it's usually really garbage at it but because our original Da Vinci is not fine-tuned if you give it a chunk of prose it'll just take that chunk of pros and run with it and so if you explore these I was working on an idea of like basic outlines and advanced outlines and then um you know it's kind of smushing it all together and this is this is a hot mess if you want to take the time to um to dig through it um I've I've unlocked the video where I was explaining this um let's see where is the one I think it was here oh yeah so if you look at this file I'm not going to say it out loud um but look at this uh this was the one that worked the best um and so you see the whole process of it of it trying to go through and then it gets too long but this story was really weird it was it was really dark um but it was it actually like touched in on like I don't know I was reading it as it was being generated I'm like okay I'm really on to something here um but this was like one out of ten worked a little bit and then because so remember I was saying like you kept I kept running out of tokens like even with summarization you cannot get a full-length novel you could probably do a novella like up to maybe 20 000 words with a with a shorter uh plot structure but gp3 cannot do full-length novels yet um I tried and tried and tried to get enough material in this um maybe you could do a little bit better with fine tuning um so that way you you just give it a few data points and I can write but yeah so it's not it's not going to work um anyways yeah so those are the those are the three things that I wanted to um kind of bring you up to speed on so Auto Muse is alive and well I don't believe that this is going to disrupt the market I don't think I'm going to lose any friends over it because really all that I've got working as a synopsis generator and a plot outline generator and that's like that's pretty formulaic um okay I think that's it so thanks for watching um like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon have a good one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I recently created a tool called Auto Muse, which is a AI-powered writing assistant. I've been working on it for a while, and I wanted to give an update on its progress.

Auto Muse has three main features: a synopsis generator, a plot outline generator, and a writing style fixer. I've found that it works best with the original Da Vinci model, as it is not as fine-tuned and can thus produce more creative results.

So far, I've had the most success with the synopsis generator. It is able to produce longer, more detailed outlines than the other two tools. However, it is still not able to produce full-length novels. I think this is something that could be improved with further fine-tuning.

Overall, I'm happy with the progress of Auto Muse. I don't think it will disrupt the writing market, but I think it can be a helpful tool for writers, especially those who are struggling with writer's block.
