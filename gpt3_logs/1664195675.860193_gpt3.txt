The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here for another video about natural language cognitive architecture um today i've got a kind of a special treat for you this is a project that i started working on a while ago but finally got back to it is called a question generator so why would you want to generate questions uh well let me start by just kind of showing you where i started from so i've got 55 000 um contexts and so a context some of this is going to be from the movie database a movie dialogue database some of it is also going to be from reddit all of this data was available on on kaggle there's a couple other sources that i got from but most of it is from kaggle so these are open source data sets and these are just different contexts right okay so i've got context why would you want to ask questions so questions are really important because questions form the basis of pretty much all intelligence and let me explain what i mean by that so intelligence is in part the ability and the desire to understand well in order to understand something you need to ask questions about it now for the most part our questions are unarticulated they're completely internal they're not in words but you still have a sense of curiosity right our brains generate questions even if we don't speak them and so those internal questions is what our sense of curiosity is our desire to understand to un to to take what we know about something and engage with a new situation a new scenario or a new context and ask questions so what i did was i took about 1200 of these different contexts i've got 55 000 to go from and then what i did was i used gpt3 davinci to generate questions and so these questions can then be used for any number of things if you're using this this this model this fine-tuned model for a chat bot just asking questions can be a tremendously valuable um tool right so like let's say you're having a discussion with someone about a project or a personal issue just the ability to for something to ask intelligent questions is super valuable so you could embed you could bake this directly into a chat bot for instance and then you have the ability to to just ask questions and respond so it's the simplest use another thing you can do is use those questions to feed them into a question answering tool which uh qa is something else that i've been working on it's a central uh question answering is a is a major part of of nowka of natural language cognitive architecture so that'll be one of the next things that i focus on is okay now that i can generate questions next i've got to be able to answer questions right anyways so once you once you can ask the question what where do you send that question to you can send it to a qa service you can send it to a chat output you can you can search the internet you can use those questions to just search the internet because things like google with bert built in google has a really good ability to answer questions now one problem that i haven't worked out though is you see these questions without the context they don't make much sense what are the two types of analysis two types of analysis for what so that's one thing that i haven't quite worked out is how to get the questions to actually have some of the context built in so that's a little bit of a problem anyways let's see so let's cover the context covered the questions oh yeah let me just go through some of the files okay so i've got the context stored here i've got the questions stored here oh and all this code is public now by the way um and then i had some some data prep scripts that i wrote to kind of format the context as you see them now they came from different sources let's see here's the raw data that i got so it's all in there i was trying another experiment where i was summarizing things but i'm not as interested in summarization because eh everyone's doing summarization i don't need to reinvent the wheel there uh let's see okay so how did i generate the questions um i wrote a few different prompts and really what i found was that this prompt was the best all i did was i told gbd3 i said write a list of the most important and salient questions an observer would ask about the following passage so this particular prompt was engineered over quite a few iterations the reason that it says that an observer would ask the reason that it has to say that is because without that context um gpt3 would sometimes try and and take part in the conversation like say why are you doing this to me and i'm like no that you're not actually participating in this conversation let's look at this situation from a third party perspective so by by using the word observer i told gpt3 i said okay what are the most important questions an observer would ask about this situation and that generated very consistent um question output so this is this is how i generated the questions so basically all i did was i took those contexts so for instance um that the news article context whoops where did it go i can't click on it because the recorder is behind it um anyways so i asked um the i transposed the text section here with any number of contexts whether it was dialogue news reddit posts so on and so forth um and then i said generate you know spit out some questions and then it spit out some questions and i showed the example right here so this is the output this is an example of the output from from reddit or i'm sorry not reddit from gpt3 i did a little bit of cleanup you notice that there's no numbering or anything there is some inconsistency you see how the first questions they're not capitalized that's okay it's not a big deal um this looks like it was a technical question about virtual machines and linux and authentication so that's that's cool that also shows that that gpt3 has a tremendous amount of knowledge it knows about tech support questions so anyways just by asking the right questions you can get a tremendous amount of value and then what

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro discusses his Question Generator project. This project takes contexts from sources like Reddit and the movie database, and uses them to generate questions.

Questions are important because they form the basis of intelligence. Our brains generate questions even if we don't speak them, and these questions allow us to understand new situations.

The Question Generator can be used to generate questions for chatbots, or to feed into a question answering tool. One problem that hasn't been solved yet is how to get the questions to include some context, so that they make more sense.

Overall, the Question Generator is a valuable tool that can be used to generate questions for a variety of purposes.
