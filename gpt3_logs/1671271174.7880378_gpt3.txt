0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:28:53.220,0:28:58.860
um oops I should not have closed that um
so we've got uh so we've got stories we've
0:28:58.860,0:29:06.120
got 10 stories so now let's let's um automate
the uh the the the part of where we're trying
0:29:06.120,0:29:14.460
to get issues so we're going to get um so
we'll do a topic responses we'll just call
0:29:14.460,0:29:17.880
it topics and I'll go ahead and pause
it again because this will just take a
0:29:17.880,0:29:22.080
little bit of scripting to Plug and Play a
um a prompt and you don't need to see that
0:29:23.340,0:29:28.620
okay we're just about ready so let me grab
this prompt and I'll just show you what it does
0:29:29.940,0:29:33.420
um all right so this prompt is I'm confronted
with a question or issue and I must write how I
0:29:33.420,0:29:38.280
feel about it I'll write a long extensive opinion
about this topic so then we come and grab a story
0:29:38.280,0:29:43.680
so we'll grab a random story we're in a small town
in the middle of nowhere I stumbled upon a book
0:29:43.680,0:29:55.140
about trans Okay so again same curious person and
then we'll get the the topic which I am going to
0:29:55.140,0:30:02.820
do the abortion one because this is a hot issue
especially in well many places um okay so then
0:30:02.820,0:30:07.320
we have we still have the high temperature
detailed essay on how I feel about this
0:30:10.500,0:30:19.320
um so this you'll frequently get like I'm
opposed to this bill um yeah okay so that's fine
0:30:20.340,0:30:24.900
um but so that we have we have an opinion we
have a feeling but we need a little bit more
0:30:24.900,0:30:30.600
we also need like what are the specific concerns
because part of consensus is you have to surface
0:30:30.600,0:30:36.840
all of the actual objective issues right like
what are what are the key things what are the
0:30:36.840,0:30:42.900
the the the detailed concerns and and it often
has to come out as a conversation um I don't
0:30:42.900,0:30:48.120
know if I'm going to get to conversation this
time because we're already at 30 minutes or so
0:30:48.840,0:30:55.380
um but at least I want to get this far um and then
try and decompose each position a little bit more
0:30:56.520,0:31:01.440
um okay so I like this but let's see instead
of feelings because emotions are critical
0:31:01.980,0:31:07.860
um people's emotional disposition is a part
of consensus but now we have to be objective I
0:31:07.860,0:31:15.600
confronted with a question or issue and I must
write um write about uh let's see right out my
0:31:15.600,0:31:30.300
specific objective concrete concerns um what are
the material uh consequences um or issues involved
0:31:30.840,0:31:37.680
okay so now we're going to change the prompt
pretty dramatically detailed essay on um my
0:31:37.680,0:31:43.380
concrete concerns okay so now let's see how this
changes we're leaving everything else the same
0:31:49.740,0:32:00.960
okay Force many women into poverty um yeah okay
cool so we can have this prompt that just says
0:32:00.960,0:32:04.980
okay what's what are the what are the objective
concerns here so let's go ahead and save this out
0:32:07.440,0:32:08.220
and we'll do
0:32:10.860,0:32:11.580
profile
0:32:15.420,0:32:20.340
I did not mean to cover to
delete that I do profile
0:32:22.200,0:32:29.700
and topic and so theoretically with a little bit
of fine-tuning and prompt engineering because so
0:32:29.700,0:32:37.860
fine-tuning um what I what how I would approach
this is um I'd get real stories from real people
0:32:37.860,0:32:43.440
and their opinions um you'd probably need in
order to get you'd need a lot of diversity in the
0:32:43.440,0:32:50.820
fine-tuning data but you get enough stories about
real people and their takes on these issues and
0:32:50.820,0:32:55.440
then you get the model will generalize and be able
to realize like okay we need to take someone's
0:32:55.440,0:33:04.440
life story into account when when um doing this
okay so we'll say topic um let's see uh concrete
0:33:05.520,0:33:16.560
okay there we go and then finally um the
so part is part is a brainstorming right
0:33:17.280,0:33:23.400
um a big part of consensus is there's how you
feel about it there are your objective concerns
0:33:24.000,0:33:28.680
um but then there's also the creative part the
the the Reaching Forward and and what's called
0:33:28.680,0:33:36.960
bridging which is like okay what are the places
that we can find Common Ground um so here we say
