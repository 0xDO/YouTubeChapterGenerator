TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here um let's see so earlier um i was well here let me just remind you so auto muse auto muse project is about um generating fiction automatically uh so yesterday or day before whenever it was we were generating um scenes so i generated a whole bunch of scenes um almost 700 samples of synthetic data and then we generated follow-up scenes so that's all up here on github let me zoom in a little bit so you can see it better um let me show you what the final product is so the final product is here's the here's the training data so the prompt is it's just a random scene and then the dmarc token is next paragraph and then a follow-up scene so oh and then there's a then there's a stop token right here and that's on all of them so you got the dmarc and stop token so that's the fine tuning data that we've got um so now let me just show you what it does so i asked gpt3 to write a tokenesque high fantasy and i've got it copied right here so what we'll do is um the trees stood like sentinels their leaves wrestling in the wind et cetera et cetera um okay so we'll what we'll do is we'll find slash space plus and replace that which is random space or a single space yep okay it was also said that wizards lived in the forest hiding from the world in their towers the main character a young boy named john so generic um let's change this to something a little more spicy we'll replace john with um stylus sure um my silas had always been fascinated by the stories of the forest he had often dreamed of visiting the forest and now finally he was going to get his chance silas his parents had been killed by a dragon oh that's exciting and had been taken in by the wizard gandalf we can't use gandalf no we'll replace gandalf with uh uh let's see well let's see uh hi zacks there we go it's a good wizard name kaizax told silas that he was special that he had the potential to be a great wizard and so on this night silas was getting out into the forest on a quest to find the dragons and wizards that lived there he was not afraid for he knew that he was the chosen one destined to save the world from the evil that was coming okay obviously it's a little over the top this is not exactly how it would work but so we'll say next paragraph let me just show you this is what it will do so let's grab the fine tune model i also have a character sim one um but it's not done fine fine-tuning it i think that uh i think that open ai is getting uh hammered because they're just they're way more popular than they used to be and so it takes a long time to get fine-tuning jobs done um let's see where is it email let's see this is the scene sim there it is scene sim okay so i've got the end here so it'll it'll just keep generating until it gets to the end um so let's go there we go there we go excellent um it stopped a little early so let's up that to a thousand tokens there's no time the woman said silas run okay cool the dragon is after you so it jumps right into the story that's fine but you can see where just uh because i fine-tuned it to have the pattern where it just it's going to continue generating a story it's ready to go so what am i going to do with this so think about links in a chain that's how we're that's how that's how i tried to do the novel writing last time but one it was a little overly complicated and two it um i didn't have enough training data so this is very similar to my my my novel writing effort there we go okay so what we're gonna do is i'll do view code um so it'll just shows like okay here's the model here's the prompt etc etc that's all fine so we'll copy that and what we're gonna do is we're gonna come to a new um scene simulation so then we're just going to do let's see uh right i don't want to say write novel but it's just we're just going to keep going like um yeah heck with it just it's after lunch my brain is off right novel dot pi okay so we will take a look at the generate scene so i'll copy some of the let's say i don't think i need uuid for this or i will need time and sleep and re okay let me just copy this open file save file yep okay i'm going to zoom out a little bit i had it zoomed way way way in all right so what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing we are going to grab so this is the ordinary completion function um so i'll have this here but then i'm also going to have um def um gpt3 fine tune um so then we'll do we'll keep this mostly the same actually here this is where i can copy this guy yeah model prompt etc etc etc yes that's all good whoops oh right okay so we will do the same so it'll be well here i'll just copy copy this no okay prompt so instead of engine we need to swap this out with model okay so i get this question a lot if you are following along and you cannot use my model this is in my account so you will have to go through and train this data yourself and that is in fine tune.pi so basically what you do is i'll have this commented but so you'll need to upload the scenes.jsonl file and fine tune your own model and then you can use the fine tune dot list in order to to look at your model or once it's trained up you can do what i did here which is you get it in your drop down and then you do view code and this is how you grab your model sorry i forget to say that often but it's very important you can't use my models open ai doesn't allow you to share fine tuned models there are very important safety reasons for that because if you don't know what's in the data you don't know how it's going to handle that right like i could fine-tune a model that is nice and benign and friendly and then but on certain things it just fails so there are really critical safety reasons why not to share models okay so with that then we replace this guy and we go from there okay and then the stop is just end ta-da that's good uh temperature we'll change that back down to 0.7 top p is one token's a thousand frequency presence all that is correct okay so this will

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Auto Muse project is about generating fiction automatically. Yesterday, I generated a bunch of scenes - almost 700 samples of synthetic data. I then generated follow-up scenes, which are all up on GitHub.

The final product is a training dataset consisting of prompts and follow-up scenes, with a dmarc token and a stop token at the end of each. I asked GPT3 to write a tokenesque high fantasy, and it produced the following:

The trees stood like sentinels, their leaves wrestling in the wind. It was also said that wizards lived in the forest, hiding from the world in their towers. The main character, a young boy named John, was fascinated by the stories of the Forest and often dreamed of visiting it. On this night, John was finally getting his chance. His parents had been killed by a dragon, and he had been taken in by the wizard Gandalf. Kaizax told John that he was special and had the potential to be a great wizard. Armed with this knowledge, John set out into the Forest on a quest to find the dragons and wizards that lived there. He was not afraid, for he knew that he was the chosen one destined to save the world from the evil that was coming.

Obviously, this story is a little over the top and not exactly how it would work in real life. However, it does show the potential of the Auto Muse project. With more fine-tuning, it could be used to generate realistic, believable stories.
