The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: in just a second genre location period and then and then modifier and so then we'll do that and then we'll do newline new line and then we'll do lot outline and then we'll add a little space and so basically what this will look like let me show you what the what the actual final prompt will look like um so instead of this it will have location period modifier and then double new line um plot outline and so it'll be like you know sci-fi or i guess i had it out as um science fiction location will be india period will be um the renaissance um and then the modifier will be like cerebral and what did i say like spooky or whatever um uh cerebral and suspenseful okay okay so given just these little bit of information um like if i just if i just put this into gpt3 right now it's it'll probably work a little bit oh i've misspelled suspenseful where did did i misspell that here i was just here okay i don't think i misspelled it up here um suspenseful yeah correct okay um it'll probably figure out what i want to do okay yeah so because it's fine-tuned um it can figure it out um it's not the best uh it certainly is just a plot premise it's not as complete as what was generated before but also this is with text davinci o2 which is already fine-tuned to follow instructions uh another thing that you can do is once you generate data and we'll get into this let me do a quick time check actually um okay eight minutes we've got just a few minutes left um you can also go in and augment stuff so one thing that i like to do is um go to the edit model which is free right now at least it was and you can say like make this more detailed so let's um whoops that's not what i meant to do ah darn it got rid of what i what i wrote okay anyways point being i'll show you i'll show you the edit endpoint and this will be in an advanced uh tutorial as well anyways let's go back to our work um okay so we've got the completion so this is going to be the actual plot synopsis and then the out prompt is this and i showed you what this is going to look like here oh yeah here let me just go ahead and show you so we'll give it we'll get a plot outline an alternate history in india oh now this is fun um so apparently india invents ai during the renaissance that's kind of cool actually all right so here's here's a here's a food for thought later on you can use the edit endpoint and so we'll say let's see expand this plot outline to include more detail um make it a complete story and we'll turn the temperature all the way up because higher temperature generally leads to more creativity it can also lead to some random stuff that you don't want but anyways so another thing that you can do in in preparing your data is you can use the edit endpoint to further augment the data so by baking in multiple steps you can then have a data set that is trained to do more stuff oh here we go so this is a much longer plot synopsis so this is perfect i'm not going to do this this time but just i wanted to show you that this is a thing you can do you can use the edit endpoint to further augment your training data so this is great um let's see delighted in the stories acetics transmutation i think it actually did like an entirely different story okay um i don't know that it actually uh yeah okay the like i said if you have the really high temperature you can get stuff that you really don't do not expect um all right moving on we'll come back to uh augmenting techniques in a later video okay so here we are this is what we want the the prompt to look like so this is what we're going to record and then the output will just be the completion um and so then what we do is we'll do save file and actually let's do a file name real quick file name equals time plus dot text actually no file name will be will be uh let's see i need to remove the ands from it so we'll do what's the shortest one so we'll do place um place period genre okay yeah place plus period plus genre plus modifier um and then we will because each one of these is going to be unique it's only going to touch it once so then we'll do replace space with nothing and then we'll also do replace the and sign because i don't think i don't think it'll save that as a file and then we'll add dot text and then we'll do save file so the content of the file will be um wait make sure i file path is first okay so f uh so we're going to save the prompt out to prompt and then we'll do uh percent file name and then we'll do out prompt and then we'll do save file so basically what i'm doing is i'm saving the prompt and completion with the same file name but to different folders so then we'll do completions dollar s or a percent s percent file name and then completion um and there you have it that should be it um so what i like to do is for a quick debug because you obviously before you spend a lot of tokens you want to make sure it works right um so i i print out the prompt here but then let's also um just so we can watch while it's going here we'll do we'll just copy this so we'll do print out prompt and then print completion because why not you know if you're bored and you're watching your data run why not just do it okay so let's do cls to clear the screen um oops you have to wrap the text in actual quotations okay so we'll let it generate one and then we'll see what happens so this is a romance and comedy set in france during the renaissance this should be fun oh i forgot to do a thing um yeah i bet i bet this i bet it didn't look right so this is why you check your work so during the renaissance in france two lovers pierre and maria must overcome tremendous obstacles to be together their families rival noble our rival noble houses oh this is fun um war is brewing this sounds like war on the fondane um undaunted pier and murray made in secret planning to elope betrayed by one of murray's maidservants oh this is fun jealous older brother henry in a fierce battle they
