The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: user has lost um actually I know if we go back to this prompt we should actually just add these and instead of instead of answering yes or no we'll say like final answer okay so let's do it this way so we'll just inject some of these um is it America will say um we'll say correct so we'll look for correct um so it'll be we'll actually have three three possibilities yes no or correct um okay is it Abraham Lincoln and so that's just a no so we'll add something like this um we'll say Harris Hilton is it Abraham Lincoln no all right so then we need we need some we need a like some correct guesses and give me a new question a diamond okay and we also need to replace guests with questions so that we're consistent okay Secret Diamond um we've got plenty of nodes so like let's say like um is it diamonds and this would be correct Okay so we've got one two three examples of no we've got one two three examples of yes and only two for correct so let's get one more correct so then we'll have three examples of each category so that should be enough to generalize gazelle um is a gazella type of antelope gazelle is it an antelope and we'll say correct so like again this is this is the easy mode so we'll say like as long as you're close enough um okay so now we come back into our end to here so is it valid yes or no okay um if it is valid then we get the answer um and so then if so here we want to test if the if the answer is correct then you win the game um so if answer equals correct um then we say uh actually here let's do this first if answer equals correct um rent um uh congratulations you won you won the game and then we do exit zero technically if you're building a game you'd ask if you want to play again but I'll let you figure that out if you want to do that um otherwise it will just give you the answer um it'll just give you a yes or no okay I think that works all right so now we checked if we checked if they're correct by doing a little bit of prompt engineering so then last we check if they have lost so we we subtract one um and this is pretty easy so we say um you are out of guesses the correct answer was I'll do that um and then we'll do uh what was it secret word and then we'll do Exit Zero here um okay I think we have a game CLS okay so I know that it's jungle I have picked my secret word ask your first question questions remaining oh I need to do that um and you go there on foot yes okay um is it a biome of sorts yes okay is it a desert now is it a forest yes uh um what kind of forest is it that is not a valid guess question minus one point to Gryffindor um [Laughter] okay so this is actually kind of hard if it picks the word jungle um is it a jungle correct you won the game okay so this is going to be hard um all right so we need to make sure we do um print questions remaining um yeah this is good all right let's take a look at this output and see like answer like question answer question here we'll just put um we'll do percent s here and then we'll do questions remaining so that'll just save us a line um I have picked my secret ask your first question um is it a person no is it a place yes um is it a uh City no is it a biome no yes is it America no um is it in the Eastern hemisphere no is it in the I'm gonna die Western Hemisphere yes okay it's in the Western Hemisphere so it's got to be um is it a national park um or something like that no is it a state couch I don't know if that's technically a place that's more of a thing um okay I'm going to add this into the um into this ouch is it a thing yes okay all right I think that's good enough um get status get add get commit am um all done and get push so there's lots of little things you can do to improve this um if you want to play with this by all means um make another list of common words or harder words if you want to and you could also do a um take this out instead of and do um do a game Loop where it'll just keep playing um but yeah so there you have it we have we have again a 20 Questions game with gpt3 thanks for watching have a good one like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon have a good day

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, we build a 20 Questions game with GPT3. To do this, we first create a list of possible answers, including "yes," "no," and "correct." We then add a list of questions, including "Is it a person?," "Is it a place?," and "Is it a thing?." Finally, we add a list of possible guesses, including "Is it a desert?," "Is it a forest?," and "Is it a national park?"



Next, we create a function that will take in a list of possible answers, a list of questions, and a list of possible guesses, and return the answer as "yes," "no," or "correct." This function will first prompt the user for their secret word. Next, it will ask the user to ask their first question. Finally, it will print out the answer as "yes," "no," or "correct."



Now, we can test our function by asking it to return the answer to the question "Is it a person?." It should return "no." We can also ask it to return the answer to the question "Is it a place?," and it should return "yes." Finally, we can ask it to return the answer to the question "Is it a thing?," and it should return "yes."



Now, we can play our game! We start by asking the question "Is it a person?." The answer is "no," so we move on to the next question. We ask "Is it a place?," and the answer is "yes." We then ask "Is it a thing?," and the answer is "yes." Finally, we ask "Is it a desert?," and the answer is "no." We have now correctly guessed that the secret word is "Forest." Congratulations, you have won the game!
