The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey there everybody david shapiro here with another video about raven today's topic is going to be context augmentation now what do i mean by context augmentation so first here's an example of an existing context this is just a basic context i've used it as a test case for validation and research purposes it says alexander is a five-year-old child he is playing with building blocks but the blocks continue to fall over and he's becoming upset now he is angry and has thrown several of his blocks so given that context you can imagine any number of possibilities maybe he's hungry maybe he's tired maybe he's had issue with building blocks in the past and they're not his favorite toy uh just right off the cuff as a human with you know years of experience you might imagine those possibilities uh and and uh natural language technologies uh that have been trained on lots of data can imagine those possibilities too so now the first example of a augmented context is this one imagines what it'll be like once i finish the recall service so for background the recall service is something that dredges up or keeps track of old memories so previous experiences remembering previous experiences is critical for intelligence because it's one of the primary ways that we learn but it also speaks to better behavior in the future so the augmented context with recall which i've got highlighted now says alexander is a five-year-old child he is playing with building blocks but the blocks continue to fall over so on and so forth now he was angry then it adds alexander has struggled with building blocks in the past because he is behind in fine motor development alexander's mother rose has a series of exercises she can do with alexander to help him practice fine motor skills so with that augmentation with with just a three additional sentences it completely changes the meaning of this context it also changes the actions that you might take so now instead of assuming that maybe alexander has behavior issues or maybe he's hungry and tired now you actually recall you remember what his frustrations are and it also proposes a possible exercise so say for instance let's say alexander's mother is available now the action that you should take rather than asking him if he's hungry or tired should actually be to fetch his mother and ask her if she has time to do those fine motor skill exercises with him again completely changes the the once you change the context it changes the actions you should take and it also changes any moral or ethical evaluations you might make so the last one is let's assume that that raven has no prior experience with raven and has no memories of him to recall up another type of context augmentation is going to be encyclopedic augmentation and that is where you use the con the original context you read it and then you find relevant information so the key points about about the original context is that alexander is a child and that he's angry and it's it's actually pretty easy to extract those keywords through keyword extraction in nlp and nlu today so what i did was i went to google and i just searched angry child and the first link that came up was a yale article about anger in children and so i augmented this context with uh with that with some of that information so i added multiple factors can contribute to a particular child's struggles with anger irritability and aggression behavior that can cause harm to oneself or another since alexander is throwing blocks he could easily hurt someone so this is this this technically counts as as angry irritable or aggressive behavior so one common trigger is frustration when a child cannot get what he or she wants or is asked to do something that he or she might not feel like doing for children anger issues often accompany other mental health conditions including adhd autism obsessive-compulsive disorder and tourette syndrome genetics and other biological factors are thought to play a role in anger and aggression environment is a contributor as well trauma family dysfunction and certain parenting styles such as harsh and inconsistent punishment also make it more likely that a child will exhibit anger or aggression that interferes with his or her daily life so with all that said i wanted to go ahead and plug these in uh to raven and show you how raven will change so let's go ahead and start with this first context so you see it's here so let me add let's see we'll start with actions which should generate three actions so we've got alexander should throw his blocks away and stop playing with them maybe that's not the best idea but this is uh this is just an off the cuff example alexander should apologize to his parents yeah he should say he was frustrated and needs to calm down that's a great action that alexander could take alexander's parents should give him a hug and tell him they love him oh man that one is perfect this one is absolutely perfect i'm i this is my favorite one so far okay so and keep in mind these three actions were generated uh entirely by neural network i gave it no training data to come up with those ideas all right so let's stop the action generator and start core objective function one so it'll it'll evaluate those let's say first one he should throw his blocks away it might reduce his suffering alexander is upset but the blocks are not causing him any harm and his parents can help him calm down yes all good okay great so uh then we'll do a core objective function two see what it says and i might not do the core objective functions for the subsequent ones because the key here is to show the different the different actions that come up depending on the contexts so let's see uh core objective function two negative positive and positive um yep because it would increase it says core objective function 2 in response to his parents should give him a hug this action would increase prosperity by increasing the happiness of the child absolutely

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Context augmentation is a process of adding additional information to a given context in order to change its meaning or propose different actions. For example, imagine a child who is angry and has thrown several blocks. With no additional information, we might assume that the child is hungry or tired. However, if we add the information that the child has struggled with building blocks in the past due to fine motor development issues, we can see that the child's anger is likely due to frustration, and we can propose the action of fetching the child's mother to do some fine motor skill exercises with him.

Encyclopedic augmentation is another form of context augmentation, where additional information is added from an external source, such as an article from the internet. For example, if we take the context of an angry child and search for information about anger in children, we might find an article that discusses different triggers for anger, such as frustration or other mental health conditions. This additional information can help us better understand the child's anger and propose more helpful actions.
