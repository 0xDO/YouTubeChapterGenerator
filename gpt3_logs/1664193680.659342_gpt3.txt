TRANSCRIPT: effeminate well i guess link is effeminate um okay so did not get soriyama that's fine um salvador dali so put in another artist um i did uh if you ask for something that's similar to what an artist might have produced it tends to do pretty well um but if you if you try and like say like do something that's completely off the wall that this artist never would have touched it kind of guesses and the fact that i'm saying like oh there we go this worked really well look at that okay so you see like the the exaggerated legs um and the art style okay so it did it worked pretty well with dolly um the archer is way over here um yeah these almost look like tarot cards this is great okay so that worked pretty well um m.c escher i'm going to skip escher you get the idea about artists so then let's do um company logo let's do a minimalist company logo and i might need to take out the sunny forest bit so like just i can imagine like whatever the company is maybe it's like a fantasy studio and you just want a simple elven archer um as your uh as your logo but let's see oh look at that perfect yeah dolly can't spell it's one of the funny things is like um archer [Laughter] yeah that worked pretty well it gave me gave me a nice clean logo i love it um yeah some of these are pretty good um and then fractal art fractal art is a really so there's a few subreddits um one's called like r slash fractal porn and then there's fractal gifts which are just super trippy but yeah so i just wanted to show you that like elven archer in a sunny forest depending on the tag that you give it you can get completely different results and i think i'll call it here just so that you can you can see there's not a whole lot fractal here although it is very colorful i like it it's pretty get a little bit of a motion blur on this one again i'm not surprised that it's that it's kind of struggling this one this is getting pretty trippy it's struggling because anything where it says like elven archer right you're gonna you're gonna have specific expectations um so you do like um i guess i'll do one more um [Music] rainbow clouds fractal art um so if you give it if if basically what what happens is it's going to be biased towards certain styles um it depending on what the subject matter is so like if you do like photo of a woman they're all going to be kind of like more like portraits right there we go um here we got the fractals um so this doesn't even look like clouds to me but it's pretty pretty darn cool so you see like this is clearly like rainbow cloudy fractal um you know fractal artwork so that worked really well but this last one because it said elven archer in the sunny forest it's like i don't really know how to do that yeah you can imagine how you might want it to look but sometimes the style tags are just not going to work anyways i think this is good for now i hope this was a helpful initial tutorial about how to get different styles out of dolly thanks for watching and stay tuned for later

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I demonstrate how you can use the "style" feature in the AI art program "Dolly" to generate different results depending on the subject matter. For example, if you ask for something that's similar to what an artist might have produced, it tends to do pretty well. But if you try and do something that's completely off the wall, it might not work as well. I also show how the program is biased towards certain styles depending on the subject matter. For example, if you do a fractal art piece with the subject of "rainbow clouds," it's more likely to turn out well than if you ask for an elven archer in a sunny forest. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more tips!
