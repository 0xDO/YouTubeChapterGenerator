The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: this and so then you just go up a level you delete the folder um and try it again ignore above Cuda RT dll error if you do not have a GPU set up on your machine so depending on how long this takes it might be worthwhile to um to get uh to get it installed with um tensorflow GPU um if if it is too slow um I'll probably pause the video and do that um yep AVX and avx2 hey I just did a video yesterday about Hardware level support um no such oh whoops I need to create the um data folder man so scatterbrained logs why did I oh yeah because this was my this was my first um demo so I'll leave that there okay third time's a charm so what it's doing right now is it's loading um everything up dialogue one text okay so that should have created this folder so we've got embedding and then the string Bianca did you change your hair Chastity no Bianca you might want to think about it okay so that was uh Cornell uh that was a movie dialogue um and so then here is a 512 vector or Dimension Vector detailing what is in that so one advantage I looked it up because if you look at a table of Bert embeddings they have limited window sizes Universal sentence encoder does not you can have an arbitrary length of of um of embeddings or of characters or tokens because the universal sentence encoder will just keep reading it until it gets to the end and then it will spit out whatever its internal representation of now the longer it is the more diluted it gets so that means like the longer it is the more likely all the all the values are to be like probably like 0.5 or something or maybe just zero because it looks like this this Vector is from negative one to positive one so if you have like if you haven't read all of the internet the vector will probably just be zero zero zero zero all the way down okay so I'm going to pause it again and I'm gonna get um I'm gonna get uh tensorflow GPU uh setup I'll probably do that in Anaconda um and then we'll come back if you want a video of showing how to set up tensorflow Hub with GPU I can do that separately just let me know in the comments all right pausing now let's get this figured out so that it's faster and then I'll be right back actually you know what heck with it I'll just show you what I'm doing um okay so if you open Anaconda Navigator um it's the desktop GUI you go to environments I do everything in bass just because like what I do is so simple now if you have a lot of different experiments that need a bunch of different um environments you definitely want to use different um uh different different um what's it's a VNV so if you ever see VN v e and V it's a virtual environment it's a python virtual environment which means it is a self-contained python environment um but since what I do is so simple I can usually get away with doing it all in bass this did not used to be the case especially a couple years ago you needed all kinds of very very specific versions of everything um I'm wondering why it's taking so long oh do I need to connect um anyways I also spotted that I need tensorflow Hub in this one uh so anyways um so we're basically what we're doing is I just search for tensorflow and I'll put tensorflow GPU and tensorflow hub in and I'll let it basically that what this does is it looks at your environment and it looks at what you're trying to deploy and it figures out all the dependencies for you this is easier to do today than it used to be especially with getting all the correct Cuda packages in place much much easier than it used to be when I picked up the book for Karis deep learning with python by um Francois Chalet the sholay I don't know if I'm saying it right anyways that was back in like 2017 or 2018 it was a pain in the neck to get tensorflow set up tensorflow GPU set up on Windows um but it's much easier today anyways I'll let this finish solving and I'll I'll resume the video once this is done doing its calculations in the background um so anyways be right back okay I think I figured out the condo thing um I installed it as the um like for all users and so I needed to run well first I probably needed to run the um conda Navigator Anaconda Navigator as admin but I did The Prompt as admin um and so then uh what I'll do is I'll just try and install it directly via command line because the uh oh and I did conda update um that's what I just did here let me make this a little bit bigger so you can see it properties font uh 28 there we go okay so then we'll just do conda install Dash C Anaconda tensorflow GPU hopefully this will work so it's running as admin and conda has been updated fingers crossed um and if it doesn't work I'll pause the video again and just figure it out um because I'm sure you're probably bored of this by now but it's running as admin so come on now oh and it's been updated so solving environment all right I'll pause this like you don't need to watch the spin so I'll just pause it and show you the results okay I figured it out it's installing now you look down here uh first I had to update con Anaconda Navigator so I did you know update all that stuff so I'm on Navigator 2.3 and it's running in admin mode so it can install in the environment directly so it's installing now oh my God sorry I'll go ahead and pause it and this will be done in just a second oh and while that's finishing though I'll just show you that um I am doing a little test so we can do a side-by-side test and look at the average time per file so I'm just accumulating here's the start times dot append so I'm just timing how long it takes to do some to do each each file and so then we can do a side by side of um of how long it takes to do it actually I'll do a overall time as well uh yeah I'll do that so do do because this is stress testing right this is performance testing all right moment of truth it's all done um I got the I got the tensorflow GPU environment set up oh and so if you're not familiar with Anaconda to run a particular one you just click the play button

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

This video shows how to set up a TensorFlow GPU environment using Anaconda. First, open Anaconda Navigator and search for "tensorflow GPU". Next, let it install all the dependencies. Once it is finished, open the Anaconda Prompt as an administrator and type "conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu". Finally, run a test to see how long it takes to process a file.
