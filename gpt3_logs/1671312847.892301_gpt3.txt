0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:00:04.260,0:00:08.580
hey everybody David Shapiro
here uh back after a Hiatus
0:00:09.480,0:00:12.780
um I've got a lot going on you'll
be excited for some news coming up
0:00:13.740,0:00:20.760
um first I want to address um a big elephant in
the room I just put most of my videos back online
0:00:21.720,0:00:25.260
um this comes after of course making a
recent video explaining why I took them down
0:00:26.340,0:00:31.680
um I did leave some of my videos down some
of my code down but most of them are back up
0:00:31.680,0:00:37.680
uh both videos and repositories So after
talking with people I figured out like
0:00:37.680,0:00:43.440
striking the balance between creating tools
that will help people rather than replace
0:00:43.440,0:00:50.220
people it's inevitable that things are going
to change but you know a tool is a tool right
0:00:50.220,0:00:55.680
and it's anyways I don't need to get lost in
it go watch the other video so now that I'm
0:00:55.680,0:01:01.200
back um it's time to get my get our hands dirty
again so one of the questions that pops up a lot
0:01:01.740,0:01:09.720
is people want to train gpt3 on how do I how do I
do how do I fine-tune a question answering bot so
0:01:09.720,0:01:14.760
that I can talk about I think someone asked about
like the the case law in Argentina or something
0:01:15.480,0:01:20.700
um I don't have that data but the short answer
is you don't fine tuning doesn't work that way
0:01:21.600,0:01:27.180
um so fine-tuning is about teaching it
a structure you do not teach it with uh
0:01:27.180,0:01:32.820
you don't teach it new knowledge with fine
tuning what you do is you teach it patterns
0:01:32.820,0:01:39.840
so chat GPT is a pattern so the pattern is I
ask a question and it writes a response like
0:01:39.840,0:01:45.180
that you and then you ask a follow-up question
and it writes another wall of text that's the
0:01:45.180,0:01:51.060
pattern Chad gbt was not taught anything new
it's only taught new stuff when you retrain
0:01:51.060,0:01:57.600
the underlying model you can't do that it's way
too expensive to retrain the underlying model so
0:01:59.640,0:02:06.180
I figured let's pick something that will be a good
Exemplar of this so just to do a quick recap the
0:02:06.180,0:02:14.820
the Genesis of this whole this whole project was
that people ask for um how do you fine-tune um a
0:02:14.820,0:02:20.940
question answering thing that will you know do
case law or any kind of knowledge base right
0:02:21.720,0:02:27.000
um it's all the same behind under the hood right
you have a collection of documents wherever they
0:02:27.000,0:02:33.540
happen to be how do I do QA against that with
gpt3 so here we go I already have one one that was
0:02:33.540,0:02:37.560
um answering complex questions from multiple
documents but this is a little bit different
0:02:38.580,0:02:43.320
um because there's there's going to be a few steps
to this so anyways to show you what I mean I went
0:02:43.320,0:02:49.920
over to chatgpt and um I said what is the kind of
law system where law is established by precedent
0:02:49.920,0:02:55.500
and it says this is the common law system and
they this is opposed to civil law so common law
0:02:55.500,0:03:01.020
means that a Supreme Court decision kind of sets
the law of the land so if you want to understand
0:03:01.020,0:03:09.180
the American legal system you really need to
understand case law and more often than not it
0:03:09.180,0:03:13.800
comes down to Supreme Court decisions because that
is the highest court in the land so they set the
0:03:13.800,0:03:21.780
tone for everything so Supreme Court decisions
really teach you how it works so um I went over
0:03:21.780,0:03:28.980
to a Library of Congress and I found that uh
you can download uh all Supreme Court opinions
0:03:28.980,0:03:36.360
and they're grouped by uh by by case topic they're
also grouped by um volume or justice but by topic
0:03:36.360,0:03:40.560
that's going to be more relevant right because
let's imagine that you're an Anti-Trust lawyer
0:03:40.560,0:03:45.900
and you're an Anti-Trust lawyer and you want
to say give me everything about antitrust law
0:03:45.900,0:03:54.240
I need to know everything that there is about you
know um about this so that I understand the legal
0:03:54.240,0:04:00.120
precedent right because on the one hand there's
established procedures right there's procedural
0:04:00.120,0:04:05.040
things um oh and I know all this because my
fiance's cousin is training to be a lawyer and
0:04:05.040,0:04:08.400
um when they come visit uh this is
what we talk about because we're nerds
