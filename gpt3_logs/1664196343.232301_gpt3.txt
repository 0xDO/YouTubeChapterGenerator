The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: suspect that um there will there that will end up with some like you know like nafta-esque like North America Free Trade Agreement things that we'll talk about um protecting artists and their IP and stuff but this is going to be the first I think that this is going to be the first major disruption um my fiance was talking to someone um who was a talent or no no no this was a job that she worked years ago um she worked for an indie press and the one of the founders of the Indy press had been a talent scout for uh graphic artists um I think it was in New York or some some you know some big metropolitan area anyways had been a talent scout and and an agent for artists back in the 90s 80s or 90s but then with the rise of the internet and Photoshop and stuff just those two things you know Photoshop and and and and internet it completely destroyed the need for um Talent uh talent scouts and agents because then they could just post their portfolios on the internet and so like what we're seeing is something similar where um all the AI art is gonna like you know all my thumbnails I do that with with Dolly right um I don't need an AI artist and it takes me in just a few seconds to do a thumbnail now so what happens with these new technologies is things get accelerated but it also um so it makes my my life faster and easier and cheaper but then it also means that I'm not like you know scouring the internet for for art um or you know doing something manually that takes longer um so and that's that's the nature of capitalism right it capitalism always seeks efficiencies so what happens to the you know hundreds of thousands or millions or however many graphic artists there are across the world who suddenly um can be out competed by a machine and even if the quality of the first generation is not that good this like Dolly stable diffusion mid-journey um all of these things are so good on their first for just you know version one what happens a year from now when not only are they faster and cheaper but they are better and more creative than all humans can be so we're looking at like millions of people out of work um and that is that is that's kind of scary and I think that this will ultimately be a wake-up call to people about how powerful AI is is can be for disruption um and then so what what's going to happen next is you're going to have pipelines right there's going to be and some folks are already working on this um oh I wish I had brought up a link I'll post it in the in the comments but basically there's a pipeline where you get a generation and then you have you feed it through something else to like upscale it or fix the faces and that's that's what human graphic artists do right like you do a rough sketch and then you refine it and then you refine it again and refine it again um and so but that's like such a straightforward Pipeline and all that's being worked on um and you know I wrote a post on LinkedIn a couple weeks ago about how even as a novelist um you know granted that's that's not my career that's just what I do for fun um I wasn't worried about AI kind of replacing novels uh or or you know disrupting that because I still have my own story to tell however um in a couple years once we figure out how to generate long format fiction um we're going to see an explosion we're going to see you know there are millions of books published every year right now soon it's going to be billions of books published every year um just as just as AI art is already generating millions and millions of new images per day so another thing that's going to happen is you're going to get this feedback loop someone on Twitter a few days ago kind of made this this quip that's like what happens when the AI models are all trained on AI generated data it's coming um you know with the Advent of language models uh they're all trained on data that was generated mostly by humans with a few like scripts and Bots here and there but over time especially when you look at like all the synthetic data experiments I do in the future all the language models are going to be trained on AI generated language so we're entering into a very new time in terms of data um and and art and I I would not have predicted you know I did not predict um that art was going to be the first major disruption but I think we're seeing the beginning of it now um so that's that that is my state of the industry update um yeah it's it's we're in for we're in for some serious change and that's that's about all I can say for certain um I I have I have accurately predicted some things and I have missed others so I'm I'm just going to leave it at that anyways thanks for watching um like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon um to keep the content coming have a good one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a major disruption in the field of graphic design. With the advent of Photoshop and other software tools, it is now easier than ever for anyone to create professional-looking images. As a result, the need for talent scouts and agents has diminished, as artists can simply post their portfolios online.

This trend is likely to continue, as AI-generated art becomes more sophisticated. Already, there are many examples of AI-created images that are of comparable quality to those created by human designers. In the future, AI will only become more skilled at creating art, to the point where it will eventually surpass human ability.

This poses a serious problem for the millions of people around the world who make their living as graphic artists. With AI able to do their job better and cheaper, many will be out of work. This is just one example of how AI is causing major disruptions across a variety of industries.
