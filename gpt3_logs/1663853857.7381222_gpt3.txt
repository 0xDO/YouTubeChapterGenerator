how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

prosperity and increase understanding so basically
what i'm proposing is that for agi or ace we give
0:10:23.200,0:10:28.640
it a set of principles that it uses to police
itself right because that is what impulse control
0:10:28.640,0:10:34.240
is it's saying i'm going to make sure that i stick
to um that i don't do anything bad right like the
0:10:34.240,0:10:38.480
guy that i told you about that he he couldn't
stop from like cursing out his wife or whatever
0:10:39.040,0:10:45.840
um you know if if uh the so i actually have a
good experiment from earlier in my artificial
0:10:47.600,0:10:53.680
cognition research where um i called it prompt
contamination where i was chatting with my early
0:10:53.680,0:10:59.920
agi experiment and it thought that i was
upset and then it believed it was upset and
0:10:59.920,0:11:05.920
it started becoming abusive and i'm like wait
no you're fine like uh so it couldn't discern
0:11:05.920,0:11:10.800
the difference between myself and itself and i
wasn't even upset i was just asking a question
0:11:11.360,0:11:14.960
um i guess maybe it could have inferred that
i was frustrated because i was asking the same
0:11:14.960,0:11:22.000
question again and again um but anyways
um so like separating self separating
0:11:22.000,0:11:25.600
itself from myself that's another that's a
whole other problem like identity that's the
0:11:25.600,0:11:30.480
default mode network stuff actually let me
add that this is just uh this video is just
0:11:31.600,0:11:37.040
going default mode network we'll talk about
that next um anyways so cognitive control um
0:11:37.040,0:11:45.920
oh where was i um i lost that train of thought um
higher order cognitive processes and inhibition
0:11:46.880,0:11:53.600
i'll get back to it okay sorry this is like i said
this is 3 3 20 in the morning me i need to sort
0:11:53.600,0:11:59.120
through this because it's really important like
i get this signal in my head saying hey hey hey
0:11:59.120,0:12:02.800
like you know you're playing a video game and
you get like a nagging mission objective it's
0:12:02.800,0:12:10.240
like you should do this you should do this that's
what's happening in my brain right now um okay so
0:12:10.240,0:12:13.680
i'm kind of saying the same stuff over and over
again so i'll just move on i think you get the
