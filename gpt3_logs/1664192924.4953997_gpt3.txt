CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was based on several historical precedents. Firstly, they looked at the precedent set by Roe itself, which was incorrectly decided and based on an erroneous historical narrative. Secondly, they looked at the precedent set by Casey, which revised the textual basis for the abortion right and silently abandoned Roe's historical narrative. Finally, they looked at the precedent set by Janus and Ramos, which held that states cannot protect fetal life prior to viability. All of these factors led the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.
