TRANSCRIPT: species and manage that ship as it spreads across the cosmos which that's like the seat the panspermia or seed ship theory right like maybe life was planted here on earth by something else a billion years ago but that still begs the question where did it come from and why um so okay so there we go we've got that um now uh rory uh and i apologize if i butcher your name it looks irish rory o'connor do you have any thoughts as to the similarity between some psychedelic and meditative states and the videos that are popping up from stable d and dolly does this tell us anything about either great question okay so for a little bit of background if you look up um videos about like dmt experiences or psychedelic experiences there's some great hilarious videos on reddit and youtube and people will try and recreate mystical spiritual and psychedelic experiences this is the reason for all the psychedelic art in the 60s is people had these deeply profound meaningful experiences that they tried to recreate um and and so they you know they do it in sculpture and painting whatever and so now that people have excuse me um now that people have oh here let me just get some water one second now with with uh with um digital art um ai art it's really easy to kind of recreate some of those visualizations so one thing that i noticed very early on and you can um it's it's called deep dream so deep dream was like the first attempt at ai image generation and it's very trippy it is super trippy um it just google it real quick i'll put it in chat um google deep dream um so basically what happens is the way that your optic nerve works is that it starts doing things like edge detection and contrast um hey man got another message maybe someone else trying to join okay no just a buddy of mine um okay anyways so starting from your optic nerve like literally um neural vision starts on the retina optic nerve optical chiasm whereas um that's where the uh your your optic nerves cross so that way you can get bilateral connection and then it all gets projected to your occipital to the back of your head where more processing happens so your optic nerve is not just a wire your optic nerve is actually a deep neural network that begins processing so then what happens when you do things like psychedelics or have disorders or hypoxia or whatever any kind of impaired state that that modifies the behavior of of those receptors it'll modify how you perceive the world and you know in cases like alcohol it it um it subdues it um meaning that it's it's slower um but then there's other things that like accelerate it or modify it and so psychedelics are um very similar to serotonin which is one of the primary neurotransmitters in your head and so what happens with with these is that your the way that your brain represents you're basically saying psychedelic simply decalibrate your model of the world partially we'll get to that um i've watched a lot of videos about what psychedelics do and i also read a book um i recommend you read dmt the spirit molecule very cool um so what happens is the way that your brain represents so remember i said that intelligence is patterns what happens in your optic nerve and your visual processing is that your brain and and this is exactly how it works in in neural networks too in artificial neural networks is that your brain creates more and more abstract representations and those abstract representations are then reassembled based on like square here or you know pattern here and so like if you hold out your hand right you can tell i have four fingers but it's a pattern so what happens is your your your brain or between your optic nerve brain everything else you see okay there's a repeating pattern here and so if you're really high on psychedelic you you you look at a pattern like this and it you can't make sense of it right and it's because your brain sees a pattern but it is incoherent and you can't tell how many fingers you have or something like that and that's why you see um lots of repeating patterns in psychedelic art um and it's because your brain can no longer make sense of it because it's like oh i see a pattern and a pattern and a pattern and then all those patterns just kind of clash and then become like prismatic or whatever so that is um but in the early days of ai art or ai generated images they did the same thing but they were trained on um you know images and image recognition but what would happen is you'd end up with like smaller parts of an image that were like you know like part of your shirt might look like a dog and then you'd have like a lobster over here and then something else over here and it's because that model was trying to identify those patterns and it was misidentifying those patterns and it's very similar to what happens on psychedelics um so well i'm probably i'm i know that i'm oversimplifying but yes that is the link between psychedelics and ai art now now that we have models let's see first i yes they were fractals and so fractals are just patterns right it's a mathematical pattern and so that's why ai art and psychedelic art both feature a lot of fractals because a fractal is a good way to approximate a very very complex pattern and that's why you see all kinds of fractals in nature because you can have a very simple like genetic program that just says like you know like cauliflower and broccoli and flowers they all follow um like uh fractal patterns or fibonacci sequences and it's because those are very they're actually they're patterns they're mathematical mathematically determined patterns um okay so there's that um who are academics working on bringing llms into cognitive architectures uh mathis lichtenberger mostly it's me there's a few other folks out there um the thing is so in terms of people working on cognitive architectures one so here's the thing is there's this there's this fragmentation in the industry because all the people that are still doing chat bots

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In recent years, there has been an explosion of videos depicting psychedelic and meditative states. Some have speculated that these videos may be related to the AI art movement. So what is the connection between psychedelics, meditation, and AI art?

It is well-known that psychedelics can cause visual hallucinations. This is because psychedelics alter the way that the brain processes information. When you take a psychedelic, your brain is no longer able to make sense of the patterns it is seeing. This is why psychedelic art often features repeating patterns and fractals.

Interestingly, AI art also often features repeating patterns and fractals. This is because AI art is often generated by algorithms that are trying to identify patterns. However, due to the way that AI algorithms work, they often end up identifying patterns that are not actually there. This is similar to what happens when you take a psychedelic drug.

So what does this tell us about the connection between psychedelics, meditation, and AI art? It seems that they are all related to the way that the brain processes information. When you take a psychedelic drug, your brain is no longer able to make sense of the patterns it is seeing. This is similar to what happens when an AI algorithm tries to identify patterns.
