0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:46:00.000,0:46:07.500
Windows crashing all the time etc etc and then
then you would say you and the question is how
0:46:07.500,0:46:13.800
comes that Microsoft as a reliable uh related SQL
relational engine this is SQL Server which is very
0:46:13.800,0:46:20.100
popular still nowadays it always gets the correct
answer so it never fails why is that because well
0:46:20.100,0:46:28.080
Microsoft have to implement SQL their own SQL
Server engine by following The Logical rules
0:46:28.080,0:46:33.960
and they could not do anything else so that's
that's why another example joke that involves
0:46:33.960,0:46:40.680
Microsoft is would you trust an airplane which is
run by Windows would you ever fly on that airplane
0:46:40.680,0:46:47.460
well probably not but you do fly on airplanes why
because the soft so we are not so the software in
0:46:47.460,0:46:54.360
Airplane has not been by Tau but still there is
a major technology which uses logic to verify
0:46:54.360,0:47:01.500
the correctness of programs in complex systems in
safety critical systems like Railways airplanes
0:47:01.500,0:47:07.620
and stuff so you you can transform your program
in some logical form your software in some logical
0:47:07.620,0:47:14.100
form and then you ask to Theory improvers uh
questions something like it will ever be possible
0:47:14.100,0:47:20.040
that in sometimes in the future there will be a
configuration of labs engines air conditioning
0:47:20.040,0:47:25.500
whatever failing batteries and stuff so that at
some point this airplane will fall down because of
0:47:25.500,0:47:30.360
the software of course you want this the answer to
be no but you want to trust this answer you want
0:47:30.360,0:47:37.680
to ask this question and you want to ask to trust
the answer by by the system that gives that that
0:47:37.680,0:47:43.200
tries to to answer this question and the system
are based on logic they do logic based software
0:47:43.200,0:47:50.400
verification which is a very small part we also
do this this is somehow similar to the idea of
0:47:52.620,0:47:58.620
of proof that was talking was said by a lot before
but it's it's very limited to that particular
0:47:58.620,0:48:06.660
contest so the notion of trust is what logic gives
you for free and another example that it's what
0:48:06.660,0:48:11.400
what is why logic is that I would I would claim
the logic is the only thing that gives you that
0:48:12.060,0:48:19.860
it's uh well when we communicate and we start
to argue about one something we may argue as
0:48:19.860,0:48:24.420
much as you wish but there are some things that
I may say that you can never counter argue right
0:48:24.420,0:48:30.540
there is no way that you cannot trust what I say
because I'm following a logical argumentation and
0:48:30.540,0:48:38.400
following some patterns of reasoning which are
necessarily correct right and then of course
0:48:38.400,0:48:46.260
there are ways they can fool you so I can um I can
build an argumentation that is not really correct
0:48:46.260,0:48:51.720
in terms of logical steps but you don't fully
understand it because I confuse you with words
0:48:52.320,0:48:58.320
Etc and so you believe that the argumentation is
correct right and the point is logic is exactly
0:48:58.320,0:49:03.360
the study on which kind of reasoning paths are
corrected which not so once you have done this
0:49:03.360,0:49:10.740
study you can build the ideal discussion in any
discussion or you can build a logical Theory
0:49:10.740,0:49:17.160
improver a logical system that that guarantee that
whatever thing you ask them it's it's correct and
0:49:17.160,0:49:26.280
you cannot really disagree with it so that's the
notion of of why this is random logic excellent
0:49:26.280,0:49:33.600
thank you for that it's always oh go ahead odd I
I need the one maybe go take the charger excuse me
0:49:39.960,0:49:45.300
let's see I don't think we can stop or
pause the uh the the video I can stop
0:49:45.300,0:49:49.200
it but I don't want to have to restart
so I'll just cut this one section out um
0:49:51.600,0:49:58.440
uh but yeah uh this is this is great you guys
are are really phenomenal um at explaining these
0:49:59.520,0:50:05.700
um and we're building up to we're building up
to the um one of the key points um so what I'm
0:50:05.700,0:50:11.520
going to ask next is about how does how does the
Tau meta language help with building the software
0:50:11.520,0:50:17.280
and translating meaning between languages
whether it's natural language or controlled
0:50:17.280,0:50:22.320
language or you know machine language and how
does that also relate to software specifications
0:50:23.640,0:50:28.980
um because that's that's kind of the heart of
what Tau the Tau Network produces right that's the
