how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:16:35.160,0:16:42.660
and it should be able to launch uh no 10
okay looks like I need more stuff uh okay
0:16:42.660,0:16:48.840
final pause again finally got it running I
am so sorry I might edit this video to cut
0:16:48.840,0:16:54.300
out some of the uh some of the garbage okay
so it's running um you see the average time
0:16:54.300,0:17:03.180
per file is going down it's .07 seconds per um
per uh per file so that's that's pretty fast
0:17:04.440,0:17:13.980
um I had to go in and add a Keras GPU um and then
it worked finally um so it's using my GPU you see
0:17:13.980,0:17:19.680
uh let's see GPU memory oh wow if it filled
it up it used it used all available memory
0:17:20.880,0:17:29.580
um and it's using about 22 of my gpus resources
running at 46 C so that's not too warm
0:17:30.540,0:17:37.260
um let's see 46c I think that's about 120 degrees
maybe 130 degrees Fahrenheit um but yeah so it's
0:17:37.260,0:17:42.780
running nice and nice and smooth um if we come
over here to data we see we've already got
0:17:43.680,0:17:51.900
um 1300 out of 55 000 so it's going up pretty
fast uh yeah and the average time is continuing
0:17:51.900,0:17:57.720
to go down so that's not too bad all right so I'll
let this run let this finish um actually first let
0:17:57.720,0:18:02.520
me show you what it I think I already showed you
one but they're all going to be roughly the same
0:18:03.720,0:18:08.160
uh size because it's going to be
a chunk of no more than a thousand
0:18:09.000,0:18:15.600
um a thousand characters followed by the uh as
well as the um the vector so basically what I'm
0:18:15.600,0:18:21.720
doing is I'm preparing a whole bunch of data um
for to stuff into quadrant so that I can stress
0:18:21.720,0:18:27.660
test it so it'll be it'll be 55 000 um original
files but it'll actually end up being more
0:18:28.440,0:18:32.880
um total files so each of those is going to end
up being a data point all right so I'm gonna
0:18:32.880,0:18:39.000
pause the video again let this run we'll see how
long it takes total okay we have oh let me turn
0:18:39.000,0:18:47.820
my light back on there we go uh we have success it
took 3 500 seconds so just shy of an hour but the
0:18:47.820,0:18:57.900
average time was .063 seconds per file so that's
not bad um grand total it generated um let's see
