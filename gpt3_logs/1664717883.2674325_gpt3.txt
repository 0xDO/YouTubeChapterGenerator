0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:19:39.780,0:19:42.960
professional objective okay there we go
0:19:48.480,0:19:55.440
and also you see like this is pretty cheap so
you can just run it a few times and cherry pick
0:19:55.440,0:20:00.240
the best parts um let's see I'm a senior cognitive
architect with 16 years of experience my greatest
0:20:00.240,0:20:03.780
strength is that I think extremely fast I've
written pretty books about artificial cognition
0:20:04.980,0:20:08.520
um okay so this is just like
condensing it so this is not
0:20:09.780,0:20:18.300
exactly good um so let's go take a look
so professional objective yeah so this
0:20:18.300,0:20:22.080
is we're getting there but it needs
to be a little bit more concise so
0:20:22.080,0:20:27.180
um I'm gonna pause the video and find some
examples so we'll do a few shot here so one moment
0:20:29.400,0:20:35.040
okay so I went and found um an example
of a good professional objective
0:20:36.180,0:20:39.660
um I don't know if it's the best but
we'll see so we'll let this run real quick
0:20:40.440,0:20:45.600
um so I just invented a person applying to this
company and so you see like um professional
0:20:45.600,0:20:53.520
objective you know they just uh give a little bit
actually here um why I'm a great fit um and I was
0:20:53.520,0:20:59.400
trained in Berlin okay sure so because you want
to make sure that there that all the information
0:20:59.400,0:21:04.980
that makes it in here is available in the input
otherwise you're going to encourage confabulation
0:21:06.480,0:21:14.580
um let's see um I love Berlin so
okay so let's go ahead and run this
0:21:16.020,0:21:20.700
um because you know garbage and garbage out
applies if you if the input that you're giving
0:21:20.700,0:21:26.160
it is not and fully connected to the output then
you're telling it invent whatever it is that you
0:21:26.160,0:21:33.420
want um to want to do let's add a little
bit of output here so print and we'll say
0:21:33.420,0:21:40.440
um a new line new line um
uh let's see cover letter
0:21:43.620,0:21:45.540
and then we'll do the same thing for
0:21:47.100,0:21:54.900
print new line new line um and then
we'll do a professional objective
0:21:56.640,0:21:57.240
here we go
0:22:01.800,0:22:06.420
there we go okay so it did it did the style
transfer senior cognitive architect at Acme robot
0:22:06.420,0:22:10.740
science is excited to work on artificial cognition
full-time and create robots that can replace human
0:22:10.740,0:22:13.740
labor have 16 years of experience and written
three books in addition to publishing over
0:22:13.740,0:22:21.420
100 Source projects bam that is much better much
much better okay I I think I want to go get just
0:22:21.420,0:22:27.780
one more example for um for this but yeah let me
show you um let's see go back to Resume Builder so
0:22:27.780,0:22:36.060
professional objective number two so there it is
um actually that might be good enough yeah let's
0:22:36.060,0:22:42.360
call that a day so you just jump in here I'll
delete I'll delete mine you don't need to see mine
0:22:43.200,0:22:53.220
um but uh yeah so I hear leave one so that it's
there um but yeah so you just jump in here um
