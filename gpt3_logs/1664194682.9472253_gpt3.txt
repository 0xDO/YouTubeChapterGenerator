TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here for a quick video today i had someone message me i think it was on twitter or linkedin asking if i could help with a cover letter generator and i was like no i don't really do consulting anymore um but then i was looking through my video history and i saw that my email generator was very popular and so the email generator you can go go look at the code or look at the video but the email generator is pretty straightforward it just takes a blob of text and writes an email um if it can take a chat log and convert it into an email it can take a rant and turn it into an email so on and so forth so uh let's just this i and i wanted to try this i was thinking like okay that was a popular video resumes cover letters nobody knows how to write a cover letter right you don't ever do it um and i thought like at first i was like is this unethical because like a cover letter is supposed to be written by you to you know but i was like no like you people go to career coaches people have mentors actually um my fiance has a a friend who is like a professional um like career coach who helps with cover letters i ha i have another friend who who actually gave me advice for my resume so i was like no like it's just another tool um so i don't think there's anything unethical about using a machine to help you generate this thing um so yeah here we go the prompt that i wrote and this was my first attempt i didn't make any changes so the following is a conversation between a career coach and a job seeker the career coach asks the job seeker lots of questions to learn about them so they can write an awesome cover letter so it just says this is what's going on this is the goal the career coach also asks about the company and job they want as well as their work history strengths and passions finally once the coach has enough information they write an impressive cover letter so all i started was here was hey there what's your name and so this was actually an actual generation i posted it on twitter because i was like well that was easy my name is dave hi dave tell me a little bit about the company and job you're interested in and since i grew up watching wiley coyote and roadrunner i said acme dynamite i want to work at acme dynamite as a product specialist i love blowing stuff up that sounds like a really fun job what are some of

mostly i said demo charges to dispose of failed ordnance and demo and or demolished structures that sounds like a really exciting job i'm sure you have lots of experience with dynamite what are you passionate about dynamite i can tell while i think i have enough information and so then um it ended there and i i added this cover letter so that just tells the tells the machine okay time to write the cover letter and this is what it wrote to whom it may concern i am writing in regards to the open product specialist position at acme dynamite i'm immensely excited about the prospect of working for such a fun and innovative company i bring with me a wealth of experience with dynamite both in my previous role as an ordinance tech with the us army and my personal life i am passionate about dynamite and i firmly believe that i have the skills and knowledge to excel in this role now this is kind of generic kind of boilerplate so you could probably do some fine tuning to make a little bit more robust of a of a cover letter but you know what like for just off the cuff just some prompt engineering i'm really impressed with this in addition to my experience with dynamite i am also highly motivated and detailed oriented to individual i'm confident that i can be an asset to the acme dynamite team and i look forward to contributing to your success thank you for your consideration i look forward to hearing from you soon all right so let's do this again um so let's just like seeker um hi there what's your name while e coyote coach oh and so now stop that's not what you're supposed to do why didn't it work this time okay so i forgot to point out um uh coach and seeker so by having um here my name is we'll do period um if you i add the stop sequences because otherwise it kind of will will just go off and run like it like you just saw it um nice to meet you wiley uh what company are you looking to work for um i want to work for the um eat the road runner foundation coach okay great what job are you looking for um seeker i want to eat i'm definitely aging myself i see well what are your strengths um seeker i'm very hungry unmotivated to catch the roadrunner um [Music] i

do a time check i don't think i'm going to yeah this is only six minutes um i don't think i'm going to do this as a fine tuning project uh honestly i just did this because i'm waiting for other fine tuning jobs to finish um but i think this this

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Hi there, my name is David Shapiro and in this video, I'm going to be talking about a cover letter generator that I made.

This generator is pretty straightforward - it just takes a blob of text and writes a cover letter. I was thinking about whether or not this was ethical, because a cover letter is supposed to be written by you, to a specific company. But I decided that it's just another tool, and there's nothing unethical about using a machine to help you generate a cover letter.

So, if you have a chat log or a rant, the generator can turn it into a cover letter. All you need to do is provide some basic information about yourself and the company you're applying to.

I think this is a really useful tool, especially for people who don't have a lot of experience writing cover letters. It's a quick and easy way to get a well-written letter.
