The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody this is David Shapiro um today we're going to continue working on auto Muse 3 but what we're going to do is we're going to do a fine tuning project because um as many of you were observed um Auto Muse 3 didn't work too so well that's fine this is a research project so what I'm doing is I'm breaking out into scene simulation so basically what I'm going to try and do is create a fine-tuned model that will simulate just the scene aspect so we'll see how well it does but basically it's the idea is you give it a scene and then it just kind of advances you know whatever happens next in that scene and then we'll do something similar for maybe characters or events not sure yet but that's the point of experimentation so anyways I was trying to do it with just prompt engineering and it was Ultra frustrating so I'm gonna go more more conventional fine tuning so what I'm doing is I've got I'm generating synthetic data first so what I'm going to do is I've got this prompt where it says use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail we want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment Advanced narrative what is going on here so I give it a location a time a character and detailed description of the scene in events and some of you notice in previous videos uh something that I do to add more entropy is I add uuid at the top this creates internal entropy inside of the model so that you're going to get less repetition so basically I've got this is completely random and then three other variables which are populated here so I've got 11 locations seven times a day and then nine characters and I tried to get a little bit more Global because here's the thing if you just ask gpt3 to Generate random characters they're all going to be like vanilla white people so I added Michonne swathi Wang Alexi and Gabby just kind of manually saying like Okay it's only half white people um uh yeah so all together I think this is going to be over 600 um different settings um so the goal here first is going to be um to fill up this folder of just basic scenes um so generate scenes I've got the temperature turned up to one so that will add more entropy as well as the um the uuid okay so let's run this Loop once um just to test it to make sure so we'll do uh python generate scenes so it just says a bedroom Jenna a high school or middle of the night um Jenna wakes up in the middle of night her heart pounding in her chest you can hear strange noises coming from outside her window um Okay cool so this is pretty creepy shake the feeling that someone is watching her um so yeah this is a this is a great first scene um yeah uh so let's check the uh prompt uh yep so this is this is what it generated so you see this just random words and letters gpt3 doesn't know what to do with it so it's going to end up with a completely random internal State um so that increases more entropy which is really good if you're generating synthetic data but this is a phenomenal first scene okay and then that should have saved saved it out here um yep okay so this is one advantage of uh open AI having cut their uh their price um by 66 by two-thirds um here just do that um is that uh suddenly um generating synthetic data is way more economical so I'll just show you this we'll let it run for a minute um although these responses are kind of slow okay so then basically what I'm going to be doing next um so you see how it all has like these these uh these different scenes um God it's all so creepy it's like it wants to write like teen lit horror [Laughter] um okay anyways uh so the idea is I'll take these so this will just be a whole bunch of scenes and then I'll write an entirely different prompt to um to advance the plot like to say what happens next and so we'll have an original scene and then the next scene and what we want to do is fine tune a model that that really advances the plot one scene at a time um and the idea here is that we'll have something that can um that can really kind of simulate what's going on in a given scene um that's a long one um okay so anyways I'll pause it this will take a while um it's weird because it seems like open AI is slower I seem to remember these going faster anyways I'll pause it we'll come back this will probably take I don't know a couple hours okay I just wanted to show you a little bit of progress so I've gotten the next step um ready to go where I'm gonna generate the next scene so it's almost the same prompt but um I just have seen and detailed next scene a playground and um yeah so here's an example Bob steps into his bedroom blah blah and detailed next scene um yeah so this pretty generally uh reliably generates the next scene um okay so what gives like what am I gonna do with this because this is not um this is not including events or characters or anything um so I'm glad you asked what I'm planning on doing is I'll fine-tune another model that will take any given character and kind of simulate what they want to do next um so it'll take like uh the perspective the POV of one character or rather the interiority of a character and say like okay this is what I'm thinking this is what I want to do this is what I want to say um and so then by having a model that can simulate any the head of any character that can be injected into the scene um or the next scene and um can be used to kind of prompt it uh and shape it and then so the basically the the point of this is to ensure that these instructions are followed every time um but also that it's not going to get bogged down on any given um uh prompt because you didn't see this because I deleted the video because it was a disaster but with just prompt engineering on text davinci02 what happens is that it converges on one result and it stops following instructions and rather than advancing the plot so what I need is this sorry that microphone was over there I hope you can hear me um so what I need is for

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro explains that he is fine-tuning a model to generate synthetic data for a scene-by-scene simulation of a story. He begins by generating a random scene, then writes a prompt to advance the plot. He fine-tunes another model to take the perspective of a character and generate the next scene. The goal is to have a model that can advance the plot and follow the instructions of the prompt.
