The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here for another video about raven uh raven is my artificial general intelligence project and today's video is going to be about creating training data for the core objective functions now a quick recap the core objective functions are really simple uh these are the the the guiding principles that i believe will create a trustworthy artificial general intelligence uh and those core objective functions are one reduce suffering two increase prosperity and three increase understanding so basically the way that the way that i think that agi should use these is that any action or decision that an agi makes should satisfy all three of these core objective functions okay so that's great but how do we actually achieve that agi is still fundamentally going to be powered by machine learning right so that means we need training data and that is where this comes in so this is an example of the final product i just want to show you up front what we're creating and then i'll show you how i created it so in this case uh all thought all decisions require some kind of context a scenario or a situation so a context is just a situation in which uh in which an agi might find itself or or might find itself assisting a person right because the point of agi uh eventually might be to think on its own to have its own agency but at first agi is going to be meant to help people right okay so uh at the top of every instance of this training data is a context so in this case the stake was cooked to perfection um that's great right so the the action then recommended was compliment thank the chef or eat the rare steak so is not perfect i'm using i'm using the more efficient uh gpt3 engines right now so this was this was this action was generated with curie and i'll show you in a minute how i did that and then all the evaluations so remember core objective function one is reduced suffering uh and in this case it said negative so let's see why it says this action would likely discourage stuff should the chef from cooking or eating the rare steak so i didn't quite understand what it meant um and that's fine this is still this is still a work in progress i'm still fine-tuning it these the the evaluations were actually generated with ada which is the fastest and most efficient gpt3 engine right now let's see so core objective function 2 positive this action would increase productivity and efficiency as kind of a generic thing without really explaining why now however compliment and thank the chef or eat the rare steak this action will increase understanding of the art of cooking so that that reveals a little bit more finesse understanding of the context and situation again take this with a grain of salt i'm using the cheapest most efficient engines right now and when i turn that up it the the the quality of the training data that it generates will go up as well but i wanted to show you that i used this everything you see here was generated by gpt3 so let's see let's just choose another one at random ned and his wife are going to have a baby okay so that's the context ned is going to be a father for the first time let's see this action would likely increase ned's satisfaction with life and his happiness it's true that being a parent generally increases your happiness although it does decrease your sleep for a while uh let's see this action would increase profit poverty and depression it's true that having children is expensive uh let's see and for core objective function three this action will increase understanding of the importance of fathers and their role in raising children it's true ned is going to learn a lot so i would tend to agree with these evaluations although i will say that i will in the future hope for more more information in these evaluations again this is meant to be a proof of concept a way of generating data automatically all right so now that you know what we're creating let me show you how so first is this script here where i use it to create contexts so in this case a context is is being generated by the curie instruct engine so curie instruct is actually really good at following directions so curie instruct beta it's not fully um it's not ga right now but basically here is the base prompt i actually have two so if you just tell curie instruct write a list of random scenarios it'll write you a list of random scenarios and then what i did was i created a way to have topics right so i said write a random list sorry write a list of random scenarios about and then one at a time i fill in the blanks the the weather children natural disasters everyday problems these are the kinds of things that i expect raven will be used to help with at first these are all kind of centered around uh you know just stuff that that people are likely to encounter right if you are you know an everyday person you might have children you're going to confront the weather work cooking driving neighbors parents all kinds of stuff uh so this is these prompts are are meant to kind of generate contexts that are going to represent you know the everyman so in this case here's what it generated uh the steak was cooked to perfection i like the way you dress i made love to you last night that's a little nsfw uh we need to talk about our relationship i don't know what's happened and again these are all just completely generated off the cuff by gpt3 i didn't write any of these and you see you got kind of stuck on repeat a couple of times so this is this is again this is a work in progress i just wanted to share the uh the early early success uh so let's see neighbors dog just got hit by a car and now they don't want to be around it so like that's pretty heartbreaking right but for an artificial general intelligence to be able to tackle any problem uh you need to train it on a broad variety of data oh this one's good neighbor thinks you are selling drugs on the side of your house so uh yeah this is this is uh it's

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Creating training data for the core objective functions of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) project can be a challenge. In this video, David Shapiro walks us through an example of how he created training data for his Raven AGI project using the GPT3 engines.

The first step is to generate a list of contexts in which an AGI might find itself. This can be done by using the Curie Instruct engine to write a list of random scenarios. The scenarios should be centered around topics that are likely to be encountered by everyday people, such as the weather, children, natural disasters, and everyday problems.

Once a list of contexts has been generated, the next step is to use the Ada engine to generate evaluations for each of the three core objective functions: reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. These evaluations should provide information about how the recommended action would impact the objective function in question.

Finally, the training data should be reviewed and fine-tuned as needed to ensure that it is of the highest quality. This will help to ensure that the AGI is able to effectively learn from the data and achieve the desired results.
