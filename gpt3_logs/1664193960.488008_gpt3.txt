CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Anyone who says that the human brain can only hold seven things in its working memory is wrong. You try and actually summarize and figure out how much working memory you need to write a novel. Or, us novelists have a working memory that is several orders of magnitude greater than the typical person because you need to keep so much in your mind when you're writing a story. Unless there's something I'm missing, who knows.

Anyways, so back to the script. We get all the summaries for this particular book, we get the outline for this particular book, then we instantiate a new string called summary chunk. This is what accumulates those summaries in the prompts right here.

So, we go down to this one - the story so far. This is the summary, and so this is why it keeps getting bigger, is just because I just add to the next one each time, so it gets just longer and longer and longer every iteration.

Last chunk is open file that has the same name as the current summary, because remember the summaries and the chunks have the same name because the summary is just a summary of that chunk. So Alice in Wonderland summary 03 is just a summary of this chunk of 03.

Suddenly Alice had the moment to stop the thing before falling, and so then you look at summary Alice falls down a very deep well and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. So you see like, okay cool.

We've reduced the length but that's still not enough because it accumulates here. Okay, so we incrementally build up the summary next chunk prompt. So then we compose the prompt, which is basically just load this and populate it.

So, outline summary and chunk - the outline is populated with this variable. You can see that here. So we replace outline with the outline, replace the summary with the summary chunk, which is the string that keeps getting longer. And then we finally replace last chunk or sorry, next chunk with last chunk.

Last chunk is basically the current chunk, and the next chunk is I wrote a quick little script that you just pass it a file name or file path of a given summary or chunk and the name of the book. And it will just increment and figure out what the next chunk is for the completion. And then it'll just pass that data back.

So this is what it looks like. I had it output the length of each of each one as it goes. Let me let me add a little bit more so you can see. Let's see. So we'll have name, so that's the name of the book. And then we'll have summary, which is going to be the name of the file. So you'll be able to see like which well, I guess the summary is going to have the file name in it. So we'll just do summary. And then length of the prompt plus next chunk, so you can see how big that sample is.

Okay, so for Sherlock 01, the length is 5500 characters - that's about at the limit already. And then by the end for Sherlock 041, it's 14000 - so that's more than twice what we could expect to fit. And that's also not even like, not even the full length of the story. So I'm going to have to pause here and go back to the drawing board and do some thinking, some noodling on this. So stick around for part two. It should come out within the next week or so. Thanks for watching.
