0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

CHAPTER TITLE: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence



TRANSCRIPT:
0:26:40.380,0:26:46.500
um so first I think first thing we need to do
is get the whole thing Rewritten in such a way
0:26:47.400,0:26:52.440
that it is um that it can fit inside a
single prompt window because if we have
0:26:52.440,0:27:00.900
the whole the whole thing um a little bit more
con condensed excuse me then we should be able
0:27:00.900,0:27:05.640
to get a proper thing but we also need to
think about what kind of nodes do we want
0:27:06.720,0:27:13.800
um so you know which aspect you know the second
the second circuit did this uh Rico requires this
0:27:14.940,0:27:21.480
um and this other case it said that um so I
guess each node is going to be every case cited
0:27:22.380,0:27:28.080
yeah okay so the case cited and why I think
that's each node all right cool so let's
0:27:28.620,0:27:37.320
um Let's uh let's see um each node should be um
0:27:40.020,0:27:46.320
yeah each node should be
um a case uh case citation
0:27:48.360,0:27:55.740
um precedent or prior opinion I'm
probably using the wrong term but
0:27:55.740,0:28:04.800
um include uh what the heck was the
the um the parameter um my goodness
0:28:07.020,0:28:11.520
the uh what's the term why is my
brain doing this I need more coffee um
0:28:13.740,0:28:17.760
unique identifier property
prop not parameter property
0:28:18.780,0:28:29.340
um each node should have several
properties such as um date uh let's see
0:28:30.240,0:28:43.200
case number um involved parties um
reasoning for including in this opinion um
0:28:45.360,0:28:50.880
and other relevant um information okay
0:28:52.980,0:28:57.240
so let's let's see if if we can get
the nodes that we want because if
0:28:57.240,0:29:01.440
we can go ahead and convert each each
thing to to nodes that might save us
0:29:01.440,0:29:06.600
a step but I suspect we're going to have
to summarize it first this is really cool
0:29:10.320,0:29:14.580
I was really skeptical about chat GPT
but um I'm becoming less skeptical
0:29:20.160,0:29:25.380
oh this is good yes it's working
it's working it's working
0:29:30.600,0:29:34.260
okay so let's save this prompt
because this worked really well
0:29:35.220,0:29:44.280
um all right so I'll save this as um let's go up
here and we'll say prompt um let's see uh Json LD
0:29:45.480,0:29:50.520
um and then we'll do citation
nodes um so this is an example
0:29:52.500,0:29:58.380
we'll say example prompt okay so we got
we got the nodes that we want I believe
0:29:59.760,0:30:04.860
um oh man this is going to be fun because then I
can try and figure out how to take all this and
0:30:04.860,0:30:10.620
and visualize it I wonder if we can visualize it
with python um all right but let's let's go let's
0:30:10.620,0:30:16.080
let's pause for a second because this is only
half the document that's not good enough right
0:30:16.080,0:30:21.780
do we want it do we want to just read it raw and
just go straight to it let's try summarizing it
0:30:22.860,0:30:27.900
um and and let's see if we can get the whole
opinion in one document now here's the thing
0:30:27.900,0:30:33.780
some of these opinions are like 200 pages long so
how are we going to do that right because in order
0:30:33.780,0:30:37.860
for the thing to make sense you kind of do need
to have the whole thing but you also don't want
0:30:37.860,0:30:48.660
to lose detail right so let's think about this
for a second um let's see uh let's see rewrite
0:30:48.660,0:31:00.240
the following scotus up opinion um let's see
as a let's say as a list of assertions um
0:31:04.320,0:31:10.560
no we'll say we'll say summarize because
that summarize uh implies that you want
0:31:11.400,0:31:19.320
um to reduce word count um
remove Superfluous language um
0:31:21.660,0:31:25.980
while retaining specific details
0:31:28.680,0:31:33.180
um yeah let's see let's see if that works summary
0:31:40.920,0:31:46.380
okay yeah this those are good those
are good notes but it's not retaining
0:31:46.380,0:31:51.540
the information that I want to see such
as the nodes okay so rather than read
