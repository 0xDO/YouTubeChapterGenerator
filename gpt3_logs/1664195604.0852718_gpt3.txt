TRANSCRIPT: jewish so just say secular family in new york um so you know by giving it a geography it will the model will make certain inferences or assumptions about the beliefs of that person um and so if we can if we can demonstrate that that gpt3 can accurately or even maybe not even perfectly accurately but can at least closely approximate these different points of view and then work to find common ground that will uh that'll be an interesting experiment so i believe the universe is billions of years old and the earth is billions of years old i believe the universe came from the big bang and the earth was likely formed from a supernova okay i do not believe the bible is the infallible word of god i do not believe in creationism i do not believe that the bible supports creationism i believe that the bi i believe the bible supports evolution okay i do not believe in intelligent design sounds good okay so let's see if because you know the motivation is we're going to debate these things and so they're just kind of like introducing themselves so let's see what happen wait wait wait um sorry i forgot to update the uh the agent model all right so i'll just keep these in separate ones so we've got cletus so we'll switch back to cletus um there we go looks like he's just gonna repeat himself okay that's not what we wanted um maybe i'll add a moderator um whoops ben and moderator uh because a moderator will be like um i'll take the role of moderator put it that way moderator um [Music] uh gentlemen would you please introduce yourselves okay so then we'll add moderator um thank you for those introductions now that the um stage has been set would you like to make any opening arguments all okay so he says i will make an opening argument but i know the atheists will not like it so i'm going to make it short i'm going to give you a quote from the bible in the bible it says in the beginning god created heavenly earth etc etc god said let there be light um if you believe in the bible et cetera et cetera okay that's fine um i do not believe the earth is billions of years old i believe the earth was created by god in six days all right great and then we'll say we'll let ben talk but first we also need to swap back to the ben agent model so the reason that i'm doing it this way is basically i'm kind of simulating what if you had two different agents running in an ideal world each of these models would be like a fine-tuned model right you'd fine-tune a model that will take the persona of cletus or ben or whatever but instead i just have to swap it out by using an agent model at the top so it'll it'll kind of remind like this is oh i need to remove jewish we'll just say secular family okay and so then let's see what ben says in response i believe i believe i believe i believe yeah it got super super repetitive so this is this is a problem with um original da vinci um let's see let's well and one thing is i don't like to use frequency penalty and and presence penalty because then you end up with weird grammar like you'll end up with spaces between periods and stuff and it's like i don't want to modify the model like that so let's try this again um well i prefer to fiddle with temperature although some people were were showing me benefits of modifying talk p so let's do let's do top p of 0.1 turn that way down or that's not good addiction let's do 0.5 and see i'll make an opening argument okay this is a little bit better i believe the earth was formed from a supernova cool i believe that the universe is billions of years old i believe i believe i do not believe okay so as the moderator i will say gentlemen um you're basically just restating your beliefs um would you like to present actual evidence let us and then let's switch back over to the cletus agent model looks like it just ended okay it's repeating itself again um the bible is the word of god the bible is the word of god okay yeah uh let's try that again just to be fair cause you know that's that's that's what we're doing here we're just experimenting to see if it can do this okay it's repeating itself i think ken ham did a much better job of presenting evidence and it's possible that that that gpt3 just doesn't really understand okay it's repeating itself again let's turn the top p back up to see if maybe we're constraining the model too much uh there's evidence that the earth is only 6000 years old there's evidence that the earth was created six days there are fossils which prove the earth is only six thousand years old okay ben let's see what ben says about fossils oops there are rocks which prove that okay so this is fine um it's not quite as dynamic as i had hoped which is also not surprising because this is not a full cognitive architecture um i'm basically just relying on the model to kind of spit out what it predicts the next bit of text it's not actually doing any thinking behind the scenes let me do a quick time check or 14 minutes so one thing that i would do and let's let me copy all this out because this is this is helpful whoops this is helpful information so what do i mean by it's not a full cognitive architecture um there's no there's no like thinking going on behind the scenes so what i want to do now is say like okay given this situation let me like brainstorm an argument um and so that this would this would be happening in something kind of behind the scenes um excuse me uh so that like because when you're when you're having a debate with someone or explaining yourself you're not just speaking right you don't just have like a voice module that just starts blurting out words well some people do um but the point is is that you will think about the opponent's position think about your beliefs dredge up memories remember and construct arguments i do have another video about constructing arguments um and so that's what i mean by more like a cognitive architecture something that's going to think about it that's going to brainstorm what do i need to

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In a debate, it is important to be able to see and understand the other person's point of view. This can be difficult if the two people have different beliefs. However, if the two people can find common ground, it can be easier to have a productive discussion.

For this experiment, I am using two different "agents." One agent believes in creationism, and the other agent believes in evolution. I will be using a model called GPT3 to help the agents find common ground.

GPT3 is a machine learning model that can generate text. I am feeding it information about the agents' beliefs, and it is outputting text that represents a discussion between the two agents.

So far, the discussion has been about the Bible. The creationist agent has quoted a verse from the Bible, and the evolutionist agent has responded with evidence that the earth is billions of years old.

The experiment is ongoing, and I will continue to feed information to GPT3. I am curious to see if the agents can find common ground on other topics, such as the age of the earth or the origins of the universe.
