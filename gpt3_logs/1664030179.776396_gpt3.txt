0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:53:57.660,0:54:05.280
000 characters long um so clearly this is like
yeah this this this is quite a bit um I think
0:54:05.280,0:54:11.820
what I'm gonna do uh because that's that's well
how many tokens is this let's plug this into
0:54:13.620,0:54:24.780
50 5 000 tokens so we want it to be maybe half
that maybe not quite as long so what we'll do is
0:54:25.620,0:54:33.960
we'll do um just a little bit less research and
a little bit less a little bit less brainstorming
0:54:35.100,0:54:39.000
um so hopefully that will make it a little bit
more reasonable because what I'd like to be able
0:54:39.000,0:54:47.220
to do is to do the final Cleanup in one window
um and we can't do that right now um Okay so
0:54:47.760,0:54:51.660
we've got this I've got it so it'll save it
out to file I wish that I had done this the
0:54:51.660,0:54:57.300
first time but what we're going to do is we're
going to choose an entirely different topic
0:54:57.300,0:55:08.220
because I tested it on one topic um so I want
a blog post about the history of the printing
0:55:08.880,0:55:18.540
press I'd like to know how it
influenced religion politics and War
0:55:19.140,0:55:28.560
throughout history and up through the Modern Age
um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and kick this off
0:55:30.600,0:55:35.100
generate blog and then we'll come back with
a brand new blog and then we will get into
0:55:36.480,0:55:42.240
um we'll get into the um the process
of improving a Blog automatically
0:55:44.760,0:55:49.920
um why is it doing nothing did it not
do any research oh there it is okay
0:55:53.400,0:55:57.540
there we go um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and
pause it and we'll come back in just a second
0:56:01.800,0:56:04.920
okay we have a blog post about the printing press
0:56:06.480,0:56:11.160
um and I think I actually lied I think I'm gonna
call it here because this is actually not bad
0:56:12.600,0:56:20.220
um and it doing improving an existing document
is worth its own project so I think what's going
0:56:20.220,0:56:27.240
to come after this is I'll have one video or
a project about pulling from external sources
0:56:27.240,0:56:32.040
like how to search and automatically compile
sources because that has applications all
0:56:32.040,0:56:39.120
over the place such as automated research for
like Academia not just writing blogs and then
0:56:39.120,0:56:43.380
automatically improving stuff at basically
being an editor is a whole other function
0:56:44.400,0:56:54.540
so we will call this a day get status get
add git commit am all done and get push
0:56:55.920,0:57:02.160
so uh yeah so there's a blog post out here
it is now 10 000 characters long which means
0:57:02.160,0:57:08.880
that it should fit into a single um
yeah window so you could in theory
0:57:09.420,0:57:15.000
ask gpt3 hey take this blog post and rewrite it
if you want to I'm not going to worry about it
0:57:16.020,0:57:23.280
um because yeah this video is already plenty long
and you have you now have an end to end process of
0:57:23.280,0:57:30.780
prompt chaining and recursive prompting um in
order to generate you know be very generative
0:57:30.780,0:57:34.500
and make something better remember use
this responsibly I am not responsible
0:57:34.500,0:57:42.120
if you uh use this to do something unethical
um yeah this is on you uh anyways thanks for
