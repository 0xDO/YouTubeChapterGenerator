CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In his video, "Manner Forever," David Shapiro discusses the control problem and how it relates to artificial intelligence (AI). He argues that in order to ensure that AI does not kill everyone, it is important to increase understanding of the impact that actions can have on other people.

Shapiro explains that this understanding goes beyond just theory of mind. He argues that in order to understand whether or not someone is suffering, it is necessary to have theory of mind. However, he notes that Eve has increased understanding by providing support and empathy to the user. Additionally, Eve has encouraged the user to communicate openly about their struggles, which may help the user to feel less alone and more understood.

Shapiro concludes by stating that while there is always room for improvement, the current state of AI is a win. He thanks the viewer for watching and ends the video.
