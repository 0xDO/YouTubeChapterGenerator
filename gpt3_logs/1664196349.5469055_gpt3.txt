TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody David Shapiro here with your daily state of the industry update um as often happens my news feed helpfully handed me this this morning Hydra attention efficient attention with many heads um it was a study just released with uh from Georgia Tech and meta okay so the abstract is pretty straightforward says while Transformers have begun to dominate many tasks in Vision applying them to large images is still computationally and difficult a large region for this is that self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens which in turn scales quadratically with the image size on larger images such as 1080p over 60 percent of the total computation in the network is spent solely on creating and applying attention matrices we take a step towards solving this issue by introducing Hydra attention an extremely efficient attention operation for vision Transformers paradoxically this efficiency comes from taking multi-head attention to its extreme by using as many attention heads as there are features Hydra attention is computationally linear in both tokens so rather than quadratic it is linear in both tokens and features with no hidden constants making it significantly faster than standard self-attention in an off-the-shelf vitb16 by a factor of the token count moreover Hydra retains high accuracy on imagenet and in some cases actually improves it okay so that's that's this in in other words instead of having one two you know or you know probably a a a square um number of attention heads like one two four eight sixteen they just go to have as many attention heads as possible and what they found was that you get uh you get efficiency increases so I'm gonna go ahead and Skip down to the results um to 4.4 results so we would present our final accuracy in flop count using Hydra attention in Tab 2 which I believe is right here yep so you see accuracy um they're able to with just a couple of Hydra layers they improved accuracy a little bit but then you look at the when they added more layers the total floating operations per second went down four percent and the speed was increased by 10 percent um and then this is where I'm not quite sure that I get it um because a little bit further down they say that that's 197 times faster I think that's because it's in parallel so maybe each head is faster but then when you have multiple heads you're working in parallel I'm not quite sure I haven't read it I haven't done a close enough reading yet but anyways we present our final accuracy in flop count using Hydra and Tab 2 compared to standard OT et cetera Etc and other otd methods on imagenet 1K Hydra attention achieves 2.54 higher accuracy compared to other otd methods when replacing all layers and when replacing fewer layers Hydra attention can strictly outperform the Baseline standard attention model with two layers accuracy increases okay so they're just saying what the uh what the the thing does okay larger images to explore whether Hydra attention retains these gains with more tokens in Tab 3 we fine-tune the backwards replacement model from uh from figure four at 38 384 pixel resolution for 30 epics using the hyper parameter suggested in 31 this results in a model almost three times the number of tokens which should both accentuate in different and difference uh both accent both accentuate the difference between otd and ot2d attention um and indicate whether the Global Information propagation strategy of Hydra attention is effective at these higher token counts and indeed in Tab 3 we see the same Trend with the 224 pixel images Hydra attention can increase accuracy by uh almost 0.6 percent and throughput by Point by 4.1 with two layers or keep accuracy the same and increase throughput by 15.4 limitations okay but Hydra attention is 197 times faster than standard attention so this is I'm not quite sure where they got that other than the only other place it appears here so I'm not sure if they're saying like Global time was that much many times faster not sure but if it was 197 times faster that is a huge order of magnitude Improvement and it's not entirely surprising because we saw that kind of improvement between Google Universal sentence encoder version four and five where it's literally a hundred times faster just with an algorithmic improvement such as this so if if I'm misunderstanding this paper I'm sure someone will comment anyways but I you know while this number does sound extreme it's not surprising to me okay so so why is the maximum flop count reduction only four percent well it turns out that with vitb 16 uh with 224 by 224 only 4.1 percent of the total model flops reside in creating and applying attention matrices with Hydra tension this is reduced down to 0.02 percent wow okay essentially eliminating the cost of attention in the model while this does result in raw throughput increase of up to 10.2 percent we can clearly do better of course the story changes if you increase the image size we repeat this computation for different size images and the computation of standard attention balloons all the way up to 58 with 100 with uh 1280 pixel images while Hydra attention remains negligible at 0.02 okay so basically this makes the the first step computationally uh inexpensive no matter no matter what size um we test 3 384 and speed up to Hydra tension up to 27 increase however further work needs to be done to validate Hydra attention on tasks that use more tokens um though in those tasks we'd be comparing against the local window uh attention used in vit I'm not sure what that is um which already which has already shown to be effective for large token regimes in images compared to local window attention Hydra attention uses only four percent fewer flops um okay in general the usefulness of Hydra attention allies in its generality local window attention is a powerful solution for dense image prediction but quickly becomes cumbersome with token sparsity such as with masked

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

A new study from Georgia Tech shows that Hydra attention, an extremely efficient attention operation for vision Transformers, can significantly improve accuracy and speed for large images.

The study found that with just a few Hydra layers, accuracy was improved and the total floating operations per second went down by 4 percent, while speed was increased by 10 percent. Moreover, Hydra was found to be 197 times faster than standard self-attention.

The study also found that Hydra attention can increase accuracy by 0.6 percent and throughput by 4.1 with two layers, or keep accuracy the same and increase throughput by 15.4.

Overall, the study showed that Hydra attention is a powerful solution for dense image prediction, and can be useful for tasks that use large amounts of data.
