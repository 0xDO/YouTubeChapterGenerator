The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here for a uh midnight video um it is three in the morning because this is how my brain works um if i if i wake up and my brain says hey you've got a problem to solve i can't go back to sleep until i solve it um i don't know if it's i don't know what it is but this is this is just how i've become since i started working on this stuff so i had an insight in the last video i was making about uh working memory and task sets and all this fun stuff so to set the stage let's just ask gpt3 to uh define these let's see write a formal academic definition now let's say explanation of working memory oh whoops you probably can't hear me there we go you need the microphone to hear me okay um oh wow this is a big long description okay so we'll go back up to the top working memory is a cognitive system that allows individuals to temporarily store and manipulate information the capacity of working memory is limited and it is thought to play an important role in many cognitive tasks such as reasoning problem solving and comprehension working memory is thought to be composed of two distinct systems the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch pad that sounds cool visuospatial sketchpad that sounds like a ska band [Laughter] are you ready for the video spatial sketchpad yeah okay sorry this is super unfiltered dave because it's three in the morning um okay the phonological loop is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of verbal information okay so that's how we that's how we form um that's how i'm planning on speaking to you while the visuospatial sketchpad is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of visual and spatial information makes sense working memory is believed to be important for many cognitive tasks oh this is just repeating itself for example when solving mathematical problem one must first understand the problem retrieve relevant information from long-term memory and then manipulate this information to arrive at a solution all of these processes likely involve working memory comprehension also likely relies on working memory when reading a text one must be able to remember the information in the text long enough to understand it yes with this is especially true for difficult and technical texts there's evidence that the capacity of working memory is limited etc etc okay so why is this relevant the reason it's relevant is because gpt3 has no working memory um it has only what is called recall or embedding so that means for artificial cognition we need to give it working memory which is what i was working on in another video but what i wanted to do is just create a video just explaining these concepts so that you can better understand like because i'll sometimes say that gpt3 is magical and it's magical because it has 400 lifetimes worth of knowledge embedded in it it is not magical because it doesn't have working memory which is like one of the most basic things of human cognition so if i say it's magical i'm referring to the volume of data that's embedded and the fact that it can just kind of improvise on the fly anywhere but if i say gpt3 is not magical it's because it doesn't have working memory um okay so if we get rid of all that and then we say a formal academic explanation of task set um and we'll put in this in neuroscience just so that way it knows we'll say okay a task set is a collection of related tasks that an individual must perform in order to complete a larger goal in neuroscience oh here i'll let it finish okay in neuroscience a task set is often used to refer to the set of tasks that an individual okay so must complete in a particular experiment or study task set size refers to the number of tasks in a task set task sets with a large number of tasks are more difficult to complete than those with a smaller number of tasks so the video that that reminded me of this was the one about writing a novel with gpt3 so novel writing is is a complex task set because you're doing a whole bunch of stuff at once so when you're writing a novel you are synthesizing prose you're imagining dialogue you're you're actually using theory of mind to simulate other brains for the characters you're keeping track of lore you're keeping track of a plot right so this is why writing novels requires many iterations or revisions is because your brain can only do so much at one time um and but also with writing a novel you we have to we have to simulate these task sets with gpt3 now there's evidence that gpt3 can handle multiple tasks at once but maybe it's just confabulating that because all gbt3 is done is it's trained to um it's trained to copy human text right so it might have the appearance of handling multiple tasks but really it's only doing one task so if you have a if you have a problem in gpt3 that requires a task set that is multiple tasks so this is also called cognitive control i'll add that too let me add that um cognitive control because that's an important concept to understand when breaking down these things um for gpthree okay um here we are the task set size effect is the finding that performance on a task set decreases as the number of tasks increases so that being able to have a larger task set is going to be required for agi right and so by breaking down cognitive tasks into individual discrete tasks and running them in parallel that's going to be one of the ways to achieve agi which is what i'm working on in my current cognitive architecture research this effect is believed to be due to the fact that individuals have limited amounts of attention and working memory see there's that term working memory which are necessary for completing multiple tasks simultaneously the task set effect size has important implications for real world settings such as workplaces where individuals often have to complete multiple tasks simultaneously for example the effect suggests that it is more difficult um yeah okay so it's just repeating

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The task set size effect is the finding that performance on a task set decreases as the number of tasks increases. This effect is believed to be due to the fact that individuals have limited amounts of attention and working memory, which are necessary for completing multiple tasks simultaneously. The task set size effect has important implications for real world settings such as workplaces, where individuals often have to complete multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, the effect suggests that it is more difficult to complete multiple tasks when there are more tasks in the set.
