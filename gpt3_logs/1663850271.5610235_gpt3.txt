how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

the training data for gpt3 instruct that they end
up in this and it's because it's because they paid
0:10:26.580,0:10:34.260
a whole bunch of contractors to just generate
a bunch of content um so anyways side tangent
0:10:35.340,0:10:41.220
um let's see but they can help her Escape her
current lifestyle if she's willing to work for him
0:10:41.760,0:10:48.960
Okay so Sabrina is initially hesitant but the
man is persistent and eventually agrees to work
0:10:48.960,0:10:52.980
for him he tells her that his name is Lucius and
that he's a member of a secret society that is
0:10:52.980,0:10:58.860
working to overthrow the Roman Empire now that's
cool all right you got my attention he tells her
0:10:58.860,0:11:01.980
that they need someone with her knowledge of
the city and the people in it to help carry out
0:11:01.980,0:11:09.420
their plans oh this is this is uh some Espionage
Sabrina is apprehensive but excited she agrees to
0:11:09.420,0:11:13.800
help him and over the next few months becomes an
invaluable asset to their cause she helps them to
0:11:13.800,0:11:18.720
gather information about the city and the people
in it and who to trust she develops feelings for
0:11:18.720,0:11:24.000
Lucius which complicates matters that's where it
gets spicy eventually leads to the group downfall
0:11:27.360,0:11:32.400
um Sabrina is captured and imprisoned oh
wow everyone is executed that's horrible
0:11:33.600,0:11:40.200
um and she thinks she wonders what she could have
done to do make things differently she's executed
0:11:40.200,0:11:48.240
and the Roman Empire continues to rule England
for centuries to come wow okay that's really heavy
0:11:49.860,0:11:58.620
um yep definitely intensifying um I guess I I
yeah the the idea of Science Fiction was kind
0:11:58.620,0:12:05.460
of overruled by everything else um but yeah okay
that's yeah that's we've got we've got something
0:12:05.460,0:12:10.380
that can generate some pretty intense plots here
um and so then as I alluded to at the beginning
0:12:10.380,0:12:16.620
of this I am writing uh or sorry working
on a plot writing or a novel writing thing
0:12:17.340,0:12:22.920
um but you need a premise to start you need that
seed that kernel and so by having something that
0:12:22.920,0:12:29.580
can generate 292 billion different um arrays of
appeal factors oh and also I can make it I can
