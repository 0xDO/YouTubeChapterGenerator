TRANSCRIPT: back to it and that's what this this loop is here so you basically you you expand your story until you get to a point where you're satisfied and then you refine it you expand refine expand refine expand refine until you end up with a final product so that is the end loop and that's going to be a lot of fun to figure out let me tell you now with with plotter it's not much different once you get to the end it's just that you have a little bit more structure and a little bit more planning and then once you get to because all a novel is is a list of scenes right so then once you get to the list of scenes like you've got all the scenes written out then you just iterate over those and refine them and i say that's all you do it's not quite that simple um but from a high level standpoint that's what it is so um the auto muse 3 slash the scene and character simulation that got to this point so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go i started a new repo called plotter novel writer and all i'm going to try and do is get to here today so one of my most popular videos of all time was the movie script generator where i already generated um 200 premises um sci-fi romance mystery fantasy um so on uh so i copied that and that is here so plotter novel writer so here we go what i'm going to do is i'm just going to try and i'll grab a random premise random premise and then i'll generate title theme setting characters plot um so that's what i'm going to try and do and i'm just going to do like just phase 1 of plotting um today because that's gonna be i mean that's gonna be enough um okay so i'll go you don't need to see me do the baseline of coding this is the introduction so let me get started on this i'll pause it and then we'll come back and i'll show you what i've got okay we're off to a good start so i did a quick um prompt engineering to get a title generator it's not perfect but um uh it's it's it's it's all right so um the righteous view i love that um okay the invasion of the malachim yeah so that's that's that's doing good the iss enterprise versus the malekin all right so we'll copy this and we'll save this as uuid um and then we will do this premise and then we'll cut that out we'll save this as prompt title and so the reason that we're starting here is uh we'll start with title theme setting characters plot that's as far as i'm going to try and get today okay so then we come back here we'll do um from uuid import uuid four okay so i've got as far as this just making um picking picking a random premise so cls let me make this bigger for you properties good grief can you tell how upregulated i am um all right so python plotter the human race has reached a point where we have exhausted all of earth's resources okay so let's plug this in just to see how it handles this so premise and then we'll clear that out perfect title the war for earth kind of generic the war for earth 2.0 colonialism the last stand um okay let's see unique perfect title let's see if that makes it a little bit better the last war for earth okay the last colony alien nation the last battle okay sure fine we can come up with we can fine tune a better better title um in the future but that's fine okay so we'll do unique perfect title pithy catchy and memorable uh so on and so forth all right so then we will say prompt equals open file prompt title.txt dot replace uuid with string uuid 4 and then dot replace premise with the premise and that should be good and then title yes title equals gpt3 completion prompt and then we'll do temp sure equals 1.0 um because if you notice here i turn the temperature up to one but in this function i have it default to 0.7 um so that's fine um all right so we'll get a title and then we will do um well i guess that's fine i can just i can i can store all this let's see i probably yeah we'll do stories so then we'll save it all to um to a directory in here uh let's see so i'll probably just timestamp the stories um yeah okay let me do a little bit more work and then we'll be right back okay so i got the title um so it'll generate a title and then it'll set a story path um and it'll just generate the um make a make a folder for it so i'll have a folder to store everything for that story so it'll be able to run repeatedly so let me just show you real quick what i mean cls python plotter01 uh unexpected argument temperature oh i need to change that to temp okay try it again oh and i probably also need um gpp3 logs there's the premise whenever files incorrect stories mate oh interesting yeah so it added quotation marks um so if we go in here it said the unique perfect title the soul mate connection a journey to love that's actually not too bad um okay so i need to remove quotation marks from the title name all right and this is why you test your kit your your code kiddies okay so story path so we will also do dot replace remove double quote and we'll do with nothing and then we'll also replace we'll replace single quotes just in case um because those don't play nice with file names um yeah there we go uh actually here title we'll go ahead because we don't want we don't want those in the title anyway so we'll put those there all right let's try it again delia is a small town librarian oh i didn't have it output anything but it completed okay so theoretically the librarian and the murder lovely um and then stories librarian and the murder okay cool and then title librarian and the murder perfect um let's see i probably need to remove and and the as well um so it'll be just like librarian murder okay actually no that's fine i'll leave that okay so we can generate a story that way and if there is something if there is a duplicate it will probably bomb um but that's okay because i've got 200 premises okay so next up we need the whoops that come back we need the theme generate a theme all right and so that takes us back up to the playground so i have um here let's give another one all right given the following

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The plotter is a tool that helps you create a novel by expanding and refining your story until you have a final product. It is similar to the movie script generator, but with more structure and planning. To get started, you first need to generate a title, theme, setting, characters, and plot.

Today, I'm just going to focus on the first phase of plotting. I'll start by picking a random premise and then generate a title, theme, and setting. I'll use the plotter to expand my story until I'm satisfied, and then refine it. I'll continue to expand and refine my story until I have a complete novel.
