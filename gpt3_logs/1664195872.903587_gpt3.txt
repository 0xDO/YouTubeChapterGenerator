The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with a uh the first video in a new tutorial series so this is python and gpt3 from the ground up so if you don't know anything about python or gpt3 and you want to get into it start here so this is going to be the boot camp starting from zero starting from scratch so the first thing you're going to want to do is take a look at this comic from xkcd from 10 15 years ago it basically it's just making fun of how simple python is the the punch line is um how are you flying and i just i just typed import anti-gravity and then of course he sampled all the things in the medicine cabinet and then now he's flying um anyways so the first thing you do is you go to python.org downloads it downloads pretty quick you do install now and so the first time i did this i missed this because we're doing something so simple you don't need to worry about virtual environments so you make sure to click add python to path and you can expand here to see what else it'll do documentation that's fine pip you definitely need pip so pip is the pack package manager for python which allows you to install other stuff that python needs so that's fine install for all users you don't always need to do that but i do so that puts it right here in the standard thing again don't worry about virtual environments we're just going to install it as the system interpreter using virtual environments is more advanced so we're not going to worry about that so there you go i actually uninstalled python entirely just so to show like going from scratch um so this is python 3.10 that's the latest and greatest it's the same process uh probably forever it's been it's been the same for all of 3.3. it didn't used to come with pip you used to have to install that separately so the fact that they they include that now is is nice let me close my console so once this is done it'll add python to the um there we go okay so python dash dash version 3.10.5 there we go so pip install pip dash dash upgrade so you can do this it's recommended that that's the first thing that you do and because it upgrades your package manager so the command here is pip so that's the python package manager install pip so you're telling it to install something that's already there and then the dash dash upgrade tells you to upgrade now the very next thing you're going to want to do is install openai if you want to use gpt3 this is the module or the package that you can use and all you got to do is copy that to clipboard and you do control paste or shift insert for a command line pip install open ai and this is most of the way there so it'll run all the dependencies and unless your system is weird or something you shouldn't get any errors here this is pretty straightforward and if you already have open ai installed then you can just add that dash dash upgrade and away it goes that's giving me a few few notices yep which is not on path that's fine successfully installed ta-dah okay so we're most of the way there you're most of the way ready but now what how do you get code so if you watch my channel you'll know that i have i do a lot of code and i put all of my code up on github so how do you get stuff quickly and easily the answer there is you use git so you go to git dash scm.com downloads or slash download sorry you get you download git i've already got it but i'll go ahead and install the update so you can see the process so we will install git for windows um install removing previous get version so this is pretty much the same process you'll go through so what git does it is an open source code management tool it has become the standard code management tool globally we don't need to see the release notes okay so now that git is installed what do you do then what i do next or what i'll have you do next is you go to your command line um and you go to this repo so this is the this is the tutorial repo i'll put all the all the code and demos here so you go to this you click code the big green button and you see where it says https ssh or github cli just leave it on https that's the standard you click this for copied you come back in here you go to the root which you don't have to that's what i do you can also do cd um oh what was it no it's cd uh was it user i don't remember um user der whatever um i always copy stuff down to root just because uh it's shorter that way um so get clone and then shift insert um for for this uh and so this this goes to the python gbt3 tutorial dot git so the dot get file is the configuration file that it's going to use to download the entire repo so get clone and it down downloads it nice and quick then you do cd python and use tab to complete so tab is autocomplete so like if you type in windows and then complete like just win tab that'll do complete you can do program files and there's two different ones program data program files but we're going to go into python and then we'll do dur now windows started integrating uh linux command so i think ls dash all nope it doesn't work okay but dura will show you everything in the file which right now since i just started it it's fine okay so for review we've downloaded python and we've downloaded git and then we've cloned down this repo we've also installed um open ai so we're like right off the bat we've we've got a nice minimalist clean environment the last thing that i want you to download is notepad plus plus and this is if you're on windows actually i think notepad plus plus is on linux as well notepad plus plus is a basic text editor wait that's not what i wanted there we go um so they do have that deceptive thing make sure you click the the download on under the the lizard icon um notepad plus plus it is a minimalist development environment there are develop there are ides integrated development environments um like pycharm i stopped using pycharm years ago because it has its own environment variables and all sorts of other complex stuff that is just it's way
