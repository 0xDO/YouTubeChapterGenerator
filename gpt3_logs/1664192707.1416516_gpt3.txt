TRANSCRIPT: from here any big goals for the channel or just going day by day yeah um so my my goal has always been um to bring about uh or to or to create a fully autonomous artificial cognitive entity um so to that end i've started you know well i'm not gonna say a final push because i i might run into limitations um that i'm not aware of yet but um yeah so like is to build is to build raven which is a going to be a fully fully autonomous um machine that has several criteria one it's got to be auto didactic um it's got to learn on its own um it also has to be robust meaning that it will adhere to its own objective functions um that it will be able to learn to adhere to those objective functions better on its own um and a slew of other things it's uh i'm working on defining it in my current book which is symphony of thought um orchestrating artificial cognition and so basically this book is going to be the blueprint and the exp and and uh capturing the experiments and the architecture of of raven version one which is going to be a little bit more sophisticated than my first book natural language cognitive architecture so natural language cognitive architecture is like um this is like going to be your basic chat bot compared to raven when raven is done because natural language cognitive architecture only has two loops an inner loop and an outer loop whereas raven is going to have hundreds dozens dozens or hundreds of interconnecting loops um they're all going to be interacting in different ways um so yeah that's uh that's that is that is my eternal goal that is the primary purpose that i'm doing any of this that's the whole reason that i started my youtube channel and the discord is just it's all in service to that higher goal um great question thanks for asking that jordan um yeah we're at just over an hour so i'll go ahead and call it a night um thanks everyone for jumping in on this uh this live stream um i had no idea how to go or how it would go um but yeah this has been really great you guys have asked some really engaging questions um so yeah just thanks everyone for participating and um you know i know we might get bogged down by the by the drudgery of day to day stuff but we are living in one of the most exciting times in human history um we are at the knee of the curve right now so have a good night and uh talk to everyone again soon

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

My goal for my YouTube channel is to bring about or create a fully autonomous artificial cognitive entity. To that end, I have started a final push to build Raven, which will be a fully autonomous machine that has several criteria. It must be able to learn on its own, and it must also be robust, meaning that it will adhere to its own objective functions. I am currently working on defining these criteria in my book, Symphony of Thought. This book will be the blueprint for Raven version one, which will be more sophisticated than my first book, Natural Language Cognitive Architecture. Natural Language Cognitive Architecture is like a basic chat bot compared to Raven. Thanks everyone for participating in this live stream. I had no idea how it would go, but it has been really great. You guys have asked some really engaging questions.
