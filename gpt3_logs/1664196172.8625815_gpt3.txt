The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here um today we're going to test a uh semantic search um uh search engine uh database so what is this um there are a few major contenders out here so first we've got we v8 vector search engine it is i think it has a community edition start free pay as you go yeah yeah yeah so um there's that one there's pinecone which is cloud-based so this is sas there's milvis which is open source and runs locally on docker and then there's quadrant or cudrin which is uh very small and it's also runs on docker so i'm going to start with this one because it is tiny so pre-built docker image only 40 megabytes um so this is where we're going to start today so let me close a few tabs so first if you've never used docker before here let me make sure you're looking at me um there we go sorry about that um so if you've never used docker before this is what it looks like um docker desktop it allows you to run containers so you can run linux based containers uh on windows or mac or whatever so there's one thing that you need first is um you need to download the uh windows uh the the linux kernel to run on windows download this install it and then reboot and then you can download and install docker desktop which also requires a reboot anyways so docker there's hub.docker.com which hosts it's like it's like a package container but for for images um and so basically when you do a docker pull um this is where it pulls from pulls from docker hub um yeah so getting started is super simple once you install wsl if you need it if you're on mac or linux then you don't need wsl and you can just install docker desktop directly so what we'll do is we will do docker pull uh no i'm going to go ahead and do this so and i've got a um so i'm gonna i'm gonna have all the code that i do in this github repo by the end so we're just starting from scratch um okay so docker pull quint and you see you it runs through its process here let me make this just a little bit bigger font we'll go up to 28. there we go okay all right so now what do we do um we've got downloaded image so so on and so forth and if we go over here um you'll see that quadrant is now here and you can do it here too like you can search um i actually no this is um yeah this is this is uh my images um how do you i think there's a way to search anyways point being um i got it downloaded from here so let's check out their quick start guide so we'll just go through um so let's see i guess first i need to run it um what are the because this is not going to be running um actually i think i can just oh yeah optional settings host port that's fine okay so when you when you run an image it just starts up right here um and it it kind of has a bunch of default settings so let's make sure that it's working can't be reached connection refused what's the problem let's see if what did i do wrong they're assuming that you know how to run it docker run ah here we go so this this this is what i'm missing here let me zoom in um so one thing to keep in mind is with docker it's virtualization and so there's a virtual network that you need to port or map to your real network so this won't work so let me axe this and what i so what i saw here is run you know dash p so that's port so that will map port 6333 um 6333 um to port 6333 6333 yeah okay um so that'll map it from the from the in inside to outside um and then we can go ahead and kill this delete forever um we can come back here um let's see so because it'll it'll keep it'll keep your um your original copy so optional settings um six three three six three three wait why did it oh interesting here let me try it here there we go that's what you wanted to see allow access and then it should be yep quadrant quadrant containers view details okay so that's just a copy of the output um let's see open with browser there we go okay so now it just spits back its version so it's in version 0.9.1 that's fine that's what we would expect okay so let's come back to their quick start guide all right so first let's create a collection with dot product metric so we're going to say we're going to try something with a doc a vector size of 4 and we're going to use dot product as our distance so let's copy this and then we'll come here actually now i need a new cdq drint demo and then we'll uh distance is not recognized oh it didn't like it okay let's close this as my last project all right so it doesn't like the backslashes so we'll get rid of the backslashes data raw okay so curl is installed in windows now by default so curl x put so put is the http command so we're going to go to localhost 6333 collections test collection content type and then it'll start with this data raw so when you do dash dash data raw you're basically sending it raw json with curl okay cls here this is too big it didn't like that either i wonder if it doesn't like it let's see unmatch close huh this missing url i wonder if it doesn't like it because this is on windows let's try that see if it gets rid of some of these errors so difference between linux and windows is sometimes single quote versus double quote yeah okay so that fixed that part so then how do you quote [Music] let's see uh curl windows tutorial you can tell how free how infrequently i use this um let's see json let's see um curl raw data json and we'll say windows okay is with double quotes okay is it really that simple all right so we'll just try and change it to double quotes i would think that it wouldn't work because it'll exit it out but we'll see he must be string length result null status error json d serialize error must be a string at line one column one column two yeah so it exited that doesn't make any sense oh you gotta escape out of it okay that's what i forgot okay all right we're getting there all right so what you do is you escape out with the backslash before the in inner ones so that's the json serializing uh it's so complicated hey there we go okay so we got the

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Quadrant is a tiny, open-source search engine that runs on Docker. It is designed to be easily integrated into other software systems.

In this video, David Shapiro demonstrates how to install and run Quadrant. He also shows how to create a search index and query it.

Installing Quadrant is simple. First, you need to install Docker Desktop. Then, you can pull the Quadrant image from Docker Hub.

Once Quadrant is up and running, you can create a search index and query it using curl.
