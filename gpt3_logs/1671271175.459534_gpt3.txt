0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:33:36.960,0:33:45.840
okay I'm confronted with with a issue and I must
write out my um so instead of concerns I must
0:33:45.840,0:34:00.180
um brainstorm ideas um about uh Creative Solutions
to the problem um the goal is to discover
0:34:01.740,0:34:10.620
um let's see discover um let's see I guess areas
0:34:11.580,0:34:25.740
um where um or let's see discover compromises that
uh can satisfy everyone's needs so the goal with
0:34:25.740,0:34:31.320
consensus is uh not to make everyone happy but to
get to a place where where you find something that
0:34:31.320,0:34:39.300
that everyone can live with okay so detailed essay
um we'll say let's see detailed brainstorm on
0:34:41.340,0:34:48.600
creative compromises and so in a formal
system if something like this were to be
0:34:48.600,0:34:54.360
implemented for helping guide politics
or God forbid to replace politicians
0:34:55.380,0:35:03.180
um generating ideas is is a whole other process so
consensus is broken into several steps and we're
0:35:03.180,0:35:07.380
kind of making a shorthand but again this video
is getting long and I just want to get at least
0:35:07.380,0:35:11.940
this far so that you see where I'm going with
it and then once we can I'll probably work on
0:35:11.940,0:35:16.620
this a little bit behind the scenes and once
we can reliably generate realistic opinions
0:35:16.620,0:35:21.480
for you know an arbitrary number of people
you know I'm only doing 10. but the idea
0:35:21.480,0:35:25.980
here is let's let's come up with a system
that allows us to find find compromise and
0:35:25.980,0:35:33.360
consensus with 10 billion people that's my
goal um okay I never think big um let's see
0:35:35.700,0:35:41.280
okay so some some things is we could negotiate
another option would be a set set up safe legal
0:35:41.280,0:35:46.920
and affordable abortion services in other
countries um therefore would still be able
0:35:46.920,0:35:50.940
to access them even if they're abandoned my own
country so kind of thinking of a contingency plan
0:35:50.940,0:35:56.880
we could also try and educate the public on this
importance and safety okay and finally we could
0:35:56.880,0:36:05.160
set up underground networks of safe and affordable
abortions going rogue I love it okay so we take
0:36:05.160,0:36:12.600
all of these these different aspects of someone's
world view let's save this as a as a thing um
0:36:16.320,0:36:19.500
because you know what if someone is opposed to
abortion and they don't know what's happening
0:36:19.500,0:36:27.060
does it really hurt them no I shouldn't think
this way um but part of the part of the thing
0:36:27.060,0:36:32.220
about consensus is If This Were Ever to be
implemented as a government system anonymity
0:36:32.220,0:36:37.740
would be very important because like you might be
talking about an issue that is currently illegal
0:36:37.740,0:36:43.260
so say for instance like I don't smoke pot but
I believe that that it should be fully legal
0:36:43.260,0:36:49.380
because all the science indicates that marijuana
is less dangerous than alcohol in many respects
0:36:50.340,0:36:56.580
um and I want to in order to have a safe effective
conversation I need to trust that like if I were
0:36:56.580,0:37:01.020
to have a conversation with a machine or give
my opinions to a machine that's gonna you
0:37:01.020,0:37:05.820
know churn and crank out that that data is not
going to be used against me later because you
0:37:05.820,0:37:12.000
know authoritarian regimes not not just do that
presently but have done that forever is any public
0:37:12.000,0:37:18.360
records about someone can be used against them
this was a huge thing during the Holocaust was
0:37:18.360,0:37:27.660
stuff as simple as Library records land records
Deeds were used to root out undesirable people in
0:37:27.660,0:37:34.680
um in Nazi Germany I'm so glad that I demonetized
my own video because I'm talking about like rape
0:37:34.680,0:37:39.780
and Nazi Germany and stuff and like I totally
get demonetized at this point but you know what
0:37:39.780,0:37:45.660
this is science and we can't be afraid of
taboo topics um so then we'll say topic and
0:37:45.660,0:37:52.920
we'll say compromise Okay so we've got three
aspects of of some of the conversations that
0:37:52.920,0:37:57.780
you need to have for consensus and obviously
this is just basic prompt engineering this is
0:37:58.320,0:38:03.960
in order to do this right we would need to
collect you know hundreds thousands tens of
0:38:03.960,0:38:11.220
thousands of these discussions from real people
to get real human examples um fortunately though
