The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you what you don't need to see me do some baseline coding let me pause the video i'll get just kind of the basics going and then we'll resume the video and we're back i've written the script mostly i scraped together stuff from previous work again i recycle code no big deal there nothing surprising but let's go through it so that you can see this function so when i say like this is the whole inner loop you can see every bit that goes into it and then we'll get into some prompt engineering okay so at the very top um whoops save memory um exactly what it says on the on the tin it just saves you i pass it some some text and a label and it'll save it out to the nexus folder which will look very similar to uh to the to the memories folder here where you see it's got the timestamp prepended and then kind of a little tag just that way it's human readable to see like okay this is what it's about um there's a few advantages to this but mostly so there's a reason for this very early on in my research um i thought about like okay what goes into a memory or a thought or an idea and generally speaking there's a temporal component like if if i say like hey when was the last time you thought about walt disney world right your brain says oh it was around this other time you know so all of our memories are relative um we we have to kind of reverse engineer like okay how long ago was that but with computers we have the advantage of using timestamps and so all things that happen around that time are all going to be interrelated and so we can take a shortcut by using time stamps so we can say okay if you see hear and think something all at the same time they're all going to be related so like the input and output that happens in serial those are all interrelated whereas if you scroll down and say like okay well this output happened you know 3 600 seconds later that's an hour later so it's less likely to be relevant but also it allows you to rebuild a series of events later on so all the memories are going to be saved in sequential order like that so that's the first one and then second one is get timestamp which you just pass it a file name and it returns the actual timestamp i just wrote that as a quick function it's a quick reusable function not a big deal tempo so i use tempo to to basically say how fast this cognitive entity is thinking because if you remove this it thinks many many many times faster than a human can think so when i say like agi is closer than anyone realizes this is what i mean i have to artificially slow this down um so that way it can like even even if it's if it rests 30 seconds between loops it still thinks faster than you or i can um so imagine how much faster it gets if it if it can run multiple loops a second um or how much more powerful it can be uh yeah so i i hope that this video is kind of blowing some some minds and if it's not yet it will okay dossier list so i'm going to probably change this once we get to this but basically this is the list of cognitive tasks that are going to happen in every loop and the big insight that i've had is about how to do cognitive control also let me make sure that you can hear me or that i'm not blowing you up um okay i'm talking pretty loud and clear how's this uh okay that sounds like it's saturating sorry i tend to project a lot um i want to make sure you can hear me okay so basically this will be the list of of cognitive tasks that and some of them are our cognitive tasks that we wanted to do every single time so the insight here that i had is asking questions like what am i doing what should i be doing and what does this mean those those three questions need to be asked every single time and so for people with executive dysfunction their brain isn't asking that question what am i doing what should i be doing you know is this the right thing to do so basically what we're going to do in order to enact cognitive control those are going to be the first questions that this asks and then later on further down the stack once we get all the base all the boilerplate stuff then what we're going to do and i probably won't get this far in this video so to stay tuned but then what we're going to do is we're going to ask gpt3 to generate the next cognitive tasks so that's called a meta prompt where basically you use a gpt3 prompt or a fine-tuned model to generate a prompt for the future i've done this before with the core objective functions i think i've got it yeah i think it was my last experiment with the core objective functions so basically what i did was i broke it into three three parts so a meta prompt is basically where you say like okay i'm going to take the output from one prompt and use it to generate the input for the next prompt so what i did here was in order to enact core objective function three which is increase understanding um i wrote a prompt that i just you give it any particular scenario and gpt3 will generate a list of queries so let me show you how that works so write a list of internet search queries that might help gain relevant information for the following passage um and then for that let me go into let me just grab an older um we'll do a medical text let's find a smaller one come on i want one that's like one kilobyte there we go okay so this is what i mean by a meta prompt so i just say user rights shoulder pane blah blah blah list of internet search queries and davinci text of nco2 the instruct series is really great at this so basically it says like um okay what should i uh what should i ask okay so then if we go back to core objective functions and then we go to core objective function 3b answer the follow internet search queries as a detailed paragraph because provide specific information data and examples so this works because gpt3 already knows a lot so it it is its own source of knowledge all you have to do is get it out and so the first step is what questions should i ask and then it generates its own questions

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to effectively understand and remember something, we need to ask ourselves three key questions: what are we doing, what should we be doing, and what does this mean? These questions help to establish what is relevant and what is not, allowing us to prioritize and focus on the most important information.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, one of the key challenges is how to get the AI to ask these sorts of questions itself. This is where the concept of a "meta prompt" comes in. A meta prompt is a prompt that is generated by another AI, which in turn is used to generate the input for the next prompt.

For example, let's say we have a passage of text that we want to understand. We can use a meta prompt to generate a list of questions that we can then use to search for relevant information. Once we have the answers to these questions, we can then use them to write a detailed paragraph explaining what we've learned.

This system of using AI to generate questions and then use those questions to generate more AI-based questions can be used to effectively create a powerful feedback loop of learning. It is an efficient way to get AI to not only understand complex concepts but also to improve its own understanding over time.
