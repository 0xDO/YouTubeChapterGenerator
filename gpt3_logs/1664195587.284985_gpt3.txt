The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: just so that you can see that it'll it'll it'll stick three arguments together um okay so cd gpt3 critical critical argument python critical argument dot pi well that was fast something is amiss did it generate an output no hold on hold the phone i bet i did something wrong i wonder i wonder if my um i wonder if that was it um print prompt files am i not getting anything hmm i have done something wrong duplicate i know i've fat fingered the syntax somewhere so let's just say os dot lister and then we'll add an exit right after that just okay yep okay so lister works oh wait hey there we go okay just lister with nothingness with no arguments that's how you uh that's what i did i is not defined what do you mean i is not defined oh derp i instantiated it here this is i so typically here's here's what i did wrong typically um for shorthand is you'll say you'll use i in a in an iterative iterable um variable in python so it's for i an iterable thing um and then i copy that instead of switching it to file um sometimes you sometimes you'd be like for i and prompt files um that's bad practice though because if you reuse the same variable name over and over again i've run i've run afoul of that before okay figured it out that's what i did wrong so let's see what it generates no such file or directory ah darn it i forgot to create my gbt3 logs always something gpt-3 logs third or fourth time's a charm okay and then what we'll do is i'll post this back on the forum and see what she says okay so now we've got the um now we've got the output populated reload it yes okay so it's only 2 000 characters long but that's not so bad um anna mills argues that illegal immigration is not unethical um migrants with edmonton respect okay didn't use the the title in this one though um all right so i some some stuff is starting to crystallize in my head um let me make sure i get a copy of the original instructions and ideally what we would do is actually have gpt3 generate the prompts that it needs so that is going to be a big thing in the future with artificial cognition is what's called cognitive control but we'll get into that at another time um okay so let's change this we're going to write the opening okay right the um let's see ah no oh this is a tough one oh oh oh okay i know what i should do i'm gonna pause it for a second because i need to do a little bit of tinkering okay we're back um this video i realized probably seems like it's a little bit rambling and unfocused and i'm taking a risk here because this is not a problem that i've thought about a lot and i just went in cold so i'm showing you my whole process of like okay let me take kind of initial stab at it and see what happens and then we kind of pull it apart and then go at it again so what i've done is rather than me design the argument i'm asking gpt3 now to design the argument so what i've done is i've written a prompt that says read the following argument and brainstorm the outline of a critical assessment write a thorough list of the key points in the essay with some critical evaluation of each focus on constructing a thorough evaluation and deconstruction of the argument presented below um so then i said thorough brainstorm outline points um yeah so that's that you know just let's see let's take thorough outline of points um and i've ran i've run this a couple times and it's pretty consistent um there we go oh much better okay so then what we do so this is this is cognitive control so what we're doing is we're asking first for gpthree to plan its argument um let's run this one more time just to be sure um this is writing first person okay i don't like how it did that we can also increase the maximum length um let's see let's say um describe the points in your own words um yeah there we go the author argues okay all right cool so let's copy this this will be our new first prompt let's just nuke this one and i know some of you will be like ah no save the thing essay thorough outline of points okay so this will be prompt01 and then prompto2 we will keep we will keep some of the original instructions um and so then we will but but but what we will do is we will ask to focus on a specific point okay write a thorough summary and critical assessment of the argument the summary should describe the key ideas we've already got that the summary should focus on the following let's see point and so then we'll do point and so what we'll do is we'll we'll copy paste the output one of these items so she poses the question of whether or not illegal immigration is actually wrong or unethical um and so then we'll say uh let's see we'll put this in quotes that should be fine let's see your assessment of the argument um your assessment of let's say of this point of this point should and we'll go down to here um discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the argument what was compelling persuasive troubling unclear problematic choose phrases like throughout to show the writer's purpose write mostly essay in your own words but consider using the occasional quote there we go and then we can remove the introductory paragraph um actually i think we need to bring that back so this will actually be like yes okay i know i'm jumping all over the place and i promise there is method to my madness um and i'm gonna give these better better names um okay so we'll start this with essay and then we'll do we'll go back to kind of what i originally had which was um i think it was something like critical assessment and evaluation thorough okay that's probably good enough okay so this this will be prompt um intro and this one we're gonna rename to prompt brainstorm so that way i can tell what the heck it's doing um prompt brainstorm and then no don't keep it in the editor this one is going to be um each point so prompt point whoops i've already got it open that's fine close all those prompt point and then we probably need a conclusion let's let's not get ahead of ourselves because

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I attempt to generate an outline for a critical assessment of an argument using GPT-3. I first write a prompt asking GPT-3 to brainstorm an outline of points for me. I then take one of the points generated and ask GPT-3 to write a thorough summary and critical assessment of that point. I finish by asking GPT-3 to write a conclusion for the essay.
