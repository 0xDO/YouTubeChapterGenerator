0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:50:28.980,0:50:35.760
output or if you disagree that's um I'm curious
to how like how would you define the output of
0:50:35.760,0:50:41.400
the town now I guess that the metaphor the way I
understand because I'm just in part of it tml is
0:50:41.400,0:50:46.020
the assembler of the old Endeavor so there is
this these high level languages like what this
0:50:46.020,0:50:52.080
could be the control natural language but or the
Tau language itself then then is executed over tml
0:50:52.620,0:50:58.440
so it's uh it can be understood as such you can
do whatever you want of course it's very low
0:50:58.440,0:51:04.440
level so the thing that you can do in tml have
to be very specific and again it is guaranteed
0:51:04.440,0:51:09.840
that whatever it does it does it correctly
but it's it's too fine grained right somehow
0:51:10.800,0:51:17.280
then tau is a much more abstract language and
it's much closer to the cognition of people
0:51:17.280,0:51:23.040
using them so they are the notion of Concepts and
relations and then and Transitions and programs
0:51:23.820,0:51:31.620
so that you can actually express your your
consonant software in the tower that then will be
0:51:31.620,0:51:36.420
compiled into email that's my understanding but
probably oh and there's a better way to say it
0:51:37.860,0:51:44.160
yeah well The Tao language is also very low level
yes okay but it's more idea to make it I guess
0:51:45.600,0:51:52.860
even more yes yeah the layer to convert from
control natural language or natural language
0:51:53.580,0:52:03.000
to the Tau language that would be a different
layer but our language had to overcome the
0:52:03.000,0:52:08.820
theoretical difficulties of speaking about
rules of sentences in the same language and
0:52:08.820,0:52:12.420
having the temporal Dimension to allow
it to be sort of specification language
0:52:13.500,0:52:17.160
and it achieves this in a mathematical
way if you see that our language
0:52:18.480,0:52:23.400
it will make little sense to you
because it is a mathematical thing
0:52:24.480,0:52:29.220
but you can build on top of it
something that relates to real life
0:52:33.720,0:52:39.540
so by building what I guess uh can you
expand on that like building building
0:52:39.540,0:52:44.280
something on top of the Tau language the town
metal language um how does that how does that
0:52:44.280,0:52:50.880
connect to the original purpose of Tau which
was that collaboration the consensus and the
0:52:50.880,0:52:56.220
construction of software in a decentralized
manner because this is this is the the underlying
0:52:57.180,0:53:00.480
um I don't want to say operating system because
it's it's different but it's the underpinning
0:53:00.480,0:53:08.880
technology that facilitates that correct that goal
of distributed software development yes but there
0:53:08.880,0:53:14.280
is one important point to understand here which
is the difference between code and specification
0:53:18.000,0:53:25.860
to give an example suppose you you're
a new city you want to reach from point
0:53:25.860,0:53:30.000
A to point B and you don't know how
to how to do that so you ask someone
0:53:31.380,0:53:40.020
and I tell you you go straight third turn to
the right second third turn to the left and
0:53:40.020,0:53:45.600
so on they don't tell you how many meters but I
tell you the second third first term and so on
0:53:46.860,0:53:51.960
and and you ask another one and they
give you completely different directions
0:53:53.280,0:53:58.680
that hopefully lead to the same place
how can you compare and make sure that
0:53:58.680,0:54:05.280
those two sets of instructions lead you to
the same place well you cannot you cannot
0:54:09.120,0:54:16.080
at the same way it is impossible to say that
whether two programs are equivalent as we spoke
0:54:16.080,0:54:21.420
before and programs are indeed instructions
where the computer has to turn at each moment
0:54:23.700,0:54:24.200
foreign
0:54:27.780,0:54:35.640
specification the requirements level of different
nature your requirement is to age 1.8 to 0.3
0:54:37.680,0:54:43.080
and this is not written in the language
of instructions you will need eventually
0:54:43.080,0:54:46.860
to get the instructions but
that's not what you really want
0:54:49.320,0:54:56.400
software is still in the Stone Age In This sense
you'll need to call the instructions why can't you
