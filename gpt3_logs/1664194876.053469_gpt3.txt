The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: go out to do outside of work i don't know how to meet new people or make new friends see here by investigating we're getting at the underlying problem eve says that's understandable it can be tough to break out of your comfort zone but it sounds like you're ready for a change see how positive and encouraging this is okay we don't have to go through all of these let me just close some of these and i'll show you what else i've done um to do close a lot of i guess i shouldn't have opened all of them um okay so i have copied a few more things in so we've got um our format training data uh so we what we did what we just did was run synthesize convos now we've got format training data let me open this so i can show you what it does it's pretty simple all it does is use json to create a file called eve.jsonl it does a little bit of cleanup honestly i just copy pasted this from my last project so let's call this convos okay so python format okay and i have a little bit of debug output i guess so now there should be eve dot json l there we go so here's our here's our here's our training data um you can see it's 209 000 characters long 239 lines so that's 239 samples i did add a couple of um topics so let me show you um the reason that i the reason i do things in loops is because it's like oh wait i just thought of something i wanted to add so i added um dinosaurs roman history and struggling with calculus at the end so if you go back into the convos and sort by name so you see that there's um there's a couple of instances where we want to talk about dinosaurs so user says hey eve i've been feeling down lately i think i need some help hey there so are you feeling down can you tell me what's going on um this is interesting how did that happen do you like animals i love animals hmm i wonder what happened here because this is clearly like the wrong topic okay well it's still a good conversation um it's like they got misnamed or something hmm interesting i think i broke it this is the one this is the one that i that i first looked so hey eve i'm really interested in dinosaurs do you know anything about them yes i certainly do so this is a good way to um to show that like this thing could could handle education um and then the one for roman history was really good um roman history do you have any tips on where to start absolutely the history and the decline of the fall of the roman empire by edward gibbon i wonder if that's a real book let's check that out real quick yep it certainly is so in this case because this is an information companion you want it to actually help with real books so that's cool um that's great there was another one where let's see roman history is one of my favorite topics again eve doesn't have personhood so we don't want to do that but that's fine largest empires in world history it was the most powerful force in the western world the roman empire was founded in 27 bc by augustus caesar the first roman emperor is that right i would have thought that that would have been julius caesar okay well maybe i learned something it also we didn't we didn't provide any training data about rome or this particular topic but the point remains that you could create you could easily create a chat bot that is um domain specific for education um let's see here's another one for rome roman history is fascinating topics there are many ways to to approach it the roman republic time of great change for rome the republic was founded in 509 bc and lasted until the end of the roman empire and 476 a.d that sounds about right okay so let's see we're done with that part we've got the fine tuning data oh yeah let's just go ahead and kick off the fine tuning um okay so cls i did create or i copied over my um my fine tuning script i changed a couple things so let's go down here so eve.jsonl that's the file that's this one we're going to upload we're going to get the response id the tag is going to be information companion and the base model is going to be curie curie is usually powerful enough to do to do chat bots especially if you fine-tune them chatting is not a particularly complex thing however the other reason i'm doing this is also just cost because it'll cost like a dollar fifty to fine tune this rather than fifteen dollars and i don't wanna break the bank so i will go ahead and kick off the fine tuning because we're almost done and then when we come back i will show you the final result and we're back we're all done the fine tune model is has completed i did it with curie so it's a little bit uh it's not quite as bright it can still go off the rails but i just wanted to show an example so let's imagine that we are a little kid you know little kids love dinosaurs and they always want to know what the biggest dinosaur is so first things first you do need to make sure that you have user and eve as stops on here otherwise it'll start just imagining its own conversations um so let's see user uh let's see so i got the conversation started while we're offline sure dinosaurs are extinct but they used to be really popular popular that's an interesting turn of phrase they used to exist people used to collect dinosaur bones and they're often used in religious ceremonies that's true there are even dinosaur theme parks that's thinking of jurassic park uh let's see what are the biggest dinosaurs there are a lot of dinosaurs and they all have different sizes and shapes were really big like the sauropods which were really big long-necked dinosaurs some were small like the ornith or the the ornithopods the birds which were small bipedal dinosaurs there were also lots of different kinds of dinosaurs like ceratopsians which were horns dinosaurs that's cool um let's see what would what would an eight-year-old ask um could a dinosaur eat my car eve wow that's a really long response i'm not sure dinosaurs are extinct so it's possible that a dinosaur could eat your car but it probably would be more of a break in a

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Dinosaurs are a fascinating topic for many people, especially kids. They are often curious about what the biggest dinosaur is, or if a dinosaur could eat their car. While dinosaurs are extinct, it is still possible to learn about them through books, movies, and even theme parks.
