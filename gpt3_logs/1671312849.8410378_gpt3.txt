0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:08:05.880,0:08:13.020
um actually no let's let's keep that because
it it's a helpful demarcation so I added this
0:08:13.020,0:08:17.280
little token because when you read a PDF you
have to read it Page by Page and sometimes
0:08:17.280,0:08:21.420
sometimes knowing where there's a page break
um is helpful so we'll keep that that's fine
0:08:21.420,0:08:27.360
all right so let's come back to converted
we'll copy this and bring it back over to
0:08:28.500,0:08:36.300
um do opinions Dot underscore text and
we'll paste it there all right so I'm
0:08:36.300,0:08:38.880
going to download a bunch of these I'm going
to pause the video you don't need to watch me
0:08:38.880,0:08:43.080
downloading it but this is what I'm going to do
so I'm gonna get like I'm not going to spend the
0:08:43.080,0:08:47.280
time to download all 300 I'll sort them by
like most popular whatever and we'll have a
0:08:47.280,0:08:51.900
whole bunch of Supreme Court case law about what
was this Anti-Trust yeah so we'll be right back
0:08:53.880,0:09:00.540
Okay I uh downloaded files until I got rate
limited so be kind to your data sources and
0:09:00.540,0:09:07.020
don't abuse them um many websites will do this if
they detect that you are uh scraping or whatever
0:09:07.800,0:09:11.220
um if they don't offer a bulk download
there's there's probably a reason for it
0:09:12.180,0:09:16.560
um but anyways it didn't give me a warning
that I had violated any any terms of service
0:09:16.560,0:09:22.200
that just said we see that you're you're you
know we're rate limiting you um it didn't
0:09:22.200,0:09:27.000
say that there was any consequences just were
temporarily rate limiting you so that's fine
0:09:28.080,0:09:33.360
um I mean this is all public information anyways
it's from the Library of Congress so I think it's
0:09:33.360,0:09:38.160
more of a technical thing so anyways what I'm
doing here is I'm converting it all to text
0:09:39.660,0:09:47.520
um so let's go to converted excuse me delete
the ones that we don't need and this is uh you
0:09:47.520,0:09:52.680
know this is infinitely more case law than
I ever want to read I mean I'm not going to
0:09:52.680,0:10:00.600
read one of them let alone 22 of them so let's
go ahead and copy these over to my repo here
0:10:01.500,0:10:09.240
I'm gonna go ahead and replace that one okay
so now we have 1.7 megabytes of case law of
0:10:09.240,0:10:15.720
Anti-Trust case law this goes back to the late 80s
so this should be if we understand this if we do a
0:10:15.720,0:10:23.160
model as if we if we do something that understands
this and we should have the ability to interact
0:10:23.160,0:10:30.480
with a machine that can explain the current common
law of antitrust for America hey who knows maybe
0:10:30.480,0:10:35.280
legal eagle will watch this and uh want to do
a collaboration or comment on how accurate it
0:10:35.280,0:10:41.160
is that would be cool um someone what's his
name Devin someone please watch this and uh
0:10:41.160,0:10:48.060
and get Devin to check it out and comment on one
my accuracy but also the value of this tool okay
0:10:48.900,0:10:55.080
so what do we do next well there's so here's
the thing the token the biggest limitation
0:10:55.080,0:11:02.340
is the token limit of large language models
so it's this weird Paradox right where the
0:11:02.340,0:11:05.100
model itself I don't remember how big
they are they're many gigabytes right
0:11:05.880,0:11:11.280
um I think gpt3 is like 700 gigabytes of
vram is how much it takes it's enormous
0:11:11.280,0:11:17.340
right so but despite how big it is that isn't
it can't it can't take in that much information
0:11:18.360,0:11:22.800
um it takes it's like it's like blowing
information in through a straw right same thing
0:11:22.800,0:11:28.920
with your brain right like your brain has you know
it's three pounds of neurons 100 billion neurons 7
0:11:28.920,0:11:35.100
000 synaptic connections per neuron um but you
can only speak at a few bytes per second right
0:11:35.100,0:11:40.140
the your input and output rate is very slow
compared to the processing power of your brain
0:11:41.280,0:11:46.920
um and and the amount of information in it
right so the the the the UI the API is very slow
0:11:47.580,0:11:53.520
same thing is true of of deep of of
gpt3 and all language models right now
0:11:54.600,0:11:59.520
um so not only that they have a very short memory
they can only remember what you do one task at
0:11:59.520,0:12:08.400
a time so you can it can't it cannot it is not
possible for the machine to be able to tell us
