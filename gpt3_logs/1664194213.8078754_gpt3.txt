The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: description in the setting um okay this is this is copying it too much i don't want it to just like call each thing out um it's what it's probably doing here is copying the style of reddit where you would quote something and respond to it directly we don't want that style though so we're gonna we're gonna hold this one open because we're gonna change that the treaty was a fragile one yep and this is just repeating the story back to us this one is the story he wrote again so this is also the quoting thing positive i like the opening yep okay so we don't want this this file um the complement sandwich that's fine so we'll just delete this say the opening paragraph is very evocative it sets the scene well overall this is a strong story but with a few revisions it could be even better opening scene is very effective okay opening paragraph is well written in general okay i don't like the format of this one i guess we can close this since this is good that's right i need to close them if they're if they're if they're correct um your opening paragraph is good overall interesting characters so basically what i'm going to do is i'm just going to keep the ones that need to be repeated keep them open that one's good and that one's good okay so we've got one two three four five six seven that aren't good so when you have this much data you often don't need to fix them you just delete the bad ones um so what i'll do is i'll wait for this to be completely finished um if we're at 107 out of out of 388 let's see let's see how much this is costing because some of you have questions about token cost so each of these completions um 25 cents 20 cents 22 [Music] 36 this is actually going to be pretty expensive okay that's fine how much am i at already ow oh this is going to be a really expensive job this is why i was waiting so i started this project um a while ago and um and i was like i'm about out of tokens for the uh for the month so i'm gonna wait till june so we're on june 1st and um yeah i'm i'm vernon tokens so they're on average this is about the first what is that um 90 or so so 90 cost 6.23 cents so 388 divided by 90 times six dollars and 23 cents so this is going to be 27 just to generate the fine tuning data um this is another reason why i truncated it on length um is because it's like i don't want to spend that much money um but it'll be good we'll get good results this way also let's see a um a 1.2 megabyte fine-tuning job was like 40 this is probably going to be bigger so this is going to hurt how much is this already oh that's not so bad okay maybe this will be a smaller fine-tuning job the uh the um novel writing one was killer because there was there was um 200 samples and each prompt was really long let me show you how big that was um auto muse so the um the data here 1.1.3 megabytes um so it's total 1.3 megabytes that was on let's see 523 was when it was last edited so let's go to june and i can show you how much that was um because i know they're just doing this while while it's running and answering questions that you guys have had um let's see 523 come on let that load let's see how much do we have now um may may 23 fine-tuning one request so the novel rider at 1.3 megabytes was a 38.61 fine-tuned job um so that's just so that you you know like how much this costs so um if uh let's see let's see what how much data we're at right now for the creative writing coach so we're 128 items and that is um the size is 115 kilobytes okay so that's like roughly a third so let's see how many how many files did i 128 okay so 388 divided by 128 so yeah almost exactly a third times 115 kilobytes so that'll be 348 kilobytes total if it averages out um so and then uh let's see this one was um it was like 1300 kilobytes so 1300 um actually no crap uh 348 divided by 1300 so this is just over a quarter of the size so we s we multiply that then by what was it and 38.61 cents so we'll expect this fine-tuned job to be about 10 so generating the the um the training data is very expensive but hopefully the fine-tune job will be much cheaper i could be wrong about all this we'll see how it turns out anyways we're about a third of the way done so i'll go ahead and pause the video again um do a quick refresh yeah so you see how there there haven't been any there haven't been too many more additional large um large uh completions yep you have a great imagination good i don't like that one i don't like that one yeah so all right so what we'll do is um some of these some of these are salvageable we just need to clean them up a little bit but then once we do that we'll delete the ones that we don't like just because again we've got a plethora of data if if something's not good just delete it because we want to have that consistency one thing that happens with fine tuning is that you can you can kind of smooth out rough edges because it'll take the average like if you have a handful of aberrations in the fine tuning data it's okay um which is why i often don't check the fine tuning data but in this case i wanna um just show you like this is one thing you can do to clean it up to get more consistent responses okay i'm gonna pause the video now and we'll um we'll be back in just a second okay we're back um i chickened out because this was getting expensive but we do have 202 completions i've already taken the liberty of deleting the ones that were too big too long or didn't follow the correct format so this is one example of so because you know if you're an expert in fine tuning or if you're familiar you might be like dave if you're just going to find if you're going to use one prompt to generate all of your data what's the point of fine tuning the point of fine tuning is that you can look for those aberrations and remove them and clean up the formatting so that you'll because the purpose of fine tuning is to get very consistent results fine tuning usually reduces creativity but it increases consistency um and so it's

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Treaty was a fragile one, and this story is a perfect example of that. The opening paragraph is very evocative and sets the scene well. Overall, this is a strong story, but with a few revisions, it could be even better. The opening scene is very effective and the opening paragraph is well written in general. However, the format of this story could be improved. Additionally, the characters are interesting and the story is overall well-written. To improve the story, I recommend deleting the quotes and responses to them, as well as fixing the formatting. Doing so will make the story more consistent and easier to read.
