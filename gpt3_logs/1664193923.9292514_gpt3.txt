The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: doubt it'll work but i think it'll be a cool experiment all right i'm gonna pause the video because this is a lot of tweaking and stuff and also i'm recording at 60fps which means it will um it'll blow up the file size and i don't care i don't care to do that so i'm going to pause the recording and come back when i've got this split up i'm just going to write a couple scripts that'll basically do this data prep and then i'll be right back okay we're back prematurely because i realize there's something else that i'm doing that you'd probably benefit from seeing um i use gpth3 to give me a summary or the the outline um because i don't want to write an outline for these and also i haven't read them all and just so shoot shoot me sue me um okay so here's the file of frankenstein the story and then here's the outline so then this is all going to be broken down and summarized so let me just show you the prompt right the full detailed outline of the book alice in wonderland i put the um let's put this up to a thousand i know 500 tokens if it's longer than that it might not fit in the fine tuning data okay so then introduction that doesn't help detailed outline buddy detailed there we go hmm i don't like this we want you to give me a long write the long full detailed outline of the book alice in wonderland it seems like it is trying to shortchange me unacceptable machine unacceptable realizes it was all just a dream um this worked for frankenstein it's not working for this one so that means we have to do some prompt engineering uh let's see come on brain we want not just an outlined um let's try synopsis synopsis is a good word there we go um let's see uh let's see list every scene ah so this is like gpt3 has the information i'm just trying to like get it out of it that's one of the most like frustrating things is the information is in there this looks a little bit better okay cool or she wakes her up from her dream okay i don't think this is sufficient but you know blah blah it tells us most of the story okay so go save this and this will be outlines alice in wonderland okay you've seen the process i'm going to do this for all five books just that way we have a a summary or outline or synopsis to feed in so that that way the the auto muse generator knows where the story is going all right i'm gonna pause the video again and we'll come back once i've done some scripting okay i've got the first script uh well started i just want to show you what it does um so that you understand um as we go uh this is a really short thing i had to find this module but it's just called text wrap and what it does is it splits splits strings and python into whatever size chunk you want so what i do is i open open the book just as a text as a string and then i break it into 1500 character chunks and the output so far looks like this so i just run book to chunks and it says alice in wonderland.text 110 chunks frankenstein 293 great gatsby 194 pride and prejudice 518 is a long story sherlock 389 okay so we'll have a bunch of sequential chunks in order to play with this excuse me um yeah so we're off to a good start these chunks for reference they're gonna go here so basically the um the the outline which was already generated let me show you the outlines um so the outlines are here so we've got an outline for each of these that'll go up at the top so the story outlines so every every time you input this um gpt3 because here's the thing gpt3 has no long-term memory everything that it needs to know has to be in every single input this is where human brains are far superior to gpt3 so neuroscience lesson time if you look at like you know if you ever google like how much working memory does the human brain have it'll you'll get a some idiotic answer like oh the human brain can only hold seven things in it you know in short-term working memory that is patently absurd um any writer will laugh at that idea because when you're writing you have to remember all the lore from the story you're writing if it's a sequel you have to remember all the lore from the previous one um all the characters the character voices language stuff now is that something that you're holding in your in your memory and you're manipulating no so technically i guess you could say it's not in your working memory but it is in your recall so there's a difference between working memory and recall so gpt3 which can just recall stuff off the bat right off the cuff so if you go here um close some of those um this is what you might call recall gpt3 has been trained to just instantly recall a whole bunch of facts now if you're writing a brand new story it doesn't have that right it has no recall because you can just ask like you know you can ask it about the adventures of sherlock holmes and gpt3 can spit out usually a good answer the reason is because it's got recall however it does not it does not have the ability to recall something that it was never trained on so you have to handle the recall manually this is where all my work on on artificial cognition comes in because everything that you need it to know everything for any given situation has to be put into this corpus this input so these um these summaries these outlines that's got to go in because this because gpt3 needs to know where the story's going um let's see uh where it was there we go um and so then you need a say like okay where are we in the story um because if you just give it an outline and a paragraph like you if you are familiar with a story then you can read a paragraph and kind of figure out where you are if however you are not familiar with a story uh or it's a news story and you just grab a random paragraph you're not going to know where you are and gpt 3 is not magic right it's just it's modeling human writing that's all it's doing so if you just give it a random paragraph it's going to be lost it's just going to guess where it is in the story so that means we also need this in in what's

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to generate a coherent story, the AI must be given a clear prompt, a detailed outline of the story, and information about where the story is in the current moment. This can be done by feeding the AI a synopsis of the story, or by providing a detailed outline that includes information about each scene.
