TRANSCRIPT: when we've succeeded and the short answer is once it understands more than we do and not only can it understand but it also needs to be self-improving and self-correcting and so these core objective functions are one how it is self-improving and self-correcting um from the above uh that should be fine okay so let's see what it says um let's see as the definition of understanding suggests one way to increase understanding in this situation is to learn more about ecology and climate change this can be done by reading books articles and other materials on the subject additionally it is important to be curious and ask questions about these topics furthermore it can be helpful to teach others about ecology and climate change in order to help increase understanding of the issues that's pretty good it's it's fairly boilerplate um but if you take this output and feed it into another thing like okay let's explore how to actually achieve this this is still a good direction um so but you know it it already came up with some ideas um actually here let's uh let's see in the above situation um uh let's see identify gaps in understanding and propose methods to alleviate those gaps okay so let's try this it's going to pretty much say the same thing okay so it's still said this can be done by reading books articles and other resources additionally talking to experts in the field can help to increase understanding another way to increase understanding is to be curious and ask questions uh about things that are not fully understood excellent by doing this we can learn more about the situation and find ways to improve it that's a little bit better i like that okay so let's copy this and this will be our prompt for increased understanding um let's see so we'll do context we'll save this as prompt understanding okay so now we've done so this this according to um this helpful commenter zaya um is the hardest thing so i hope this is a satisfactory answer now let's get to the easier parts about cognitive control um okay so back to cognitive control let's see um what's going on what am i doing what should i be doing uh how should i do it um so with these contexts so this is this is where i'm like it's difficult because it's like a chicken or the egg problem is our artificial cognitive entity can't have a sense of self until it actually has behaviors and it doesn't have any behaviors so like what am i doing there's no answer to that question it's not doing anything how should i do it or like what should i be doing okay that is in response to the core objective functions which is fine what should i be thinking about how should i do it but we can start with what's going on so let's say let's start there read the following um uh characterize the following situation um infer what's going on and why the goal is to um let's see just write an insightful evaluation of the situation okay so there's a very there's a few very important verbs here so characterize characterize is a very specific verb that triggers um a few functions within gpt3 so if you characterize something you're just describing it um so it but it's a very it's it's a more scientific term than just describe um so like if you characterize a wound right so like this this wound on my pinky like characterize it okay i would say there's discoloration on the of the fingernail bed there is a superficial um wound at the um uh was it at the distal you know uh finger pad um there's you know tenderness pain and bruising so really all you're just doing is evaluating what you see what's going on without any judgments and then infer so in an inference is um the ability to make inferences is one of the most critical aspects of intelligence and so it's like okay well if i'm going to make inferences about what happened here i would say this looks like a traumatic injury such as perhaps crushing or impact related so that's what i mean by inference and then write an insightful evaluation of the situation so that's just saying like okay load all of this into your head characterize and infer and then write an insightful evaluation of the situation um about this situation so the reason that we do this rather than just copy paste it is because like okay in this case this is like this is already kind of an evaluation um but let's just see what it says and then we'll go back to um the dialog and i'll show you kind of how how a prompt like this really helps um okay causing climate change human needs at odds okay so that's that's nothing new right but let's go back to um dialogue dialog 10 okay so because sometimes what's going on is not necessarily obvious so let's see read the following whoops i'm gonna delete that okay um the situation is that bianca cannot date until her sister cat does cameron is asking her out but she turns them down because of this it is a shame because cat used to be popular in high school but now she is not okay so that is just that's that's that is that is an interpretation of what's going on but also it's a very quick summary of what's going on so we will copy this as one of the prompts so we'll say context and we will call this um prompt um [Music] let's see this is what's going on what's going on yep okay so that should satisfy this part of the of the cognitive control loop we'll have to come back to what am i doing so keeping track of what you're doing this is one of the most critical things of cognitive control because with gpt3 you can easily confuse it by changing tasks very quickly or adding new information it'll kind of forget what it's doing so we need to do is break that cognitive task out separately and say okay what was i doing like okay you know if you've got it if you've got an acog or a machine or a robot that's like helping you make dinner and it's like okay i am helping you make dinner and but if it gets the idea of like i'm gonna go do something else like you don't want it to just stop making dinner in the middle of making dinner you

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It is important for an artificial cognitive entity to have a sense of self in order to be able to engage in cognitive control. In order to have a sense of self, the entity must have behaviors. One way to increase the understanding of an artificial cognitive entity is to have it learn more about ecology and climate change. This can be done by reading books, articles, and other materials on the subject, being curious and asking questions about these topics, and by teaching others about ecology and climate change. Another way to increase the understanding of an artificial cognitive entity is to identify gaps in understanding and propose methods to alleviate those gaps.
