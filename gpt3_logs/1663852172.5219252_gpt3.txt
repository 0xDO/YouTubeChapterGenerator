how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.880,0:00:08.240
hey everyone david shapiro here back with uh auto
muse so uh we've done parts one and two this has
0:00:08.240,0:00:13.600
taken a lot of work um and i've done a little
bit of work um in the background just because i
0:00:13.600,0:00:20.960
didn't wanna bore the audience with um with some
nitty-gritty stuff but let me show you what i've
0:00:20.960,0:00:26.480
done so first i think it'll make sense to let me
just show you what the output is and then we'll
0:00:26.480,0:00:34.240
work backwards just because there's a lot here and
without a guide like a orientation it's not going
0:00:34.240,0:00:41.680
to make a lot of sense okay so there are there's
two folders that have the the kind of like final
0:00:41.680,0:00:48.800
fine-tuned data and it's prompts and completions
and so if you're not familiar with gpt3 yet
0:00:49.680,0:00:53.600
there's a prompt which is the input and then
the completion which is the output input output
0:00:54.480,0:01:02.240
so basically what i've done is all of this goes
to creating an input like this outline dorian
0:01:02.240,0:01:09.120
gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome etc
etc story so far so this is chunk number 23 the
0:01:09.120,0:01:15.120
passage discusses the uselessness of art and how
it is seen as a form of autobiography etc etc so
0:01:15.120,0:01:22.080
this was created by the function called recursive
summarization it needs a lot of work this is this
0:01:22.080,0:01:25.840
is probably not going to work but we're going
to see it through to the end and see how it goes
0:01:27.200,0:01:33.280
so there's the outline which is included in every
input so that way gpt3 knows the whole story
0:01:34.480,0:01:40.320
the story so far so this is a summary of summaries
so basically it's it what this is supposed to
0:01:40.320,0:01:44.960
represent is what has happened in the story so
far you can see here that it's a little bit too
0:01:44.960,0:01:49.600
compacted so we're probably going to need to
change that in the training data that's okay
0:01:50.320,0:01:56.960
um and then the last chunk this is this is the
most recent 1500 characters of prose that was
0:01:56.960,0:02:04.720
written and so then what we ask it to do is write
the next chunk and so we're on dorian gray 23 so
0:02:04.720,0:02:12.640
this is paired with the completion dorian gray
23 so they have the same file name um but so you
