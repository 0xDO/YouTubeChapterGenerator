CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Churches are losing members and religious leaders are struggling to find ways to appeal to the growing number of atheists. This is having a major impact on society.

Spiritual nihilism is on the rise. However, neo-paganism is also on the rise. Maybe we are returning to traditional values. When Jordan Peterson said we should return to traditional values, he was probably referring to Christian values. But what if we go back to older values?

 provide a specific example of political nihilism today.

Okay, I was hoping it would be very specific. Um, anyways, I think that's good enough for now. You get the point. You can talk philosophy with GPT3. It knows more about philosophy than I do. I don't always agree with it, but that could be from my own ignorance.

Anyways, thanks for watching.
