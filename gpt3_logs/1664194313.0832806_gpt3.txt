The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: let's see is it recording i think so yes okay hey everybody david shapiro here we are back after a brief outage um open ai had a uh had a little bit of a glitch with their fine tuning end point it was down for about a day or so um anyways yeah so here we are we are ready to get back in the saddle um all right so about a week ago i made a video about um the tutor education chatbot and in that one all i did was i focused on just teaching topics which gpt3 can do that on its own you can just go and ask it questions on the playground it'll answer them that's not a big deal so there's not much value add there but um in my la in that video i talked about how teachers teachers librarians counselors educators of all types have a really tough job because sometimes often students or pupils or clients or whatever they have problems that are not have nothing to do with learning they might show up and they might be hungry they might be stressed out because of the bad home life or if they live in a poor area there might be crime or whatever it is and um i i've also mentioned that i used to date a teacher and um one of the hardest things that she talked about was getting children to be engaged who um who gave up and see it all the time i read a book called the genius myth by michael mead i think i got that right um where he he worked with um underprivileged children for many many years and uh so his whole thing is you gotta spark that that that genius that's in everyone whatever it is that they're passionate about so before i dive into all the code and the data and stuff i just want to show you what i mean so in this case i'm pretending to be a user who's like a bored kid who doesn't care you know it's all lower case misspelling whatever user i don't know play play video games watch tv okay and so what what you can see here is tim says that sounds like a really tough position to be in i'm curious what do you enjoy doing so this is perfect i included training data that that taught gpt3 to respond this way so it's compassionate listening but it's also curiosity because by investigating so i use that word investigate so an educator is also an investigator um and also a validator right so this is the compassionate part where that's a really tough position to be in that's saying i hear you i hear that this sucks i'm curious though what do you enjoy doing and so you see here where this is this is expert i couldn't perform this well in real life even though i know the technique okay that's a start are there any particular games or shows that you like user um i play call of duty with my i know that i'm like out of date i'm dating myself because i used to play call of duty like 10 years ago um with my friends i don't know what kids are playing these days what is it fortnite or is that one done minecraft um tim let's see oops tim says that sounds like fun what about other games or shows what are your other interests um so here we're gonna pretend like we're super adversarial because this is a kid who's super checked out and you with these mind games let's see what he says tim has short-circuited come on see this is a weird thing yeah it unloaded the model even though i had just been using it let me remove that extra tim um so let's just see what it does and then we'll we'll jump into the code unless it there we go i'm sorry just trying to show you okay here we go here we go perfect perfect i don't know why it's adding that extra tim though um i'm sorry i'm just trying to understand you better i don't mean to be intrusive but it sounds like you're really stuck right now oh man this is perfect so you get this angry rejection and it's like okay well like i think you're stuck right now and i think understanding your interest can be really helpful in figuring out what to do next so please tell me more about things that you like to do that's a little bit too insistent um but like by by by acknowledging you know the the feelings like the one this is demonstrating that gpt3 has theory of mind um but yeah it's also weird that it's doing this double tim thing so anyways um okay i think this is good enough this is this is a strong enough understanding like this is what a professional counselor therapist special ed teacher any good teacher or librarian might do and it has the mission of i'm gonna let's let's figure out what's going on with you okay how did we do this that is why we're here that is the question of the hour um yes here's the day here's the code let me show you um all right tutor chat bot this is the repo it should all be up to date get status get add get commit am um updating that's whatever if i ever criticize someone for bad git messages i'm pretty sure any developer just cringed when they saw a single word commit message um anyways laughing at myself all right back to the real stuff so quick recap there's only three scripts here there's synthesized convos format training data and fine tune so let me close these and we'll just go through them one at a time so the first one is synthesize convos if you watched the last video you saw we i think i don't know if i if i showed you any writing of this but it's pretty pretty basic i've basically just copy pasted it all it does is for i and range 0 through 4 so four iterations it opens topics.text splits the lines and then runs it through the prompt so what does the prompt look like the prompt i've actually had several prompts now so let me show you the first one was this one so in the last video we did some experimentation and settled on this prompt um i also saved this one which is the user is a curious child so they ask many clarified questions and sometimes they don't understand it didn't work that well but i wanted to save it anyways just to show you if you come to this repo later that like you change the context and gpt 3's behavior changes this is the one that i ended up with for making this data oh and the reason why i did all this work and there isn't a
