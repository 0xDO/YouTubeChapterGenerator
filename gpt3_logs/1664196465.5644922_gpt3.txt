The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: ourselves that they fundamentally have a finite sense of self just like us that they think in terms of I and me and this is what I want and this is what I'm going to do so my very next video is going to be an experiment where I I test this I test different agent models can we produce a machine that has a fundamentally different kind of agency or a fundamentally different kind of ego or what I call an agent model so this is an agent model um which is a an information system about the entity um so the information system about the entity what I mean by that is like I know that I am a human with two hands two feet and a brain I generally know what I know and what I'm capable of and I I also generally know what I um what I'm not capable of right like I can't jump over my house um that's part of my agent model um so to make it a little bit more specific a self-referential information system about the entity um so like what kinds of agent models of agent models are possible do they have to be I um anyways so I just wanted to set the stage my very next video will be about testing agent models and seeing how that affects um the way that uh and uh how that affects alignment now before I let you go there is one other thing that I wanted to um wanted to show you and this is this is much more recent so 36 alarming Automation and job statistics our robots and um let's go away machines and AI coming for your job so this is this is a uh more recent and it's from zippya you know take it with a grain of salt um since 2000 at least 2600 or sorry 260 000 jobs have been lost in the and the US due to automation so two percent of the country's manufacturing Workforce and they are only increasing exponentially again take it with a grain of salt automation is also predicted to create 58 million new jobs though automation could eliminate in the result of 73 million jobs so we're at where the the the the the yield curves to borrow a finance term have inverted where yes automation is creating new jobs but it's creating uh Automation and AI ER creating fewer new jobs than it's creating so a net loss of 15 million jobs that's a lot um so uh the reason that I bring this up is because my state of the industry video yesterday um there was an article about how um uh AI art is disrupting that industry and it's not just from an artistic perspective there are countless um uh graphic artists that you know could very soon be facing um job loss or job change and you know if if the net change is that a quarter you know like yes there are some new jobs because now there's going to be new jobs of people like you know content creators and marketers and whoever just using these tools great new jobs but then how many people are going to lose their job in the meantime and if they have like if they're not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change is fewer jobs then that means some people will by definition mathematically be permanently excluded from the job market and so because of that um I went and looked up some statistics just to see like you know is this is this uh true um you know again take it with a grain of salt um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I am very close to writing novel length fiction um that's going to be pretty coherent and then and and there's a few other things that I don't even want to say out loud because um because of these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put novelists or editors out of work um just because you can do something doesn't mean you should and I think about like I would lose all my friends if I did that if I if I created if I created a tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn out novels decent enough novels um all of my best friends are writers and some of them are aspiring to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it then I know that someone else is going to be capable of it um before too long but you know I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the that's the short version I'm going to keep doing it privately um just to see what what is possible um but yeah like I don't want to put people out of work like what's the point right what's why why are we here like I don't I understand that the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is to generate more efficiency provide goods and services um more efficiently but at the same time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful um major economic disruptions are painful like people lose their jobs people lose their homes people go hungry um people forego major life decisions um so like disruption is a euphemism right and um so I realize that I am now in a place where I need to be careful with what I release and it also made me wonder if openai deliberately crippled Dolly so that it does not produce Fine Art Level uh Generations um so that it would be less disruptive I don't know like that's a that's a discussion that they would have had internally and they probably wouldn't have published it but someone did tell me that they deliberately crippled faces and they did it on ostensibly for safety right where eyes and eyes and mouths usually look a little bit weird on Dolly generations and I wonder if they did that not just for safety but out of a sense of Ethics like to to um to like hinder their own tool so that it is less likely to um to displace jobs I don't know I don't know just speculating but that's where I'm at so that's the state of the industry update for this morning thanks for watching like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Since 2000, at least 260,000 jobs have been lost in the US due to automation. This is just a small fraction of the total number of jobs that are predicted to be lost to automation in the coming years. While some new jobs will be created as a result of automation, the net result is expected to be a loss of 15 million jobs.

This is a major economic disruption that will have a profound impact on the lives of many people. I am now in a position where I need to be careful with what I release, as I don't want to contribute to this disruption. I am also wondering if openai deliberately crippled Dolly so that it does not produce Fine Art Level generations, in order to hinder its potential to displace jobs.
