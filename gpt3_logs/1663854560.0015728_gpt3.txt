0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:21:24.060,0:21:31.320
size and then number of parallel I'm going to
do a little bit larger of a batch size based
0:21:31.320,0:21:37.080
on the quick start I think this is an example of
a record so a record is a dictionary that has at
0:21:37.080,0:21:44.280
the top level ID integer and then the vector
it looks like it's just plain um at least at
0:21:44.280,0:21:50.820
least if you use the the Raw One it does it this
way but if you go here and you look at record
0:21:52.620,0:22:00.060
um I think the record has to have
um let's see base record Vector
0:22:00.600,0:22:04.320
um I guess wallet list float okay so
maybe the vector doesn't have to be
0:22:05.580,0:22:12.120
um maybe it doesn't have to be a numpy array
I think if you do upload collection it does
0:22:12.120,0:22:19.440
require it to be a numpy array because if you
do uh not recreate let's see upload collection
0:22:21.300,0:22:27.060
um here it is upload collection so you
see that where the vectors it's a union
0:22:27.060,0:22:34.260
of in numpy ND array um so I think that if you
use upload collection it expects an ND array
0:22:35.280,0:22:41.700
um but if you do upload records it just it just
expects a list so let me go ahead and fix this
0:22:41.700,0:22:51.420
because the embedding is just going to be a list
so I don't actually need numpy here um but still
0:22:51.420,0:22:58.800
looking at this where did it go the quick start
yeah so you need ID vector and then payload so
0:22:58.800,0:23:03.240
those are the three things that it looks and then
the payload is itself another dictionary that's
0:23:03.240,0:23:08.700
just what is the information attached to this
one so that's what I've got here where I've got
0:23:08.700,0:23:15.960
ID Vector payload and so the the payload is going
to be the content which is the string and then the
0:23:15.960,0:23:23.400
file name and so as a quick reminder this is what
I'm going to be uploading it takes a while so let
0:23:23.400,0:23:29.940
me go ahead and start by let's run the docker
image so I'll show you what that looks like
0:23:34.860,0:23:40.620
and then if we go here we say we see it's
starting this and then volumes it has started
0:23:41.280,0:23:47.340
um started the volume so this volume will grow
as it's running and then if I show you in here
