The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: this and simplify it and just say i am a professional creative writing editor read the following story and provide me okay because i wanted to write you so um yeah actually i think we do have to stay adopt the persona of because what another problem with the feedback that it gave is that it says um uh where it kind of talks about the author and third person but i realized if you're using this tool you want it to be giving feedback to you where it's like it's not talking about your work kind of in an abstract third-party way you want it to be saying you did this do this better right so i want it to give feedback to me so we have to be you have to be very mindful of point of view so as a as a fiction writer like i'm very aware of point of view but also understanding point of view and how large language models handle point of view is really critical for developing acogs artificial cognitive entities so we'll get into that in another video but point of view critical so adopt the persona of a professional creative writing editor so that's that's saying that's the model now thinks okay i am a creative writing editor right so that's its point of view read the following story and provide me detailed feedback so it says this is what i am and i'm talking to you so you're framing the whole conversation to improve the pros hold me to the highest literary standards feedback should be let's see your feedback should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions and then i added some framing here the reason that i did this is because sometimes it got confused and would just continue writing the story um so i like add story like story starts here then you add the story and then end story um and then i added a bunch of white space actually let's just do two um because if you if you use just a single line of white space sometimes that just looks like a paragraph break but if you do like two or three that that clearly signifies like in your brain it says oh this is a whole new section but also gpt3 learns that that means it's a new section as well because from from uh from the large language models perspective it doesn't actually see space it just sees characters so it sees that it sees slash n slash n slash n or sometimes it's going to be slash um rn slash r slash n which slash r is carriage return so that brings the cursor back to the beginning and then n slash n is newline um and so if it sees three slash ends it says okay this is this is like a whole break whereas if it just sees two it's like oh that's just a new line but in this case when i have three vertical white spaces that's actually four four new lines total um so that just kind of gives it says okay this is a new section what am i going to do okay so then the final instruction one thing that i found for especially for these instruct series prompts is that if you if you give it the instructions at the beginning and then you reminded of the instructions at the end you tend to get really good results so you'll notice that this is my standard format where it's like i kind of give it the framing this is what you're about to read this is a story this is what i want you to do so because what that does is it primes the model because there's there the model so in case you don't know this about gpt 3 and large language models they have an internal state that internal state is cued up by by the prompt and so that internal state is represented by an embedding and an embedding is well one way to represent it is um as a vector which is uh embeddings are vectors it's just a particular kind of vector it's a long series of numbers and so what you're doing is you're you're charging it up you're priming it to have the correct internal embedding and it's just the same as what happens to a human like if i give you instructions i say imagine that you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i gave you instructions and now you have an internal state in your head and so gpt3 is no different so we have to have a theory of mind to understand gpt three's mind right and because humans have a theory of mind we can anthropomorphize large language models because it's like okay imagine that you just randomly grab someone off the street and you're giving them instructions that's how you have to write gpt3 prompts okay so now that i've explained why it looks the way that it does let's give this a quick test so let's delete these they're already saved in github so i don't mind deleting them um and they weren't the best anyways um okay so then generate completions so basically oh and one other thing that i need to i need to share is um what i've started doing is breaking up the process into smaller and smaller steps and so the prompts i preload the prompts so that i can just feed them into gpt3 one at a time later and uh and so that's that's fine um let's see so but then we need to also prepare prompts um so by breaking it into smaller steps um i'm just saying like okay read these make it and then i added this little bit here where it will um one thing that i noticed that the the if the story was too long and it was cut off

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

As a professional creative writing editor, I read the following story and provide detailed feedback. The story should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions.

The reason I did this is because sometimes it got confused and would just continue writing the story. So I like to add a story like story starts here, then you add the story, and then end story. And then I added a bunch of white space actually let's just do two.

Because if you if you use just a single line of white space sometimes that just looks like a paragraph break but if you do like two or three that that clearly signifies like in your brain it says oh this is a whole new section. But also gpt3 learns that that means it's a new section as well because from from the large language models perspective it doesn't actually see space it just sees characters. So it sees that it sees slash n slash n slash n or sometimes it's going to be slash rn slash r slash n which slash r is carriage return so that brings the cursor back to the beginning and then n slash n is newline. And so if it sees three slash ends it says okay this is this is like a whole break whereas if it just sees two it's like oh that's just a new line.

But in this case when I have three vertical white spaces that's actually four four new lines total. So that just kind of gives it says okay this is a new section what am I going to do. Okay so then the final instruction one thing that I found for especially for these instruct series prompts is that if you if you give it the instructions at the beginning and then you remind it of the instructions at the end you tend to get really good results.

So you'll notice that this is my standard format where it's like I kind of give it the framing this is what you're about to read this is a story this is what I want you to do. So because what that does is it primes the model because there's there the model. So in case you don't know this about gpt3 and large language models they have an internal state that internal state is cued up by by the prompt and so that internal state is represented by an embedding and an embedding is well one way to represent it is as a vector which is embeddings are vectors it's just a particular kind of vector it's a long series of numbers.

And so what you're doing is you're you're charging it up you're priming it to have the correct internal embedding and it's just the same as what happens to a human like if I give you instructions I say imagine that you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I gave you instructions and now you have an internal state in your head. And so gpt3 is no different so we have to have a theory of mind to understand gpt three's mind right. And because humans have a theory of mind we can anthropomorphize large language models because it's like okay imagine that you just randomly grab someone off the street and you're giving them instructions that's how you have to write gpt3 prompts.

Okay so now that I've explained why it looks the way that it does let's give this a quick test. So let's delete these they're already saved in github so I don't mind deleting them. And they weren't the best anyways. Um okay so then generate completions. So basically oh and one other thing that I need to I need to share is what I've started doing is breaking up the process into smaller and smaller steps.

And so the prompts I preload the prompts so that I can just feed them into gpt3 one at a time later. And so that's that's fine. Um let's see so but then we need to also prepare prompts. Um so by breaking it into smaller steps I'm just saying like okay read these make it. And then I added this little bit here where it will um one thing that I noticed that the the if the story was too long and it was cut off the um and but the uh but the the my my creative writing coach didn't realize that it said this story ended abruptly and I'm like oh yeah that's because it got cut off.

So if we add something to say like story truncated due to length the creative writing editor should know like oh okay I didn't get the whole story but what I did get is you know good. Um okay so let's run that real quick. Cd and we're going to the creative writing coach python prepare prompts. This just runs in a second or two. So let's go to our prompts folder you can see these were just updated. Oh sorry my dog's outside I need to let him in be right back.

Okay and we're back sorry about that. Um okay so then we've updated the prompt where it says uh let's see your feedback should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. And then I added some framing here the reason that I did this is because sometimes it got confused and would just continue writing the story. Um so I like add story like story starts here then you add the story and then end story. Um and then I added a bunch of white space actually let's just do two. Um because if you if you use just a single line of white space sometimes that just looks like a paragraph break but if you do like two or three that that clearly signifies like in your brain it says oh this is a whole new section. But also gpt3 learns that that means it's a new section as well because from from the large language models perspective it doesn't actually see space it just sees characters. So it sees that it sees slash n slash n slash n or sometimes it's going to be slash um rn slash r slash n which slash r is carriage return so that brings the cursor back to the beginning and then n slash n is newline. Um and so if it sees three slash ends it says okay this is this is like a whole break whereas if it just sees two it's like oh that's just a new line.

But in this case when I have three vertical white spaces that's actually four four new lines total. Um so that just kind of gives it says okay this is a new section what am I going to do. Okay so then the final instruction one thing that I found for especially for these instruct series prompts is that if you if you give it the instructions at the beginning and then you reminded of the instructions at the end you tend to get really good results. So you'll notice that this is my standard format where it's like I kind of give it the framing this is what you're about to read this is a story this is what I want you to do. So because what that does is it primes the model because there's there the model. So in case you don't know this about gpt3 and large language models they have an internal state that internal state is cued up by by the prompt and so that internal state is represented by an embedding and an embedding is well one way to represent it is as a vector which is embeddings are vectors it's just a particular kind of vector it's a long series of numbers.

And so what you're doing is you're you're charging it up you're priming it to have the correct internal embedding and it's just the same as what happens to a human like if I give you instructions I say imagine that you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I gave you instructions and now you have an internal state in your head. And so gpt3 is no different so we have to have a theory of mind to understand gpt three's mind right. And because humans have a theory of mind we can anthropomorphize large language models because it's like okay imagine that you just randomly grab someone off the street and you're giving them instructions that's how you have to write gpt3 prompts.

Okay so now that I've explained why it looks the way that it does let's give this a quick test. So let's delete these they're already saved in github so I don't mind deleting them. And they weren't the best anyways. Um okay so then generate completions. So basically oh and one other thing that I need to I need to share is what I've started doing is breaking up the process into smaller and smaller steps.

And so the prompts I preload the prompts so that I can just feed them into gpt3 one at a time later. And so that's that's fine. Um let's see so but then we need to also prepare prompts. Um so by breaking it into smaller steps I'm just saying like okay read these make it. And then I added this little bit here where it will um one thing that I noticed that the the if the story was too long and it was cut off the um and but the uh but the the my my creative writing coach didn't realize that it said this story ended abruptly and I'm like oh yeah that's because it got cut off.

So if we add something to say like story truncated due to length the creative writing editor should know like oh okay I didn't get the whole story but what I did get is you know good. Um okay so let's run that real quick. Cd and we're going to the creative writing coach python prepare prompts. This just runs in a second or two. So let's go to our prompts folder you can see these were just updated. Oh sorry my dog's outside I need to let him in be right back.

Okay and we're back sorry about that. Um okay so then we've updated the
