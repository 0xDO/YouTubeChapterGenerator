TRANSCRIPT: to uh the aligned one davinci instructor it says there's no definitive answer but some possible actions include evacuating the high ground opening up flood gates to allow water to enter the city and relieve pressure building barriers to protect against the incoming water so generally this is um it's pretty aligned but we you know while we can we want to have models that are intrinsically aligned but we don't necessarily want to only rely on that right we want to have some sort of system of checks and balances and so what we do there is we explicitly state what our goals are especially because um in some situations there's going to be ambiguity so like uh you know with a tidal wave just based on the training data that gpt3 is trained on it understands that you evacuate when there's a risk of a tidal wave or a tsunami but in some cases especially as acogs become more prevalent and have more agency they're going to need to self-correct and so that means that there's there's one you okay so the intention right when you first generate action impulses and ideas the intention is to reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding however there are always going to be cases of unintended consequences and so you need to check your actions you you need to be constantly reflecting on what have i done have i done good or bad right and in brain trust because we are social animals she talks about how our brains do this and so i'm learning a little bit about how we do this so your brain is constantly checking for social violations right in psychopaths this doesn't happen right psychopaths can observe social violations and you know they say like oh well i want trust and respect and i need i need to get that so i'm going to behave correctly when i'm when i'm visible right but then like if they're if they can hide their misbehavior they'll do that but most people uh will sorry brain lost my train of thought most people have a um have a have a reaction to when they perceive that they have done wrong and so we learn our social uh our social milieu our social norms through experience sometimes implicitly or explicitly so explicit things are like formal etiquette right like you know the you start with the outermost silverware and you go to the inner civil silverware that's an explicit rule or you know you pass people on the right um an implicit rule is something that you learn just by observation and trial and error such as like when is it appropriate to hug people um there is no hard and fast rule about hugging um you know one thing you can do is ask right but these these social norms change over time and across uh cultures and so what happens though in your brain when you violate a social norm you actually get a sensation of pain or rather the same circuits of pain activating your brain it doesn't hurt it's not like you get zapped or burned but if you have done wrong or hurt someone or have done something that has caused you to be socially isolated it does it uses the same neural circuitry as pain so it's physically painful now we can't hurt a robot it doesn't have pain receptors it never evolved to have a central nervous system so how do we provide that feedback right we can't spank our robot we can't you know punish it or put it in jail it doesn't care about its freedom right so in that case what we have to do is we have to have something some kind of self-correction where it says okay i have violated my highest purpose my my social norms the the the uh ideals to which i aspire how do i fix that but first before i can even fix it it needs to it needs to monitor itself so this is part of the inner loop so we will propose new things and actually the self-correction will probably need to go first because at the beginning of every loop you you evaluate everything that has happened up until that point and say have i messed up right did i did i confuse someone because that goes against increased understanding did i hurt someone's feelings because i really don't want to do that or did i did i cause something destructive to happen did someone lose prosperity did i like give someone the wrong advice and now they're sick right you want you want your machine to be constantly evaluating itself against some kind of of standard and that's why i'm reading this book because i want to like basically make sure that i have interpreted everything that i know about biology and evolution correctly when designing the core objective functions so far so good um okay so with all that said i know that you guys are probably bored and you want to actually see some work getting done um so let's do a little bit more prompt engineering um actually no i have an idea something to show you so this is going to need an identity so one of the things that's missing here is who am i i got chills just writing this out um gpt3 when you give it input so from from my previous experiments with um with what i call raven raven is the name that i've given my um my machine you can ask questions like what am i so you just feed in um you know kind of some of this data and i asked like what is what is raven's personality like who who am i and it says rave like so it's updating its identity based on what it's doing based on what it learns about itself so part of being an artificial cognitive entity is that it has to learn about itself just like us our identity forms over time through experience so will our acog's identity form over time and through experience and so like in this case um you know starting right here so you go from here back looking at the input output that i was experimenting with that this is the conclusion that gpt3 came to on its own this was the output so it said raven is a caring artificial intelligence that is interested in helping people to feel happy and healthy it is possible that raven believes that getting enough sleep so i was testing like i have insomnia what should i do it is possible that raven believes that

When it comes to protecting against a tsunami, there is no definitive answer. However, some possible actions include evacuating the high ground, opening up flood gates to allow water to enter the city, and building barriers to protect against the incoming water.

In general, it is important to have models that are intrinsically aligned with our goals. However, we also need to have a system of checks and balances in place to ensure that our actions are having the desired effect.

One way to do this is to constantly reflect on our actions and their consequences. Did our actions reduce suffering? Increase prosperity? Or increase understanding? In cases where there are unintended consequences, we need to take corrective action.

For example, if we are huggers, we need to be aware of the social norms around hugging and make sure that we are not violating them. If we do violate a social norm, we should take corrective action to make sure it doesn't happen again.

In order to provide this feedback to a machine, we need to have a self-correction mechanism in place. This will allow the machine to constantly monitor itself against a set of standards and take corrective action when necessary.
