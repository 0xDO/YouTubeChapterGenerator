The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here um so today i'm going to try a slightly different format um as you may or may not know um my latest book is now available uh symphony of thought i just got the first run from the printer ordered um but most people read it electronically so it's up here on github um just search for symphony of thought under under my name i've actually got it pinned up here so if you just go to dave github.comshop all my books are up here and plus my most popular repositories um my most popular one of all time is plain text wikipedia which skyrocketed like a year ago on reddit because it was posted on data hoarders i think i posted it there anyways okay so what i'm going to do today is we're going to take a survey of the state of the industry so i ran a poll um a couple days ago about agi because the conversation on twitter at least seems to have changed and i'm trying to figure out why and i think it's because some of the thought leaders you know ilya um sutscover who uh i think he's still at openai anyways goal is agi a big name in the industry 120 000 followers he has been talking about agi more often um you know and there's some like cryptic messages like we have no choice but to embrace the fundamental uncertainty of life um okay so if this agi does this was a big one if this agi business works out there's a potential to sell poverty etc etc um so but it's not just it's not just him and so what uh what i did was i found some other folks um who uh now go take me to my profile how do i go to my profile home there we go um so there are some other people and i i uh so here's another one like is it me or is ai twitter moving faster than usual yes um and then oh man so we'll get to ai art i think actually state of the industry or state of the art we're going to talk mostly about ai art um but i see these these animations and they're incredible um it's happening faster than i thought it would um here's another great one so just check out my uh my twitter dshap automator but so let me scroll down to the poll yeah okay so i posted a poll this was less than a full day ago but and it's only 19 votes so take it with a grain of salt but um people that that see me on on their twitter feed um there seems to be some agreement it's a it's not a majority anymore it was but there there was a there's a strong plurality that people are taking agi seriously um so there's that um i'm trying to again i'm trying to figure out where that came from because like it's not like it's not like there's been any grand news right you you it's it's it's a dangerous business um just tapping into social media trends because you know it would be ideal if you could just point to like the thing that said like okay this is this is happening um an agi means something to different people um let's see yeah this was a good article um with uh with stable diffusion you may never believe what you see on again anyways that's a agi anyways maybe that's all that i've got up on agi so let's talk about ai art instead so first let me show you an example um so this is this is dolly this was a scene that i was trying to illustrate from my novel this is from the the prologue the opening chapter um and so this was an original dolly generation and now they have out painting and so out painting allows you to expand an image and so you see how much bigger it is so like here's the original and you see it was kind of cut off and then what i what you can do is you can expand it and so you see more of this this giant like cockpit for this spaceship and you see uh you know a couple moons outside and uh this guy sitting here alone i won't spoil who it is or where he is but anyways so i just wanted to show that like yeah this is pretty cool um however with the explosion of of uh like in particular stable diffusion it seems like um it seems like dolly's days are numbered unless they've got something um some announcement in the works so here's where i'll tie it back to agi um openai has been very quiet for the last couple weeks it's been quiet to the point that people um are complaining on the forum about um about the low quality of support feedback um like people are just not getting anything from open ai people from openai are not posting anything anywhere either and so typically in the past this like they go they go like radio silent they go communication blackout just before they announce something big so maybe it's going to be the next version of dolly maybe it's going to be gpt 4. so i remember earlier this year there was in the rumor mill it was that gpt-4 was going to drop late summer or fall well it's late summer slash fall um so maybe they're gearing up to release gpt4 who knows so but let's talk about let's talk about um ai uh art so stable diffusion um it's not the first but it's certainly a game changer um and there's been all kinds of um all kinds of drama surrounding it so first there's the the the um the question of ethics and safety so uh some people uh are concerned excuse me that that air that can generate photorealistic images of anyone doing anything is particularly dangerous i mean you know your imagination is the limit um especially as these models improve so like you know all kinds of graphic stuff you know gore whatever whatever you can imagine it can be generated now um and so it's kind of like well if that's the case is it dangerous or is it unethical and so i will reiterate so i've said this on twitter this is not a particularly strongly held position because um why do i have a picture of data and okay anyways but basically my initial thought this is just kind of where i'm at now i'm not going to defend this position so don't attack me for it um my initial thought is that ai is um and and and generation like this if people want gore and grotesque stuff and porn it already exists in spades um i don't think that that throwing ai in the mix is gonna be any different and you know as an author there's there's in

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

People in the AI community seem to be taking the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI) more seriously than in the past. This may be due to thought leaders in the field, such as Ilya Sutskever of OpenAI, talking about the topic more often.

There is concern that with the recent advancements in AI-generated images, it may be possible to create photorealistic images of anyone doing anything. This raises questions of ethics and safety, as it is unclear how this technology could be misused.

At present, it seems that AI is mostly being used to create art. For example, the popular AI tool "Dolly" can be used to generate images like the one shown above. However, with the rise of tools like "Stable Diffusion", it is unclear how long tools like Dolly will remain popular.

It is possible that OpenAI is preparing to release a new version of their GPT tool, which could be used to generate even more realistic images. In any case, it is clear that the landscape of AI is changing rapidly and it is difficult to predict what the future will hold.
