The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: n not make it a little a little prettier okay so here's what we're getting like write a detailed paragraph describing a scenario where one person has to um email another imagine the scenario and tell it like a story what happened why does the email need to be sent write only about the sender intent a sidewalk is crack or needs to be shoveled detailed scenario so what we're going to do is I'm going to generate 100 stories about why these emails need to be sent um so that's what's just about to happen I've got this stuff commented out so you saw the process here um let's see oh and one thing that I need to show you is that in the playground I accidentally overwrote that perfect prompt and I was like and so I wanted to point out um I had forgotten about this until I was like I need this so there's this little handy dandy button so like you can re-run a prompt you can regenerate The Prompt but you can also look at your prompt history and it goes back 30 days so if you did something perfect and you don't remember what you wrote click on the little clock the rewind time button and it will save your life um okay so I'm going to generate some data we'll have 100 stories and then we'll come back and move on to the next step okay the first run is running so I just want to show you what the process looks like um I have it you know outputting to screen so it's like here's the here's the prompt and then here's the output um you've been dating your current partner for about a year and blah blah things are starting to get serious you're asking for advice these are some great stories by the way um so basically what I'm doing here is I'm generating a lot of synthetic data so here's the output we've got 20 so far out of 100 so here's an example it's your cousin's birthday and you want to send her a quick email to say happy birthday you drafted brief's message wish her a happy birthday and hit send um so that's you know that's a that's a that's a totally legit email but then let's sort by size so you're sitting at your desk working on a project for your boss you've been with the company for a few years now and you feel like you're you're due for a raise etc etc so this is like another great example as to why you might want to write an email so what I'm going to do once this is done and actually maybe I can I can I don't need to sit I will let this run in the background so once this is done I will uh how do I get back no don't do that there we go um so I'm going to take some of these stories and I'm going to say write a perfect email from them so let's just go ahead and start prompt engineering that um given the following scenario write the perfect email let's just see if that works all right um so we'll say scenario and then we'll say perfect email um Hi boss let's see I hope you're doing well I wanted to check with you about my email asking for a raise if I know you're busy so I don't want to bother you in person I just wanted to make sure you saw it and that you're considering it I really appreciate what you've done for me and I promise to continue great work if you give me a raise thanks for your time and I'll talk soon um okay so is that congruent with the story you hit send and then you wait okay you already asked for a raise perfect perfect um so yeah um it doesn't have a name that's fine we can I'm not as worried about like subject lines and senders and stuff although we can have subject lines because I did talk about how I have some rules for perfect subject lines so we will do that um I also realized that I didn't have any marketing copy examples um this should generalize well enough for marketing copy should um but now I feel guilty I probably should have that as an example um okay let's try a different scenario we're already up to 50 so it's halfway done um I need to read it write an email asking for time off so let's do this and let's see if the perfect email Hi boss I was hoping I could schedule MIDI I had it work recently I've been feeling my workload is excessive and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed I'd like to sit down with you and discuss how I'm feeling and see if there's anything that can be done to lighten my load a bit that's great okay it's basically just reiterating it but um it's just yeah that's fine so you can see how by having this iterative process it kind of gets better and better um yeah cool so I really like this uh just by saying like write the perfect email like it knows how to be polite um so we will we'll save this prompt um I'll go ahead and come over here and we'll do this add a second new line and we'll do okay scenario and then perfect email and then we'll save this as the um prompt uh let's see scenario to email not text okay so we'll use this to generate the output emails and so what I did was I'll have a folder where we'll have um we'll have the actually I'm going to need to think about how to how to do this because I've got the final emails right this is the final output um actually I know how I'll do it uh I'll show you in a little bit okay I'll pause again and do a little bit more work and then we'll come back basically what I'm going to do just so you know what to expect what I'm going to do is I'm going to start I'm going to use those Baseline intents to generate a few more of those um of those of these types of emails so like we've got the stories this is almost done and so then I'll do I'll basically convert those to bullet points and then I'll have the conversation and then I'll have just the messy versions of the email so instead of the perfect email it'll be like uh an email full of typos one that's overly aggressive and demanding one that doesn't have enough information and so then the perfect email generator will be able to take in if you just give it a list of bullet points it'll take that and run with it if you give it a story it'll take that and run with it if you give it a conversation like a conversation a transcribed conversation with an executive

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

You're sitting at your desk, working on a project for your boss. You've been with the company for a few years now, and you feel like you're due for a raise. You draft a brief message asking for a raise, hit send, and wait.

A few days later, you haven't heard back, so you send a follow-up email. This time, you're more direct, asking if your boss has seen your previous email and if they're considering it. You reiterate your great work for the company and promise to continue if you're given a raise.

Your boss finally responds, saying they're sorry for the delay and that they're considering your request. They ask if you can come to their office for a meeting to discuss it further.

At the meeting, you discuss your workload and why you feel you deserve a raise. Your boss takes your concerns into consideration and decides to give you a raise, effective immediately. You thank them and walk out of their office feeling happy and relieved.
