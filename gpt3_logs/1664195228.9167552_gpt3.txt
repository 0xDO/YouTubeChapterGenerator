The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you've got if you've got um so blockchain is really good because it is for sequential transactions and what we're doing with the memories with the nexus is we're building up a list of sequential transactions and if you have an ai companion that knows everything about you you better well have those encrypted if you value your privacy so anyways just wanted to point that out i have been saying that blockchain will be big for agi this is why is because you're going to want that nexus encrypted and but also not only encrypted a blockchain guarantees that it cannot be manipulated right so remember i mentioned the hosts in westworld where you just selectively delete memories you don't necessarily want to do that because imagine you've got a super powerful agi that's in control of like military tanks you don't want to selectively delete memories like you want it to be accountable you want it to have a cryptographically guaranteed logical sequence of memories um okay so that's all relevant again this is all purely inspired by neuroscience oh fun fact so people with particularly narcissism and a few other personality disorders or mental health disorders their experience of time is not linear um you the the term flashback so ptsd is another example so what happens with a flashback whether it's an emotional flashback or an acute flashback is that your brain shifts back in time to the last time that something happened and so like um they explore this with uh bernard or arnold whatever his name was in um in westworld where his his time indexes are all off and so he's keeps from his perspective he keeps jumping around based on whatever's happening right he doesn't have a linear sense of time and that can be what happens with ptsd narcissism and other disorders where your brain like is so fragmented that like different parts of your consciousness exist in different times so that's another reason why one we want every memory time stamped and two we want it cryptographically verified in a blockchain okay getting off my soapbox all that this does is it searches the index based on a search query that you put in it says find relevant memories so that's all it does this is a big long function it just looks for similar memories i've got a really simple function here it just gives you the in the dot product of your search your search vector and then of the memory that you're querying and so it just says okay what is the similarity between what you're searching for and this other memory your brain does this automatically um what is the term for that there's a specific term um like association right um your brain associates memory so like for instance i'm at home right now so my brain has a whole bunch of memories associated with home um and this so that is actually why you forget what your what you came into a room for because your brain says oh the settings are different so let me let me grab a different set of memories and then you go back where you were and you remember again that is that is what's happening in the background um in real time so again i didn't invent any of this stuff i'm just copying what nature figured out with our brains um so search index and what this does is i just say okay give me the five most relevant memories to whatever is going on right now again ideally in the future this will be 5000 memories it'll be 50 million memories because we want our agi to be smarter than us but right now we're limited by the size of the payload that gpt3 can take okay so then we stack those memories as well so we have the latest memories that are stacked and the older memories that are stacked so that's long-term and short-term memory again i didn't invent any of this stuff i just copy-pasted it into python so then what we do is we go we go through that list of cognitive tasks so the first part of this loop is going to be let's just add a little hashtag this is going to be this is going to be cognitive control loop and then so this each of these prompts is going to be stuff like um what am i doing what should i be doing should i be doing um uh how should i do it but also what should i be thinking about that that is so that's metacognition so what we want is we want this this machine to not only think about what it's doing but what it's thinking about and then provide that answer and then think about it um i've already done lots of experiments gpt3 is really great at these kinds of tasks like i said i'm not going to get it to it in this video just want to like wet your palette but what should i be thinking about and then other things like what are the implications here so like for instance if um if you're driving a car and someone pulls in front of you and like you're going 80 miles an hour and the other car is going 10 the implication is you're about to hit that car right so we want we want to be able to anticipate what are the implications here um so we'll call this anticipation because your brain will automatically anticipate things so we these are these are things in the cognitive control loop that's all relative relevant information that you want to be present in every single loop um and so then another thing is um the core objective functions which so this is this is the steering the moral steering of the ship that i've talked about so my heuristic imperatives which are you want it to reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding so you want your agi to be thinking about these things every single time you don't want it to selectively choose to be moral or not you want it to be moral every single iteration okay so this is the cognitive control loop and then so then we'll do a second one um uh one of these things will will be generating tasks so basically we're going to say like um cognitive oops cognitive tat whoops sorry i really hurt my pinky i was building a retaining wall and it got smashed between two two ninety pound blocks so that's why i'm making more mistakes than usual

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Blockchain is good for sequential transactions because it creates a list of sequential transactions that cannot be manipulated. This is relevant for artificial intelligence (AI) companions because they need to have their memories encrypted in a way that guarantees they cannot be selectively deleted.

Time is not experienced linearly by people with certain disorders like narcissism or PTSD. This is why it is important to have every memory time-stamped and cryptographically verified in a blockchain. This way, our AI can have a linear sense of time and be accountable for its actions.

The search index in our AI's brain works by associating memories with current events. This allows the AI to forget what it came into a room for and to remember again. This is all inspired by how our own brains work.

The cognitive control loop is a series of prompts that our AI uses to think about what it is doing and what it should be thinking about. This includes tasks like metacognition (thinking about one's own thoughts) and anticipation (predicting the implications of current events).

The core objective functions of our AI are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. This is the moral compass that steers the AI's actions.
