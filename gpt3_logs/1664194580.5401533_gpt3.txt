The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: equals filename dot replace premise with script so basically what this line will do is it will grab the premise and just say script and it will have the same otherwise it'll have the same number um okay so that'll be the new file name that's fine and then we will we'll copy paste this line um with open and we'll say scripts so this will change to a new file out file right so new file name and we'll say script right there so that should be good and we'll do exit 0 just to test the first one and so this should be ready once uh as soon as as soon as we've got enough training data so tell you what um this is about as far as i can code right now so i'm gonna pause the video and skip ahead but basically all i'm gonna do is make sure that um that this finishes creating the underlying data and then i'll i'll restart the video once we are once we're ready to start generating the scripts all right pause okay as promised we have 200 premises um a bunch of them i did a i did a gritty noir mystery anime uh was one of them but we've got 200 all kinds of we got mystery fantasy sci-fi and romance and they're all great okay so next up let's do a quick test python generate scripts okay so as a reminder we did this premise of the um uh or the script premise sorry re reset we have a script writer that uses the premises we just made okay there we go that's what i was trying to say so let's do this let's just generate one to make sure it works and then if that works i'm going to pause the video again while it runs because you don't want to sit here and just watch 200 go alright so generate scripts let's see if this throws any errors and if it doesn't let's check to make sure that it outputs correctly oh i didn't have it do any console output um script one hey look at this shannon's farm shannon early 20s shannon look at this perfect okay this is 1400 lines long or characters long so that's uh that's probably right about a thousand tokens um yeah this is great okay so i'm gonna pause the video again while this runs and i'll see you in just a second okay and we're back um we've got almost 200 scripts written so you can just see like hey here's some actual scripts being generated i'm not going to read them all but i'm just going to trust that like hey this works and if you want to go through it and um and take a look at them um in the meantime though while this was running because this has taken let's see 8 22 now i don't know when it paused you can do some math but i think i started about an hour and a half ago now total maybe a little bit more so hour and a half later most of this time has actually been spent waiting because this is this is a slow process okay so we've got that so what i did it while i was waiting so we've got the generate premises we're done with that generate the prompt for the premises we've got that oh let me zoom back in sorry you probably can't see this generate scripts you saw me write this this works just fine you can see the results here um and then whoops and then uh okay so this is the next thing i did i borrowed this from a previous previous project so all this does is create a json l file so let me do python generate json l name data is not defined what do you mean data is not defined um where do i use data oh i meant to delete that okay okay so let's make sure that this file was good scripts.jsonl cool so it looks like that worked so prompt and then it ends with completion you see here where i have nnn script so what i always do is i always add a natural language token at the end openai they recommend doing something like that as your divider but i don't like doing that it doesn't work as well because if you have a natural language token at the end of the prompt then it knows um it knows like okay now it's time to do this particular task so what this data looks like is it what it does let me explain this um so we take the premise and we match it to a pr uh sorry a script and so this script shannon's farm on the day like da da shannon is left to a family farm on her own so basically this this is going to train a model to take any any premise so this could be like a handwritten premise and output a movie script um i know it completely changed the purpose from what i said at the beginning of the video but hey that's how rapid prototyping and research goes let me save that because i don't want to or close that because i don't want to save it okay so this file worked so we've got our we've got our json l file so this is the final product for our training data and then the very last script that i wrote is this fine tune dot pi and again excuse me i um i borrowed it from a previous one so basically all it does is it uploads the file the json l file that we just did and then it calls the fine tune model and i'll pause it again because the fine tuning takes a while to show you but then once it's done it'll actually appear oh and so just so you know how much this cost let me do a quick refresh so everything that you've seen today i started the day at about two dollars so now we're at 11 so generating generating 200 premises which is let's see that's about 139 kilobytes of text data um and then generating 200 scripts from those which is going to be a lot more 330 or 303 kilobytes so this all told was cost about nine dollars so far because i was at about two dollars already when i got started this morning um yeah so nine dollars to generate um to to synthesize the data that's that's not just the fine tuning the fine tuning is way cheaper but this was synthesizing from scratch okay so i think this should be ready um so let's see file upload that does do the pretty print of that and then the fine fine-tune model um okay so yes this should work if i'm not mistaken it might error out so let's do cls python find two fine-tune okay got the file uploaded and let's see status pending okay cool i think this is usually usually it's in in sequential order so davinci fine tune file name file um it

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, we'll take a look at how to use the script premise line to generate new scripts from scratch. First, we'll grab the premise and change the file name to "script." Then, we'll copy and paste this line into a new file called "outfile." Next, we'll do a quick test with Python to generate one script. If everything looks good, we'll pause the video and let the script generate 200 scripts. Finally, we'll use the "fine tune" model to upload the file and train the model.
