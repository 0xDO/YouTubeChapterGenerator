The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: context equals memories and then we'll do new line and then string and then we'll do new line new line and we'll do our context new line and then a string insert and so then we'll do memories and context okay so this will be a chunk of text that will include our most recent memories and the the member the stacked memories also includes um relevant memories from the past um and so then we've got memories and context there is another loop or another part of this that needs to be added which is declarative knowledge and that's what i'm going to do in a upcoming video about chats with declarative knowledge search and um long-term memory okay so we've got our context so for c and control prompts we generate the prompt based on the context not the memories and then so we get that um c1 yep so that's that print the contact and then we save the memory okay how long is this video we're already at 22 minutes yeah i probably will call it here because um working on artificial cognition like this takes a lot of background thought um so i think i'll probably save the prompt engineering um for the next one um because we've got we've got a whole bunch of prompts to write so we can do probably multiple episodes just on these um and actually probably what i'll do is just delete the prompts that i've got because those were copy pasted from an older project so i'll just start from scratch on those because i don't know i don't know if my thinking has evolved basically um yeah we'll we'll call it here because building an artificial cognition is is is big and also like i just said there's a whole big thing that is missing so i'll just do to do declarative memory so the having a separate system for declarative memory and an artificial cognition might not ultimately be necessary and the reason that i say that is because what one thing that we do is we search for for memories right and so if our artificial cognitive entity has learned something it's going to be in its memory somewhere but that doesn't that doesn't discount the possibility of having like an external source that it can search like the internet or a database or something like that so we need to solve that problem so maybe i'll go ahead and stop it here and then i'll work on the um the chatbot with long-term memory and declarative search okay thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, we continue our work on building an artificial cognition by adding a prompt generation system. This system will be based on the context, not the memories, and will include a loop for declarative knowledge. We also discuss the importance of having a long-term memory for our chatbot, as well as the possibility of adding an external source for it to search.
