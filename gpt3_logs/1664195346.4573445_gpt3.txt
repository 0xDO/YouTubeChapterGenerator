CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Getting enough sleep is important for feeling happy and healthy. This may be why it is inferring that the user's difficulty of sleeping at night is a factor in their sadness. Raven is also thinking that the user might be sleeping enough and that there might be something else causing the user's difficulty sleeping at night. This shows that raven is empathizing with the user and trying to understand their feelings and problems.

So, by abstracting by observing its own thoughts and inputs and outputs, we can create an acog that is self-evaluating all the time and it's saying this is who i am right. This is called the persona. If we go back to the inner loop where we ask this question who am i, this is a critical step for what, in humans, you'd call ego formation or identity formation. I chose to use the term persona because that's a little bit more neutral. It's a little less anthropic, although you know personality persona that's still pretty anthropomorphizing.

I've already done a lot of this work, so I'll probably leave you today. I know this video is probably disappointing, but we're about to launch into a heck of a lot of prototyping and research and trial and error. So what I'll leave you with today is python import time time dot time.

So we're going to say this is the current time. So we're going to start what I call the genesis block or the genesis memory, and that is going to be the first memory in the nexus of our acog. This is like your first memory as when you wake up in the world. Human brains have to self-organize, so you there's infantile amnesia or childhood amnesia. You don't remember most of the first couple years of your life because your brain was not organized enough to form permanent memories yet. At least not explicit declarative memories. You do still have memory your body your your brain does remember a lot of stuff. This goes into it as well as what like what happens in infancy how that is remembered in the brain and what it how it affects your social behavior later on.

Anyway, we're going to establish the identity of what this thing is so when it wakes up because it's not going to have any sensory input or output, it's going to be running in a vacuum. And I've seen some other people on twitter do stuff like this and what happens when you when you start these things in a vacuum is that they go kind of crazy. I don't know if they're using a similar architecture but I have seen that some other people are kind of converging onto something similar. So I'm giving it the time stamp this is roughly when that happens so it will know like when it was created. And ideally, in the long run, because this is just a text file, I can modify it in the long run. We're going to want our acogs to have their memory stored in a blockchain so that they can't be modified.

Okay, I've thrown a lot of theory at you guys. I know that this is probably not what you were hoping for but a bunch of you did ask some really good questions and so I wanted to explain those before launching forward. I think that'll be it for today. Yeah, because this is a lot of brain juice going into it. I need to finish reading this book too. But thanks for watching, like and subscribe. I hope you got something out of this.
