The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: anyways I'm diving off into other aspects of Technology my point is that it does not surprise me if you parallelize an operation it goes much faster but also depending on where the constraint is if you have it so think of it this way another way to think of this is imagine you have um one line of cars going down a 16 Lane Highway that's what you're doing before if you have just a single head of attention and so if everyone is constrained to one lane and you have a 16 16 Lane Highway worth of traffic going down one lane it's going to be infinitely slower than if you have all 16 lanes open with 16 Lanes of traffic and so that's why mathematically like when you squish it all it's not just that it goes 16 times slower when you have a traffic jam like that it goes like a thousand times slower right because you know you're not it's not like you know the speed limit's 60 miles an hour and you divide that by 16 and you're going four miles an hour when you go down to one lane of traffic no you go down to like you know a mile every like three hours because it's more complex and I I'm not a math expert but basically traffic jams create bottlenecks that slow the whole system down uh disproportionately and that's kind of what we're finding here is going the opposite way of oh hey we open up more Lanes of traffic and suddenly things are going faster than you'd expect so that's kind of how you see this and this is something that is true in systems engineering which is what I do for my day job so anyways I'm rambling now um thanks for watching this has been your state of the industry update um like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon have a good one

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It is faster to parallelize an operation, but the speed gain depends on where the constraint is. For example, if you have a line of cars going down a 16-lane highway, and everyone is constrained to one lane, the line will move much slower than if all 16 lanes are open. This is because traffic jams create bottlenecks that slow the whole system down disproportionately. So, in this case, opening up more lanes of traffic can actually make the system go faster than you might expect.
