0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

CHAPTER TITLE: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence



TRANSCRIPT:
0:12:08.400,0:12:15.360
all about this because even chat gp3 you know
which is a GPT 3.5 the most recent thing still
0:12:15.360,0:12:20.940
limited and even if you go up by a factor of a
hundred there's still too much information here
0:12:20.940,0:12:24.720
for the model to learn so this is a problem
that we're going to have to be contending
0:12:24.720,0:12:30.240
with for the foreseeable future until there's some
fundamentally different kind of AI model that can
0:12:30.240,0:12:35.640
read all of this or until it's easier to to fine
tune something because honestly the easiest thing
0:12:35.640,0:12:41.580
would be include all of this data in the Baseline
model in the in the foundation model and then it
0:12:41.580,0:12:47.220
knows it just intrinsically but until we get to
that point um because they are really expensive
0:12:47.220,0:12:53.100
to reach train so until we get to that point we're
gonna have to figure out ways of using external
0:12:53.100,0:13:00.240
databases or knowledge bases so that's the
problem statement we've got 1.7 megabytes of text
0:13:00.240,0:13:09.240
here what do we do with it well this is really
dry stuff super dry so what can we do with it
0:13:10.380,0:13:15.360
um well one thing that we can do is uh I've
got this really handy dandy thing where I've
0:13:15.360,0:13:24.120
got it broken up by page right and you see
that like um in many cases the the sentence
0:13:24.120,0:13:33.000
you know will continue so the page the page um
a a barrier is not necessarily a good semantic
0:13:33.000,0:13:38.040
barrier and so what we mean by a semantic
barrier or a logical barrier is you might
0:13:38.040,0:13:43.680
still cut something off right in the middle of
of an idea or a thought but it is still a good
0:13:43.680,0:13:49.200
enough thing to break because when you look at
how long this is this is 20 000 characters long
0:13:49.200,0:13:56.640
so this is probably about two windows worth so
we can we can we can have gpt3 read most of this
0:13:57.240,0:14:01.380
um actually here let me pause it for a second and
let's do a quick experiment instead of just tell
0:14:01.380,0:14:06.180
sorry I was just saying instead of uh telling
you I'll show you okay so we put this in here
0:14:06.180,0:14:13.320
it's 5 800 tokens long our maximum is four
thousand um so if we just split something
0:14:13.320,0:14:20.040
like this in half right so it's twenty thousand
uh characters so we split it in half we summarize
0:14:20.040,0:14:26.700
it that way we may be able to do something with
it um but the question is or the problem then is
0:14:26.700,0:14:33.180
we don't know exactly what we want out of it
right so let's think about this what kind of
0:14:33.180,0:14:37.800
information if we wanted to make like a Wikipedia
right maybe that's maybe that's a good way to go
0:14:38.520,0:14:45.900
um is is what are what are the implications
here so in this case um you know boxing matches
0:14:45.900,0:14:53.100
sued Don King oh this is fun um uh for Rico
charges okay and they refer to other codes
0:14:54.180,0:15:01.500
um and so basically it what this is doing is it's
using language to build um a web of like reasoning
0:15:01.500,0:15:06.960
and logic so this actually sounds kind of like
a Knowledge Graph so I'm wondering what if we
0:15:06.960,0:15:10.560
what if we use this to build a knowledge rest
I've never built a Knowledge Graph this is fun
0:15:11.340,0:15:16.260
um so maybe maybe what what the the goal here is
is let's build a Knowledge Graph okay so let's
0:15:16.260,0:15:21.240
go back over to chat GPT in just a second and ask
it what a knowledge graph is and how to build one
0:15:22.860,0:15:29.220
okay I was able to get right logged into GPT
or chat GPT sorry what is a knowledge graph
0:15:30.480,0:15:33.600
let's see what it says a knowledge graph is
a data model that represents a collection
0:15:33.600,0:15:38.700
of interconnected data and Concepts typically
organized around entities and their relationships
0:15:38.700,0:15:43.980
it is used to represent and organize large volumes
of structured and unstructured data in a way that
0:15:43.980,0:15:49.800
allows for easy querying and visualization of
relationships okay and then it looks like it froze
0:15:49.800,0:15:57.720
including search engines recommendation systems
and natural language it's gonna freeze up um so
0:15:57.720,0:16:03.840
anyways uh yeah so then once this is unfrozen
the next question I'll ask is um or can I hit
0:16:03.840,0:16:10.860
Escape you cannot abort um so the next question
is uh that I'll ask is what kind of format is it
0:16:12.000,0:16:17.040
um or I'll pause it until it unfreezes or I will
pause the video Until It unfreeze I don't know if
