The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: here the uh these instructions are super short because text davinci o2 is pretty darn good um okay so let's run this oh wait i actually need to save it okay so let's see with open um what did i name that folder premises uh premises slash uh i guess i need a file name um let's do let's start at one and go to 200 file name equals premise underscore dollar or a text insert i don't remember the name of that right now text and then we'll do i okay so that will give us a serial number so we'll then we'll say premises that and do file name write encoding equals utf-8 i always do utf-8 because gpt3 sometimes outputs stuff that will not encode an ascii or other simpler things and utf-8 is just universal um so we'll do oops as out file out file dot right uh premise i think that's i think that's all i need to do um and then we'll do an exit right here so what i often do is just for debugging and testing i'll just have it do one instance um and then let's add a print print premise we'll do ui newline new line premise so that way we can separate them all out exit so that'll just be a quick test make sure okay i think that's it so python generate premises can i zoom in on this can i make this bigger edit properties uh cursor no not cursor size font there we go make the font a little bit bigger so you can see there we go look at that beautiful let's go a little bit bigger so that you can see what the heck is going on you don't have to squint at your screen 36 that's enormous maybe that's a little too big ah heck with it no module named openai really i forgot to re okay so i recently reinstalled my computer um pip install open ai the rest of this while that's installing the rest of these um time and regex are our default um with uh gpt3 um so you don't need or not gpg3 python sorry um the only the only module i need to install here is open ai okay successfully built installing it's doing all this fun stuff okay let's try that again python generate premises error communicating is not valid under interesting it doesn't like it okay i guess it doesn't like my empty whatchamacallit here so we'll just do blah blah maybe i should exclude that if i'm not going to have anything meaningful in it okay let's try again do a clear screen generate premises and the answer is save gpt3 log is not defined oh right because i grabbed this function from something else um save gpt3 log um so i usually in in a lot of my projects is i'll save every interaction with gpt3 so let me just comment that out um my bad sorry again i told you i was going to go through the entire process um this is this is what prototyping looks like with dave um hopefully it'll work this time fail fast and keep going there we go okay cool look at this um incomplete format oh yeah i did do that i it i called me out on my on my crap i messed it up here okay the sky is orange and the sun is red casting an ear glow over the small town of shepherdstown um it really likes shepherdstown doesn't it i wonder how often it will do shepherdstown because the the one up here also says shepherdstown um interesting okay whatever if it if it lights that that's fine um we'll see if it if it repeats that but let's go fix this thing because i missed we need the percent s for file name okay and that should if i'm not mistaken it will not have yeah it did not succeed okay generate premises let's see what it does this time shannon left to run the family okay so this generated a premise um yep she knows it would be inappropriate to pursue a relationship with someone she is employer so that's a that's a typo that doesn't make any sense shannon and diego must find a way to resist their feelings so this came up with a with a romance um so one thing you can do is i often will do um i'll often have placeholders so like let's say we want to modify the premise for a random story let's say like you know romance story actually let's do it this way so we'll do romance and instead of doing um instead of doing 200 of each one we'll do like we'll do like 50. so i'll do like romance um science fiction fantasy and like uh literary fiction or something so we'll just do 50 of each and we'll do premise romance there we go i think this will be good so then we'll get it we'll get a broader variety um yes okay so then we can assume that this yes premise1.txt yay look at that and actually let's switch this open with choose another program notepad plus plus always use notepad plus plus okay so there you have it you see we've got a premise um for a story and so let's go ahead and close that and that that took um what am i doing manage account okay usage this will take a minute to load but this is stupid cheap um because that was like 200 that was like 200 um tokens um so yeah that was that last one was 164 tokens and it cost less than a penny 266 tokens cost 2 cents so you know if i generate 200 of these premises it'll be about a dollar right um and if you've been watching my youtube channel this month um everything that i've shown you has cost two dollars that is how cheap gpt3 is getting to use okay so a quick little aside let's comment out the exit so we should generate now 50 premises um of romance um and then we'll change this to sci-fi fantasy and other stuff do a quick save so now we'll do cls python generate premises okay so basically this is step one of generating synthetic data and i've been doing this for let me pause my video for a second to see how long okay so that was 15 minutes um from zero to getting um a unlimited number of synthetic data we uh we're going from here and you see it's outputting everything as it goes it looks like it's using some similar stuff over and over again interesting jenna is looking forward to the weekend okay so it is it is a little bit repetitive that's interesting i wonder if there's something we can do to make it a little less repetitive at the beach house beach house all right so solutioning time this is way too darn repetitive um i think we might need

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The instructions for using the text davinci o2 are very short because the tool is quite user-friendly. However, I encountered some errors when trying to generate synthetic data.

I first forgot to install the open ai module, which caused an error when I tried to run the script. After installing the module, I tried again and got an error about an incomplete format. I realized I had made a mistake in the code and fixed it.

Finally, I was able to generate some premises, but they were very repetitive. I think this is due to the small amount of data I supplied. To fix this, I will generate premises for multiple genres of stories and combine them. This should give a more varied set of results.
