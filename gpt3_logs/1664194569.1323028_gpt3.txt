figuring out um let's see um construct that's a good one construct a three act structure for the following yeah sure grammarly is like the most nagging grammar teacher ever but it helps me be a better writer also speaking of between gpt3 and grammarly you combine those two you're an unstoppable writer you can produce content so fast construct a three-act structure for the following um story premise um each each act should have a brief description one to two sentences okay premise so we'll do a premise there and now we'll do um three act structure act one all right let's see what this does it might just be all right let's see how this compares all right i guess i have to read it all out okay it all begins with samir a young man from a wealthy family meets naina a simple girl from a small village nina has come to the city to make a better life for herself she is immediately attracted to samir but is too shy to say anything oh a shy girl story um one day out of the blue samir expresses his feelings for naina and confesses his love for her nyena is overjoyed and eagerly accepts his proposal they begin to date and their families approve of the match however just as things seem to be going well samir smears father suddenly dies interesting leaving him the sole heir to the family business samir is forced to take on a lot of responsibility and doesn't have much time for naina oh oh man this is a good story i want to watch this movie uh naena begins to feel neglected and wonders if samir is really the man she thought he was um samir is soon caught in a world of money and power and nina feels like she is losing him one day she decides to go back to her village leaving samir behind samir realizes how much he loves nina and how much he has been neglecting her he decides to go to her village and confess his love nina is hesitant but eventually agrees to give him another chance they share a passionate embrace in their families rejoice at the news of their reunion oh man i

screenplays okay so then let's try this again save the cat plot point one okay let's see what happens [Music] i don't like it it's not working hmm okay so this is where we have to get more and more creative because it's just regurgitating it and that's not exactly what i want and i want to avoid doing a doing a few shot example here let's break this down even simpler write a scene write the opening scene for the following no we we really do need an outline um let's see what was it translate or rewrite rewrite this the following premise into an outline outline all right let's see if this works so again i don't know what i'm doing here i'm just experimenting rapid iteration okay again it's just their families rejoice i guess this is okay because then this we can break each of these points down into we can break them down further um

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Trying to say sorry. I'm thinking really fast and my mouth can't keep up.

We need to get a minimum of 200 samples in order to fine tune a model that is open ai's recommended um kind of baseline minimum okay pardon me i have to check um i have to check something okay sorry about that pause um but i think that's fine for you guys as watching the video just skipped ahead okay so now we've got um 30 uh well zero one one through 29 um premises um just scrolling up here.

Francois is a young woman who lives in paris with her husband. Um oh that looks like that repeated that's okay it's okay if we get some repetition.

So what have we learned so far? We've learned to turn the temperature up a little bit. Let's go up a little bit higher next time just to see. Um it can start to go off the rails so that's why i have the the console output just so i can see what what's doing um as i'm generating this data.

But already i've got about you know what is this 30 items um how much data is this this is 24 kilobytes of data um that i didn't have to write. All i did was tell the machine what i wanted it to do.

All right so first let's update our starting point so we'll go from 30 to 45. We'll just do 15. And let's do a bollywood romance story. Um and this is going to take a while but i will explain stuff to you um as we go and if it gets too boring i'll pause the video so it'll just skip ahead so don't worry if i if i pause the video and it skips ahead it's just because i'm letting some of this process finish.

Okay so let's do the generate premises but we change the prompt to bollywood romance and we've got the prompt premise and now the output is still premise romance and we're doing from number 30 to 45.

Okay let's go let's see what happens let's see how these go.

Ria and raj have been married for five years. They have a two-year-old daughter. Look at this they moved to mumbai oh man this is wonderful um it's so creative and look how fast it's spitting this stuff out i could never i could never write this fast no human could no 10 people could so i'm just churning out um looks like it is a little repetitive raj and simran of course it could be that raj is a common name um i i i work with a lot of indian folks and i know that there are some common names like my name is dave that's freaking common right so like i know that like karthik and satish are ultra common names in uh in india um raul there's another common one so yeah it looks like having the temperature a little bit higher is good i'm not seeing repetitive patterns in here even the names are often unique that's good.

Okay so while this is running let's see what are we up to 36 so we've got about 10 more let's grab one of these oops if i know where i'm going okay so let's grab this and and start start figuring out um let's see um construct that's a good one construct a three act structure for the following yeah sure grammarly is like the most nagging grammar teacher ever but it helps me be a better writer also speaking of between gpt3 and grammarly you combine those two you're an unstoppable writer you can produce content so fast construct a three act structure for the following um story premise um each each act should have a brief description one to two sentences okay premise so we'll do a premise there and now we'll do um three act structure act one all right let's see what this does it might just be all right let's see how this compares all right i guess i have to read it all out okay it all begins with samir a young man from a wealthy family meets naina a simple girl from a small village nina has come to the city to make a better life for herself she is immediately attracted to samir but is too shy to say anything oh a shy girl story um one day out of the blue samir expresses his feelings for naina and confesses his love for her nyena is overjoyed and eagerly accepts his proposal they begin to date and their families approve of the match however just as things seem to be going well samir smears father suddenly dies interesting leaving him the sole heir to the family business samir is forced to take on a lot of responsibility and doesn't have much time for naina oh oh man this is a good story i want to watch this movie uh naena begins to feel neglected and wonders if samir is really the man she thought he was um samir is soon caught in a world of money and power and nina feels like she is losing him one day she decides to go back to her village leaving samir behind samir realizes how much he loves nina and how much he has been neglecting her he decides to go to her village and confess his love nina is hesitant but eventually agrees to give him another chance they share a passionate embrace in their families rejoice at the news of their reunion oh man i can imagine so much song and dance in this bollywood picture okay so let's see how that has translated to a three-act structure act one um she's immediately attracted okay out of the blue it almost looks like it's just okay it's just splitting it up um this is not this is okay um break the following um uh following premise down into a list of major plot points use the save the cat model for screenplays okay so then let's try this again save the cat plot point one okay let's see what happens [Music] i don't like it it's not working hmm okay so this is where we have to get more and more creative because it's just regurgitating it and that's not exactly what i want and i want to avoid doing a doing a few shot example here let's break this down even simpler write a scene write the opening scene for the following no we we really do need an outline um let's see what was it translate or rewrite rewrite this the following premise into an outline outline all right let's see if this works so again i don't know what i'm doing here i'm just experimenting rapid iteration okay again it's just their families rejoice i guess this is okay because then this we can break each of these points down into we can break them down further um
