TRANSCRIPT: this one a little bit more um yeah I wonder I wonder if it was confused because this one is like it is complete so let's grab yeah this one this one is this one is low quality because it has no but I gave it a four right um so I'll copy that as a one and then so we've got a five so let's find a let's find something that I feel like is truly a three tormented by Inner Demons so this one's interesting because it's pretty long so anyways what what you would do is you would accumulate um a bunch of these and grade them and and fine-tune a model that is going to generate based on um the inputs so what you need what I'll need to do is record the inputs um and there's all kinds of different ways to record the inputs so let me actually take a note of this so um let's see overall gold who do sources process um uh let's see input formats so one input format is just um list of appeal terms which is what we're doing now um another thing would be a chat log so like between a a an author and a reader um or a librarian and a patron and so because one way that you find books is that you have a conversation right and so by having by having training data where you have a conversation with someone where it's like what kind of story do you want to read let me ask you all kinds of things about a story that you want to read um and that's called a reference interview um so uh let's see AKA reference interview and gpt3 knows how to do a reference interview so list of appeal terms a reference interview um let's see a uh something that's like I want I want to book that dot dot dot where you just kind of stream of Consciousness um that sort of thing and so the idea here is that you train it to um oh here we go um list of comp titles there we go okay so the idea is that you train it on a variety of input formats but what it always does is it always outputs um it always outputs a synopsis a good plot synopsis and so you want it to conform to certain standards right um so process um then we'll do I need to clean up this this document but the discriminator for uh synopsiscan um so uh let's see uh um must have all three pillars [Music] um plot character setting um let's see all characters must be named um setting must be named dated and described Etc and then plot needs clear beginning middle and end with narrative progression and or character arcs um actually I guess the character arcs um all characters must be named and have arcs um okay so basically you're kind of establishing the criteria of by which you're going to measure the the synopsis that are generated also let me do a quick time check okay we're already at 21 minutes so I might call it here uh because you all seem to like these shorter videos where they're around 20 to 30 minutes some people really like ones that are longer um but anyways so I did do a fine tune model so let me let me just go ahead and pause and show you the fine-tuned model that I did audio transcribe oh that's the new engine I'm like huh um Okay cool so that's that must be the whisper engine all right so synopsis so let's see um I want a story like Harry Potter um but much darker and in space so they're like epic Space Opera um dark and violent um uh uh let's see romantic subplot um okay and so then we do synopsis and this is the this is my first fine-tuning experiment with this we'll turn the temperature up and we'll turn that up to a thousand let's see what it does not bad here we go so this the the fine-tuning training data for this is right here synopsis.json l so let me show you how this data looks so and you're we're welcome to use this just be careful because it costs about thirty dollars to fine tune this one so the input is it's just a brief description with then a list of appeal terms and then synopsis it follows that same format and then the completion is a synopsis so the idea here though is rather than humans go in and rate the synopsis based on the input I want to have that Gan where you have several input formats and then it generates a good synopsis but then we also have so that will learn to get better but then the discriminator gets better right so how do we do that I haven't quite figured that out because if you have two engines that are feeding off of each other and competing one they're both trying to get better over time ideally this should ultimately create really robust uh great plot synopses um and so we'll see about how to do that but let's see what this um what this generated okay so um The Story begins in a dark gritty alternate

==========

The story begins in a dark, gritty alternate universe. The main character, a young woman named Delphine, is a kicked around misfit. She's been raised by a single mother who's never seemed to care about her and she's constantly picked on by her classmates. Delphine's only solace is her daydreams, which she imagines as grand adventures in alternate universes.

One day, Delphine's dreams come to life when she's suddenly transported to another world. This other world is a magical place full of amazing creatures and adventures. She quickly makes friends with a group of other young people who have also been transported to this world. Together, they begin to explore their new surroundings and try to figure out how they got there.

As they investigate, they discover that they're not alone in this world. There are others who have been brought here before them, including some people who are now evil. It turns out that this other world is a place where people's deepest desires and fantasies come true. The problem is that not everyone wants the same thing, so conflicts begin to arise.

Delphine and her friends must band together to try and stop the fighting and find a way back to their own world. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that this is not going to be an easy task.
