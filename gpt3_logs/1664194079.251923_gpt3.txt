The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: we actually don't need to do a json dump we just need to out file right content plus n so let's try this again and then it should reload it yes there we go that looks right yeah yeah okay so then if we do a search for like none found you see it's got plenty of examples so counterexamples it'll know to say none found so here's another thing with fine tuning you can have some errors in the training data um like you know like that last one that i showed you i think it's the very last one yeah so the patient will go home with vicodin and pain because that's not really a test but because there's almost 200 other examples it will kind of like smooth that out it'll be like oh maybe that was the wrong wrong answer so now we've got fine tune so because this is a relatively straightforward problem i'm going to try and fine tune it on curie which is 10 times cheaper to fine-tune and use than davinci which so this is like you know operational costs so let's go ahead and do python fine tune dot pi make sure it goes file uploaded and it's pending okay pending um okay so we'll pause it one last time and once it's done we'll go test it it's almost over sorry this video is so long alright gang it's all done um the uh the fine tune is done fine tune david shapiro medical questions so let's give it a test let's open up a random context so we'll just completely random feet and hand cramping so what we'll do is we'll just grab this one whoops you don't need to see my spotify and we will try each of those endpoints or each of those tasks so list all medications medications and you see i've got the temperature set to zero maximum length 256. hmm [Laughter] hiv lots of hiv uh that could be because we fine-tuned on curie that's funny um all right but let's see was this even used yes it takes insulin bacitracium yeah okay so we'll call that a partial success again this started on davinci and we fine-tuned it on curie so might not might not work okay um list all tests non-specified yeah see it's getting it's getting super super repetitive yep does the patient have hiv the patient has a history of hiv for 21 years yeah okay um but yeah okay so it was correct and that it said and unspecified um it's interesting that it keeps spitting out more i'm wondering if that's just because we we fine-tuned it on curie i'm not going to worry about refined tuning this the data's out there you can test it yourself on davinci we can all you can also just take the script and just run it again and get more data um yeah okay so tests let's let's also shorten the output length to like 20. um list all prognosis so what did i do diagnosis prognosis medication none found none found found this thing is glitchy okay so this we'll we'll say that this is only a mild success um so maybe maybe this task is too complex for curie yeah okay so i diagnosed this with broke i diagnose you with dead um okay so curie doesn't work don't waste your time on that um let's try a different one just to see so we'll grab another neighbor of this one four thousand actinic neoplasm that sounds painful um nan why does it say nan okay um list all medication wow i misspelled it the same way um okay list all medication maximum length 20. bacitracin ointment and then what is the element radio frequency then shave shave excised for the upper dermal layer with the element radio frequency wave unit interesting i don't know if that's actually a medication but it looks like a a process was done 50 trike let's make this a little bit longer let's go 40. okay so yeah it looks it looks like a pretty definitive um curious not up to this task list all diagnosis enlarging skin neoplasm actinic neoplasm left after left upper cheek that's fine and then we'll do prognosis oh that's not bad and then it starts repeating itself yeah um and then what was it tests let's all test for a recheck yeah okay that's the same thing okay um i was hoping this would do better but again right at the last minute i decided to try and experiment and run it on curie i think this is definitive that the curie is meh probably with more training data curie could work better because remember 200 is the minimum so if i were to do this again i would say let's double triple quadruple the number of samples let's manually check the samples to make sure they're good and then also let's try it on davinci i will let you the audience try this because the scripts are here so all you have to do is just run generate data and it will just accumulate more data in here and because it'll pull from four thousand or three thousand medical texts um and then so you generate more data then you format the data it'll replace the medical.json file so this is 503 kilobytes and then you run fine tune and away you go um thanks for watching uh this was really informative i hoped you liked it and got a lot out of it

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro demonstrates how to fine-tune a machine learning model to better understand medical questions. He begins by explaining that it is unnecessary to do a JSON dump when outputting data to a file. He then demonstrates how to fine-tune a model on the cheaper Curie platform, which is 10 times less expensive than the Davinci platform.

Shapiro shows how the model can be tested on a variety of medical questions. In some cases, the model is able to provide accurate answers. However, in other cases, the model is not as accurate, particularly when it comes to more complex questions.

Overall, Shapiro's video provides a helpful overview of how to fine-tune a machine learning model for improved accuracy.
