how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:03:05.440,1:03:09.520
not horizontal horizontal right that's you know
okay are you measuring the right thing because
1:03:09.520,1:03:12.880
if you're not measuring everything it might end
up like this it's horizontal but you wanted it
1:03:12.880,1:03:17.520
like this right so inner alignment is you know you
got to measure all three axes instead of just one
1:03:17.520,1:03:22.320
or two and so that would be an example of inner
alignment but then outer alignment is why the hell
1:03:22.320,1:03:28.560
do you need a book that's flat and floating right
there's no there's no objective value of having
1:03:28.560,1:03:34.240
that so what you actually need for outer alignment
is not how is the book oriented but is it readable
1:03:34.240,1:03:38.000
right so that is an example of the difference
between inner alignment and outer alignment
1:03:38.640,1:03:45.200
um okay so went down many rabbit holes it's
also been an hour so i might call it a day um
1:03:46.560,1:03:50.800
if there's anyone on chat i see we we we're
bouncing between seven and eight folks
1:03:50.800,1:03:55.600
so if there's any last questions go ahead and ask
them now otherwise i'll call it a day and we'll uh
1:03:55.600,1:04:01.120
well yeah say it's a successful live stream let's
see back on our simulation masters so this is some
1:04:01.120,1:04:06.880
rando um maybe it has less to do with our biology
and more to do with the ideas we come up with who
1:04:06.880,1:04:12.960
knows what any species might come up with um with
an alternate history that's a possibility okay so
1:04:14.240,1:04:20.160
if we are in a simulation and the point
is curiosity or scientific curiosity
1:04:21.520,1:04:27.600
maybe it's not our genes or you know our
phenotype that they're trying to figure out
1:04:28.160,1:04:35.040
maybe it's they're trying to create situations
for us to solve problems so what if what if we
1:04:35.040,1:04:39.920
are actually in a simulation for another species
that is facing climate change and that is our
1:04:39.920,1:04:43.920
purpose maybe our purpose is to solve climate
change or something that's going to happen in a
1:04:43.920,1:04:48.800
million years from now right maybe maybe we're in
such a long running simulation maybe it's billions
1:04:48.800,1:04:52.800
of years right maybe there's a species that is
running a simulation to figure out what to do
