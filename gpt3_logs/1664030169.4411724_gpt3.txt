0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:15:13.560,0:15:21.000
little tiny breadcrumb to say give me a numbered
list um so I might do the same here just so that
0:15:21.000,0:15:25.620
way because sometimes you might end up with
something where it's like hey I'm going to
0:15:25.620,0:15:31.080
come up with a completely new idea um but if you
tell it what you want implicitly or explicitly
0:15:31.080,0:15:37.800
so this is an implicit request of the machine
so this might this might break it we'll have to
0:15:37.800,0:15:46.860
after we run it we might um we might have to come
back to this um okay let's go here okay request
0:15:49.500,0:15:53.940
all right and then I think it's
time to start coding actually
0:15:55.920,0:16:02.760
um because what I like to do is before
I get too far um actually no well hmm
0:16:04.380,0:16:08.760
let me take a look at uh at the
readme how far do we want to go
0:16:09.960,0:16:15.120
okay so we got the iteration so we're
already halfway done brainstorm some facts
0:16:15.120,0:16:21.060
or points to include for each section okay
so let's try this then let's try our hand at
0:16:22.380,0:16:27.480
yada yada yada I wish I hadn't
closed those other ones okay so given
0:16:37.560,0:16:47.160
ah let's see I have the following uh
blog request to write um I am focusing on
0:16:48.360,0:17:01.560
um writing one second at a time um or uh
let's see I need to brainstorm uh no I
0:17:01.560,0:17:10.980
need to jot down some notes about each section
before I proceed now each section this section
0:17:12.780,0:17:20.520
um this section before I proceed okay um
section so then we'll just say what is Shinto
0:17:22.260,0:17:24.720
and then we'll say um let's see
0:17:27.300,0:17:36.660
here are my research notes on this
section I need to write everything I know
0:17:37.320,0:17:40.500
about this and let's see what it does
0:17:48.900,0:17:49.400
okay
0:17:52.200,0:17:58.680
here are my let's say let's let's see what
happens we say detailed research notes there we go
0:18:01.200,0:18:02.280
much better
0:18:09.660,0:18:18.540
the yep you say Grand shrine god of the sun
goddessama thratsu okay this is all in line
0:18:18.540,0:18:23.280
with what I'm reading in my book so it looks
like it is um this is actually one that I'm
0:18:23.280,0:18:29.220
not sure I haven't read about that in the book but
anyways so it does look like it's being accurate
0:18:30.360,0:18:37.440
um although I wish this was a little bit more
I do I like the the that it it seemed like it
0:18:37.440,0:18:44.700
produced a little bit more when it was a list
so what let's see if we give it a clue um yeah
0:18:47.100,0:18:54.000
Shinto is the largest with over 100 million follow
your followers located in the city ize um first
0:18:58.380,0:18:59.700
and then if we do this again
0:19:01.440,0:19:08.100
um see but this isn't everything that you know
right like I said I asked for detailed research
0:19:08.100,0:19:17.220
notes I need to write everything I know and
it gives me six bullet points really really um
