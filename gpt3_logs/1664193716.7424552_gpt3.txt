person wants to understand how uh how to maintain a healthy relationship perfect great it sounds like they have a lot of issues to work on uh let's see skip forward to the end they may also benefit from joining a support group where they can discuss issues with other who are going through the same thing that is fantastic advice they may also benefit from reading books about healthy relationships and dating etiquette see so this is this is what i mean by um by having these core objective functions built into an agi which will allow it to have that pro-social perspective on everything so let's move on to the next example so this one is anxiety about climate change oh this wasn't from reddit this was a news article i found so this i just took the i took the the first bit of a news article i searched for climate change um just to show that that these functions can actually um can can address more things than just interpersonal issues so reduce suffering let's see what it says about about uh about this and um let's see this person is suffering from anxiety related to the crisis um they're experiencing denial fear anger and sadness uh yeah so it's it's cueing off on this stuff it doesn't fully understand that this is a news article uh and that is that is because of again i need to do a little bit more more work on the training data set but i wanted to share this this initial success so it is important for this person to recognize that their symptoms are related to the chronic climate crisis and not something else if they are concerned that they may be experiencing symptoms of depression they can seek out counseling or treatment so again this is this is looking at it for a very specific lens where it's clear that like okay we're talking about anxiety so maybe there's depression or ptsd or other things associated with it and honestly i think that there's some wisdom in that because not everyone has climate anxiety right so i wonder if there's some comorbidity there where someone who is who is predisposed to climate anxiety might also have underlying conditions so this this model is not explicitly stating that uh but i think that there is some wisdom in that and it could be worth exploring uh and that is uh if if that's not the case that's fine um this will be improved as the training data set improves so let's go to increase prosperity co so prosperity has a has a major major implications for climate change so let's see what it says about increasing prosperity in light of climate change prosperity is curtailed by anxiety related to climate change the current level is fairly low but is still impacting their ability to thrive a prosperous life for this person would include a more stable emotional state which would allow them to better cope with the with the challenges of the future again this is all very sage wisdom even if this is just a quote statistical probability of what someone might say this is valuable information and then you see it started repeating itself again which um this is this is why i need to improve the quality of the data set um it just started repeating itself verbatim um again this is this is a prototype so thank you for your patience um and finally increase understanding i can spell i know words um increase understanding this person is asking how they can manage their anxiety about climate change they may benefit from learning how to self-regulate their emotions and to set smart goals i'm not sure what those are but it's probably drawing from something that it read about anxiety management it is also let's see skipping forward to the end it is also important for this person to recognize that they are not at fault for feeling anxious about the climate crisis that is great it is important for them not to feel ashamed or guilty about their feelings and instead seek out help in managing their anxiety see this is wonderful um this is this is very sage advice uh let's see let's move on to the last example and then i'll let you go this one is much much shorter let's see and i think this um this came from an anxiety uh subreddit so let's see reduce suffering this person is suffering from social isolation and depression they are also experiencing feelings of guilt shame and unworthiness this person might benefit from counseling or therapy to help them cope with their depression and build a sense of belonging they may also benefit from group therapy in order to build a sense of connection with others it is possible that this person is struggling with mental health issues due to their recent events in their life if this is the case they may just need to seek out some sort of counseling or therapy to help them cope with their symptoms it is also possible this person has social anxiety and feels they do not belong in the world if this is the case they meet they may need some sort of intervention or treatment in order to overcome their social anxiety it is important for this person to find healthy ways to cope with their symptoms in order to prevent them from becoming severe enough to cause harm to themselves or others so i like this is great this is if you were to have these thoughts in your mind when deciding how to interact with this person this is all really valuable stuff okay so let's move on to increase prosperity this person's prosperity is curtailed by negative emotions they are experiencing they are feeling
