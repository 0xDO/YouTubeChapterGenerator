The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: of these Baseline intents um cancel a meeting uh no I don't want you to write the email imagine the scenario describe the email in a paragraph include relevant names um now I want you to write like uh just run it again one person is writing to you the and it's just parroting back what I asked no give me like imagine a scenario I wonder if we change this okay that's a little bit better detailed scenario hi name and that's yeah this is where uh this is where gbt3 often really falls down where sometimes it's just it's complete garbage um like if if you if you give this instruction to a human um you know it's like imagine a scenario let's see like yeah let's um invent the uh the names and background information um and then we'll say describe the scenario in a paragraph um let's see and then we'll shorten this intent cancel meeting all right let's see if that works and then it's just writing the email and it's writing an email okay I might need to switch to fuse shot on this um yeah this is not cooperating I'm going to pause this and do some do some experimentation because this is this is being frustrating okay I think I have a better I think I have a better prompt it says write a detailed paragraph describing a scenario where one person has to write an email to another imagine the scenario and tell it like a story so this I think fixed it write what happened and why does the email need to be sent right only about the sender intent cancel a meeting so I've run this a few times and it seems to be pretty pretty consistent it is 8 am the day of an important meeting and you're scheduled to attend with a client so telling a story this is great um you're feeling confident however when you arrive at the office your boss pulls you in her office and you need to stay on another important project so this is great this is this is a perfect story where you can imagine something like this might actually happen um there you go you have to wait you decide to write an email to find out why the meeting was canceled and rescheduled and then again you are scheduled to meet with your boss to okay so it is a little bit repetitive but we've also got 90 different intents that we can use what am I doing here we go um so let's just grab another random one to communicate with an academic advisor and detailed scenario so let's see I need to email my academic advisor for advice of what classes to take I'm not sure I'm feeling a bit lost oh this is great perfect um and because you can imagine if you're communicating with an email bot it might say like what is it that you're trying to do um so we're gonna we're gonna basically start with that brainstorm list of intents and we're going to expand them into stories um so I will go ahead and we will make a folder called stories and um we will we'll rename this file actually make sure it's saved synthesize intense yes um yes okay so we'll go ahead and close all that we'll I'll change this to synthesize stories so we'll basically use um and these background stories will be like one version of like like the input right so you're there's here's a story write the email right um so have stories and then we'll we'll also do these as lists but we're art will also start as like um uh let's see we'll just say uh lists um so we'll have stories we'll have lists and they'll all be based on these Baseline intents so we'll have lore uh stories lists uh what else did I say of Bad Emails um so we'll say we'll say messy emails um so lists stories messy emails um and those are ones that are like misspelled aggressive something like that so that'll basically be like rewrite the following email so that it's better um so actually we'll call this bullet points whoops go go back um bullet points um and then we'll have the stories so write me a story about it why this email needs to be written um and then I need a fourth and possibly a fifth category because I so typically um they say that 200 samples is the minimum however um I am finding that with some of these more complex um tasks you end up with a bad repetition um and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit one increase my sample count to 400 so double the sample count but I think I'm also going to add a stop token at the end of it because gpt3 does much better with with the stop tokens especially on these more open-ended things because without the stop token you're more likely to get the repetition um I'm gonna pause again and do a little bit of brainstorming because I need I need a fourth or fifth category one second okay figured it out um so first I've got four categories so I'm going to generate a list of bullet points so it's just like just here's a list of facts about the email here's uh conversations so the conversation is going to be between the person sending the email and the chat bot asking what kind of email do you want to send well it could be chatbot or it could be like an executive assistant um it'll be an executive assistant chatbot there you go messy emails so this is like I just hammered out an email and it's messy fix it for me and then the story so we're working on the stories first now I did a couple other things first I expanded the Baseline intents up to 100 because I want 400 samples so I was like I was at 90 I was like I just need 10 more so I added the uh the um uh neighborhood situation so like someone's dog is on the loose children running through backyards a package was delivered you know like typical stuff that you might see on a neighborhood list serve so we've got that um and then I updated uh the synthesized stories um thing so basically what I'm gonna do um oh here I can just show you real quick um so we'll do CD uh what was it um Universal that was a perfect email generator there we go um python synthesize stories and so here you go detailed scenario um or that's that's the end so this is the beginning of each one now let's add uh we'll do um we'll do slash n slash n and then a few enters sign slash n slash
