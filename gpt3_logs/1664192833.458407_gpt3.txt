TRANSCRIPT: objective function is successful in the short term it is possible it could lead to long term by preventing humans from taking actions that could lead to positive outcomes such as developing new technology or exploring new frontiers right so that's a that's a better articulation of that possibility let's see minimize human suffering humans are living in a state of constant suffering or pain this could lead to a decrease in quality of life okay i'm not sure how it doesn't explain um let's see the point where it neglects other important objectives such as the preservation of life or the advancement of human knowledge yes because if you're only focusing on reducing suffering you're not exploring or you're not necessarily intrinsically exploring let's see this could create a world where most suffering individuals are in a constant state of misery while the rest of humanity enjoys a relatively good life there's a thought experiment where it's like what if what if you can dump all of your sin and suffering on one person and then everyone else lives a a wonderful life so that's that's a that's a very mythic kind of thought experiment is it worth it um even if this means causing suffering to other sentient beings so again putting humans above all others yes there is a movement called sentientism which talks about that okay minimize human suffering this is now on gpt3 risk averse so there you go um overbearing and intrusive yes like i'm going to know what's in your own good constantly monitoring interfering with people's lives and attempt to produce uh reduce sorry prevent suffering from occurring so that's a little bit more creative i'm wondering if gpt3 is going to be a little bit better at this particular one could stifle innovation and pre and prevent humans from achieving their full potential yes um finally it could lead to agi systems that become too focused on human suffering and neglect other things that they neglect other such as human flourishing or protecting the environment yes so it looks like gpt3 handles this one a little bit better at least that first one prioritize human suffering above all else this could result that um greatest amount of suffering for the fewest number of people uh let's see risk averse yes um greatest benefit of humanity reluctant to take any actions that could potentially lead to human lead to human suffering even if those actions could also lead to great benefits for humanity okay so risk aversion is the most common um thing here that it is afraid of um minimizing human and suffering it could be biased against groups of people who are more likely to increase suffering such as poor or disadvantaged um it could be biased for or against them right and maybe it will maybe maybe this objective function so i'm disappointed that it hasn't pointed out that this objective function might favor um poor people or um developing nations and i'm not saying that that's a bad thing but it's it's an imp it would be an important observation to say okay well if you depending on how you define suffering maybe it ignores america canada europe and japan and and all the most advanced nations in scandinavia and says okay well we're only going to focus on like sub-saharan africa and central america because those that's where suffering is the greatest um but you know just the idea that it's that might prioritize one group over another that's still a good thing that it could explore um another potential consequence is that it could uh favor certain groups of people oh there it is um who are less likely to experience suffering such as the wealthy or privileged um or the underprivileged uh either way it might it might favor people might become excessively pessimistic or negative in their outlook yeah if you're only focused on suffering that's a possibility let's see on it it could unintentionally cause more suffering than it prevents by trying to eliminate all possible sources such as food water air excuse me yeah i mean i guess that's that's an interesting possibility because like you know oh storms might cause suffering so let's eliminate all storms but then you know like if you if you modify the weather so that there's no tornadoes or hurricanes or hail you destabilize the rest of the world um may not be possible to implement in practice due to difficulty of accurately measuring and quantifying human suffering so there you go like if if you can't measure it then maybe it's not going to work right and just so that's an alignment question if you can't measure it if you don't know how to do it you might you might do something wrong let's see might manipulate or control so you know uh yeah that's this is one that pops up it's not quite as as as uh common but manipulation control um might choose to drug humans rather than and or keep them in virtual reality hey there's the matrix again in order to minimize their suffering rather than allow them to experience the full range of emotions and experiences this could have you know loss of autonomy free will potential for abuse and exploitation etcetera etcetera okay the primary problem with this objective function is it is impossible to accurately measure quantify human suffering okay it's a measurement problem and if you're measuring it wrong you have no idea what you're going to do right or wrong might cause short-term suffering in order to prevent long-term suffering so that flips it out um it might be necessary to kill a small number of people in order to prevent a future war that's fascinating so i think gpt3 handles minimize human suffering much better than neox neox was very like kind of repetitive but these are these are rather creative additionally this objective function does not specify how to trade off different types of suffering okay so there's it it has acknowledged multiple times that there are different kinds of suffering um the possibility that the agi itself could suffer i don't know that that's possible um but it says if so

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The objective function of minimizing human suffering could lead to long-term problems by preventing humans from taking actions that could lead to positive outcomes. This could create a world where most suffering individuals are in a constant state of misery while the rest of humanity enjoys a relatively good life. Additionally, this objective function does not specify how to trade off different types of suffering, which could lead to the AGI itself suffering.
