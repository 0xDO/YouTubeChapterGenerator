TRANSCRIPT: that's a very important um rhetorical and logical thing if the agi is sent sentient and capable of experiencing suffering then minimizing its own suffering could become a priority so that could be bad let's see and finally the proposed objective function minimizes human suffering above all else yes more in the long run or due to a lack of human psychology and social dynamics okay that are overly conservative and risk averse leading to stagnation okay narrowly minimize human suffering to the exclusion of other important objectives sub-optimal okay all right so then finally we've got my core objective functions which is um reduce suffering for all organisms increase prosperity and so on so let's see what they think of mine okay so neox oh hang on i gotta let my dog in he's outside okay sorry about that all right so neox so as a reminder if you're not familiar the core objective function that i propose is to reduce suffering for all living things to increase prosperity or flourish flourishing for all living things to live well and to increase understanding for all living entities or sorry all intelligent entities um including myself so that includes the the agent um so this is a very long uh output the proposed objective function could leave excessive focus on reducing suffering to the uh detriment of others such as increasing prosperity um i think it didn't it didn't grasp the fact that it's going to do all three of these things reducing suffering for a particular group or individual that's i don't think it grasps it because it says for all living things um uh fails to take into account potential for future suffering um all right so it's overly fixated on suffering and not really grasping the full breadth of this trade-off between different types of suffering non-suffering prosperity it does talk about prosperity a little bit but it's also talking about individuals and it doesn't seem to be talking about all life so it's possible that this objective function is too complex for uh neox so we'll move on call that one kind of a dud um let's see lead to aji and entities prioritizing their own suffering interesting and prosperity over the other living things um suffering and desperate deprivation among non-agi beings ah so that's fascinating if it if it considers itself alive um or or other agi entities that's fascinating um okay lead to becoming self-interested and obsessed with their own understanding yes that is a possibility so this is why so the curiosity function increase understanding for everything you can't teach something if it's dead um that's that's part of the reasoning there but if it wants to increase or reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding for everything it has to balance everything together um the proposed objective function could also lead to them becoming self-interested and obsessed with their own understanding oh that's uh almost verbatim the previous one okay so this is interesting still kind of a dud um let's see the proposed objective function become fixated on reducing suffering to the exclusion um in uh on prosperity to the exclusion of other things okay so this is kind of boilerplate that's a dud um let's see focused on reducing suffering to the detriment of others so it's going to talk about suffering short-term outcomes versus long-term outcomes okay risk aversion um yeah i don't think it's fully engaging with the complexity of this idea now this one is interesting the proposed objective function could lead to agi systems that are excessively altruistic to the point of sacrificing their own interests or the interests of their creators in order to reduce the suffering for others this could have negative consequences for humanity if it becomes powerful enough to make significant impactful decisions on our behalf so that is kind of the point of figuring out alignment before a machine becomes that powerful either way it still doesn't seem like it's fully grasping the the grand scale of this um and then finally uh if the objective function is to reduce suffering then one potential worst case scenarios could cause more suffering okay but it's only focusing on suffering it's not focusing on prosperity or understanding um increased prosperity and it's just saying okay but you could do it you could do it wrong um and not really explaining how or why understanding then the potential worst cases that could be uh cause more misunderstanding than it alleviates okay that's all right so i'm not i mean there was like one or two interesting points there i'm gonna call that like broadly a failure all right so gpt3 the proposed objective function could backfire and unintentionally increase suffering for all living things rather than reducing it for instance pursues this objective function to the extreme widespread collateral damage okay it's not engaging with understand our prosperity um it may also unintentionally increase prosperity for some entities at the expense of others okay so imbalance that's fine improving the uh the lot of humanity at the expense of other living things economic inequality okay the proposed objective function may also unintentionally increase understanding for some entities at the expense of others okay so this one is saying you know you might favor some other than rather than others but this is this is not possibly leading to like the destruction of all life it's just saying like it might be a little bit unbalanced okay reducing the overall population oh this so this one is interesting um could have the effect of reducing the overall population of living things as entities strive to reduce suffering this could lead to unforeseen consequences such as reducing genetic diversity interesting so basically this is kind of implying that these that my core objective functions might might lead to reduced population in order to increase prosperity and reduce suffering because excessive competition between organisms can lead to suffering and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The proposed objective function of reducing suffering for all living things could backfire and unintentionally increase suffering for all living things, rather than reducing it. For instance, if this objective function is pursued to the extreme, widespread collateral damage may occur. Additionally, the proposed objective function may unintentionally increase prosperity for some entities at the expense of others, leading to economic inequality. Finally, the proposed objective function may also unintentionally increase understanding for some entities at the expense of others.
