0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:20:58.800,0:21:03.720
enjoying things okay let's see what it says
about how these things link it says okay and
0:21:03.720,0:21:10.740
the example I provide did I use ID property for
example in the following snippet so it does that
0:21:10.740,0:21:20.760
the nationality property is set to ID of France oh
okay okay so the net this this is the connection
0:21:22.560,0:21:25.140
so if you're if you're referring to another thing
0:21:26.880,0:21:32.400
got it so nationality is like a property so the
the properties that are attached to each node
0:21:32.400,0:21:39.240
are arbitrary and then you can also just have one
connect back to another got it got it okay cool
0:21:41.760,0:21:49.620
I wonder if we can just have gpt3 rewrite this
as a knowledge as a Json LD Knowledge Graph if
0:21:49.620,0:22:01.140
chat if chat GPT um knows this knows it this
well um and and text DaVinci 03 is also the same
0:22:01.140,0:22:09.780
underlying model GPT 3.5 it's entirely possible
this will work um okay uh let's see convert
0:22:10.320,0:22:22.200
the following um scotus opinion document
into a Json LD formatted um Knowledge Graph
0:22:24.060,0:22:29.100
and then we'll add some vertical white space
just to be friendly to the thing and we'll
0:22:29.100,0:22:34.500
come down to let's see it's just a little
bit too long let's cut this roughly in half
0:22:35.340,0:22:45.180
so start let's see new page so in addition
Ace acts so blah blah okay so let's
0:22:47.220,0:22:53.580
oops come back just save that there and then
we'll give it some more vertical white space
0:22:54.780,0:23:05.700
um and then we'll do um uh Json LD uh Knowledge
Graph okay cool also one thing that I have
0:23:05.700,0:23:11.700
discovered is I actually prefer to turn the
temperature down lately and the reason is
0:23:11.700,0:23:19.140
because I found that um you're especially the
the most recent ones the instruct aligned ones
0:23:20.160,0:23:25.320
um they do almost exactly what you want and so
with a temperature of zero you get really good
0:23:25.320,0:23:31.680
consistent results um so I have changed my default
temperature to zero um you know and everything
0:23:31.680,0:23:37.440
else just zero zero zero it's it's pretty
well aligned okay so let's see if this works
0:23:52.140,0:23:54.180
um it looks like it's going
to do like the whole thing
0:24:02.820,0:24:09.480
vehicle true vehicle vehicle okay so that's
not quite what I had in mind what I was
0:24:09.480,0:24:17.460
hoping is that it would break down the um the
other the what I want is the opinions and the
0:24:17.460,0:24:22.560
um and what do you call these like where
you where you reference something right so
0:24:24.240,0:24:31.860
um let's give it a little bit more instructions
about what I want um specifically uh um
0:24:34.680,0:24:47.760
uh let's see let's see yeah uh focus on
dates decisions opinions um and reasoning uh
0:24:50.100,0:25:01.440
the purpose of this knowledge graph is to be
searchable uh by lawyers for um legal precedent
0:25:02.940,0:25:12.060
and case law um and let's say let's say
specifically by trial lawyers so this is basically
0:25:12.060,0:25:18.480
I'm telling it this is a research tool here I'll
just tell it this is a research tool for preparing
0:25:18.480,0:25:27.300
for um trials before The Supreme Court I'm just
trying like what would Devin say on legal eagle
0:25:28.380,0:25:37.200
um okay so let's try this again and see if
this changes a little bit about how it composes
0:25:37.800,0:25:42.060
um this this thing decision
opinion reasoning excellent
0:25:48.240,0:25:50.760
opinion and the circumstances requires no
0:25:50.760,0:25:52.980
more formal legal distinction
between person and Enterprise
0:25:55.140,0:26:03.660
um okay that's interesting um it's
still not quite I'm still missing
0:26:03.660,0:26:07.980
something what is it that I want from
this maybe maybe we can't go straight to
0:26:09.000,0:26:13.980
um to this hang on I think someone's moving around
let me uh close my door I'll be right back in a
0:26:13.980,0:26:20.340
second okay sorry about that so it's it's breaking
it down into one thing but what up like I guess I
0:26:20.340,0:26:28.800
need to think what nodes do I want out of this
um and then you know so each node will be um
0:26:35.280,0:26:38.100
well here let me let me go ahead and
save this prompt because it's pretty good
