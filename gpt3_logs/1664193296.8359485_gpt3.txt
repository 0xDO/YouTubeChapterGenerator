TRANSCRIPT: good morning everybody well afternoon evening whatever time it happens to be for you when you watch this my name is david shapiro and i'm back with another episode about raven raven agi in this case i'm working on raven's encyclopedic service now what the encyclopedia service does is it provides raven with basically facts it's what raven knows about the world for certain the reason that raven needs this even with a tool as powerful as something like gpt3 is that gpt3 doesn't really know what's true and this is this is true of pretty much any generative model right a generative model takes input and kind of just runs with it that's all it does it's just an intuition machine so what you need then is you need something that you say yes this is a set of facts that i believe in strongly so that's what this is um is i've got it running in the background i'm running it against uh the simple the simple english wikipedia because it's much smaller let me show you about that real quick um so the full wikipedia as of april 1st compressed was about 18 19 gigabytes uncompressed it's about just shy of 81 gigabytes but the simple english wikipedia is much smaller just under one gigabyte and then you can see here i took a four 4.2 megabyte subset to test on um and so basically what that means is that the simple wikipedia is one it's it's in it's in simpler english which you know great but also it's just smaller so it's a complete subset of an english encyclopedia so without further ado let me introduce you to this project so what it's doing now is it's actually going through and parsing out all of the all of the the articles into plain english and the reason it has to do that is because here let me just show you by itself it is uh it's pretty messy so this is what wikipedia looks like behind the scenes um you see there's some there's some formatting that's familiar but a lot of it see like these double square brackets that's actually a link right and so well with an offline dictionary or sorry offline encyclopedia i don't want links this is just supposed to be a text document so it's chock full of all kinds of formatting that we don't want that i don't want to feed raven i don't want to give raven xml or html or wiki markup i want to give raven plain text so i had to write some scripts to just clean all this up and just extract the base you know the the actual stuff from it so then what the ultimate uh what i ultimately came up with was this so this is what it looks like in json format and you can see that uh that it's it's not perfect but it's much better and this might actually not even be the last one because it still has categories in it but either way i removed the vast majority of the links and cleaned it up so that you can just read it it's not meant to be rendered in a web page you just you just read it yeah this isn't the last one because it still has it also has links okay so anyways this was this was the work in progress now for the final script you can see it's still running um actually some some fun backstory when i ran this a previous version of this script against the full wikipedia it took about 18 hours to run so so yeah or maybe maybe it was eight anyways it was a long time i could make this faster by by making it multi-threaded because looking at my cpu resources this is not taking a whole lot of resources it's doing individual transactions with a sqlite database is not a heavy workload and it's also just some basic regex which you'll see in a second okay so sorry digression now without further ado here is the actual script so we've got here's the file name i showed you the xml file i think this xml file is about 17 million lines long and it so this is an export of of the simple english wikipedia in a single file it's crazy [Music] but there you have it i see i probably don't need that anymore so i start with article equals an empty string i could probably do a string literal whatever i create a database connection to sql lite3 i'm called simplewiki dot sqlite i get the cursor and then i run start db so this function it does create table if not exists and so basically if you have to run this multiple times you don't want to try and create it the same table over and over again so this just says if it doesn't exist create the table wiki um give it uh these three fields so title article and id and ensure that the id is unique so when you set a unique flag on a on a sql database it just says it guarantees that every value is going to be unique in that particular column and that allows you to ensure that you you don't get duplicates it's the simplest way to ensure you don't get duplicates there is one thing that you need to do to to prevent errors later on and i'll show you that and then what i've got is create index if not exists title underscore idx on wiki title so what that tells the database to do is to take the title column that field and create an index of it and what that does is uh it create i'm not sure i think what was it see i looked it up sqlite uses a b tree index um and i'm not exactly sure what that means but basically uh what an index does is uh it makes it so that it's easier to search that column and so when you do that it's it says uh let we're going to create another column that helps us find if you search for a title it'll help you find it faster and so that may that means that the database will actually you'll get way better search speeds if you do uh if you do a query such as where did it go i actually don't have a query in this um in this script um so i haven't tested the search speed yet um and you see here i've got commented out doing the same thing creating an index if not exists on okay and we're back sorry about that um had a little bit of a technical glitch so still running uh i left off where i was just telling you about the article index uh the thing about the article index is that it basically doubles the size of the database so we'll see how big it gets um
