The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: distance yeah it didn't it didn't actually remove repetition ah let's see i wonder if what if i just say remove repetitiveness remove repetition if present we're on temperature 0.7 so it's allowed to be creative yeah okay i need to do a little bit more let me do a time check we're at 14 minutes okay i'm trying to keep it to 30 minutes um [Music] yeah so this is a good example of like we need to summarize this as like the new world state right um i wonder if we can oh i got an idea i got an idea so the event that's fine the state change um so let's let's change this from new state um to change uh let's see so we'll say it's state change um given the following world state and event advance the world state now um let's say describe the state change in detail um detail what has changed in the world state i wonder if that will be good um okay so and then let's also change the name of that um because we need we need to kind of go ahead and fix this so it'll be event change and then we'll call this state and that'll say no we'll leave that so the reason i'm doing that now is because you want to you want to keep everything nice and consistent so because we've got event change and state right we've got those three things and so we'll true up so we've got event change and state see that's that's the names that i gave it so we'll make sure that we've got got them in the same here event change and state and then we also got to change this so change and state actually let me go ahead and do a get status get add you get commit am stashing work in case i break it bad push um [Music] i know you're not supposed to use git well i guess git is version control so i had something that's working so now it's time to experiment um okay so we got the event this seems like it's okay um sometimes it gets a little bit long but that's okay uh so world state state change um and then we say uh so then we'll instead of this we'll say um state change so we'll change the name of that and then we'll say um write a new world state um and complete um the same no describe the new world state um completely and so then we'll say new world state and actually we can probably just call this like change um because i don't i don't want to confuse it because i want to say like world state and new world state and if i do state change that might confuse it because it's like oh because you know sometimes it was describing the same thing twice um where like the event and then the change would be nearly identical so we don't want that okay write a new world state describe the world new world state completely and this would absolutely benefit from fine tuning so i might do that offline and then do another video showing like fine-tuning a world simulator um okay let's test this i think this is good enough python test make sure i didn't break anything the men get into another fist fight they're ordered to stay away from each other looks like it's doing the same damn thing oh okay i wonder if if it's kind of stuck in a loop because i made it too concise um so here's what i'll do i'll do we'll do a folder call it backup and we'll go here and we'll just take everything after that long one and we'll move it over to backup so now we'll start with a larger world state so that we can see what it does if it's got more detail because what i think is happening is that it's it doesn't have enough um write a detailed new world state describe the new world state completely okay so let's try this because i want it to actually like be generative be very creative okay event there we go change okay he talks to a young woman standing next to a young woman on the bench okay it seems like it's still kind of becoming more and more concise okay that's not how i want you to behave let's come here and turn up the temperature um because i'm wondering if the low temperature is causing it to kind of like just i don't know give me just a little bit um so the event um state change um let's see given the following action event describe um actually no let's describe the impact um describe the impact in detail write a thorough explanation of what has changed in the world and then we'll just take that and call it change this is a text based simulation this is a text based simulation oh let's add that back in i wonder if this helps this is the text based simulation right in detailed world state um let's see this might be too short given the world state event and change um let's see simulate a new world uh uh let's see simulate a new world actually no we'll say describe the new world state in great detail uh let's see describe the new world state in great detail and then um well that's that's fine we changed we changed quite a bit okay so we've got state event change world state event change new world state so let's try that cls the woman returns the bench and sits next to the man since the woman oh there we go it seems the two of them have reconciled this is a change from the previous world state oh good good good sitting next to man the man looks happy to have her near him the woman and the man smile and hold hands okay that was quick um this world state is still not quite a loving embrace okay it's just assuming that they were lovers or something this is starting to look a little bit more like um uh this is starting to look a little bit more like dungeon um what is it ai dungeon so it's just confabulating stuff and it's not keeping track of stuff they share a long passion okay this is getting a little r-rated um hmm so this world state is not keeping track enough of what was going on in the past um yeah because if we look at the state like it's it's only it's describing it too succinctly um it's almost like i still need to it's almost like we need to we need to kind of keep something well no because this prompt state should it should merge everything together um retain relevant details from the original world state such that the new world state um still makes sense and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to create a new, more detailed world state, we must first consider the event that has occurred and the impact it has had. To do this, we must describe the state change in detail, detailing what has changed in the world state as a result of the event. We must also change the name of the event to something more descriptive, such as "state change", in order to avoid confusion. Finally, we must write a new world state, describing the world in its new state completely.
