The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: long time I will say that if you own the data if the data stays on-prem and doesn't ever go up to another vendor it is a lot easier to get certified for privacy and security Now that means that you have responsibility to keep that data secure and private but there's other you know there's if you're a publicly traded company there's sarbanes-oxley there's lots of companies that do socks auditing just because it is a good standard to have there's a surprising number of private companies that are not required to do sarbanes-oxley auditing that do it anyways anyways so the just taking a tangent thinking about this from a business perspective um the combination of end 8 distillation and and uh hopefully a surplus of good GPU Hardware means that we'll be able to start running some of these locally you know um building local inference servers before too long obviously you know something as big and powerful as Bloom um even if it's 170 175 gigabytes of RAM um so what's that that's about 24 per GPU so that's four so that's still eight 24 gigabyte gpus um so that's still going to be pricey um I think that's probably what if you get used it's still probably about 10 grand right now um but that's going to be state of the art uh open source model now you won't have enough to fine tune it so it usually takes like what someone correct me if I'm wrong but it usually takes like 4X to 10x the amount of memory to fine-tune a model so you know we're we're still a little ways off but you know a couple more years and it'll be reasonable also as the cost of the hardware the capital investment comes down more and more companies are going to be able to offer fine-tuning services so say for instance you have a data set and you want to get Bloom fine-tuned and you then you want to you want to own it right so rather than rather than go and upload your data to a web interface and then they host your fine tune model they'll just give it to you right um so you can do fine tuning as a service and then you can then they can probably just sell you fine-tuned models right I know that from day one at open AI people were asking about sharing and selling fine-tuned models because there are independent uh consultants and small companies and startups that they just want to do bespoke fine-tuning models where that's like okay I fine-tuned this model now I'll sell it as a service you know for whatever whatever tasks whether it's legal inference medical summarization who knows who cares right um so there's there's this demand to release models now this is all language models so this takes me to this article that uh my fiance sent me um and so this is kind of this was the inspiration for today's uh today's episode like how did we get here and where are we going so AI art has been nothing short of um is is uh nothing short of like one it's it's impressive but it's also very controversial um so there's already been cases of of um you know people submitting AI art and it winning Awards or um of of art hosts uh Banning it and so then one of the most popular prompts uh one of is to use Greg Rakowski um and so like he is technically like people are using his name to generate art um I I read this article it's it's kind of boilerplate if you're familiar with uh with what's going on but it was it was good inspiration um and and it talks about how amongst other things um the the Leon um data set so there's uh let's see where is it Leon is the um the Leon 5B is the data set that was used to train it and it may or may not have been like ethically built but here's the other thing is it crosses International borders right so um you know uh IP laws in one nation might not apply the same that they do in another nation and then once you train a model like in Germany or America and the data was gathered in Germany or America and then the model goes somewhere else it's really confusing um now that's not to say that International IP laws have not been worked on for decades they have um I I pursued getting a patent uh many years ago and um you know basically it just cost 10 times as much to get you know International protection for your IP um and you know okay but you know is this a derivative work because when you when you look at existing um uh uh precedent legal precedent and jurisprudence you know because you're allowed to create something as long as you are adding value and creating something new so it's called a derivative work and by no means am I an expert on this this is just my you know like uh my my hot take so to me it seems like you you use one bit of data to train another and so writers writers know this um there are many writers who actually will refuse to read other works of fiction while they're working on their own fiction because you can't help but do neural style transfer when you're um when you're reading something and then and then producing your own work because your brain is primed with that information but the thing is it takes human work to do that and the same is true if you're looking at other artists and you're kind of like you know what looking at their art and then like oh I can do that or getting some inspiration from it um I had a I had a peace commissioned and I pulled from two dozen different artists and I I said Okay I want something that's like this this this and this and I paid for it um and but this other artist even though you know I gave I gave them some inspiration from other works of art they still put in you know a few dozen hours or however long it took them of their own work to make something new and unique so what happens when all of that work to derive a new work is done by a machine and all the human has to do is you know spend 30 seconds writing a prompt um is that the same and who knows I'm not going to try and litigate this this is this is obviously going to come down to probably some Landmark Supreme Court cases it's going to come down to um uh probably actually uh International Trade policy I

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The question of whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) can create art has been a controversial one. Some believe that AI art is impressive, while others argue that it is unethical. There have been cases of AI art winning awards or being banned by art hosts.

One of the most popular prompts for AI art is to use Greg Rakowski's name. Rakowski is a Polish artist whose work often features nude women. However, the use of his name to generate art has been controversial, as some believe it is unethical.

The Leon 5B data set, which was used to train AI art, may or may not have been ethically built. This is because it crosses international borders, and different countries have different laws regarding data and intellectual property.

Ultimately, the question of whether or not AI can create art is a complex one. There are many factors to consider, including the ethics of using AI to generate art and the legal implications of doing so.
