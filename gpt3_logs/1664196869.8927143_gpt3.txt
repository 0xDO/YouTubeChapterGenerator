TRANSCRIPT: stoicism among academics and the general public alike this is likely due to the fact that stoic philosophy offers a practical and down-to-earth approach with dealing with the challenges of life okay you know nothing wrong with that how did the french revolution influence stoicism in britain let's see the french revolution had a profound impact on stoicism in britain the events of the revolution such as the storming of the bastille and the execution of king louis xvi showed the british people that it was possible to overthrow an unjust government the french revolution also inspired british stoics to develop their own philosophy of government they believed that the best form of government was one that allowed the individual to pursue their own happiness without interference from the state the british stokes were also influenced by the writings of jean-jacques rousseau who argued that the state should exist to serve the people not the other way around russo's idea was ideas were very influential on the british stoics and helped to shape their thinking on government and politics so you can see that that uh you know about 200 years ago um wait 150 years ago or so when did the hang on i have this thing right here when did the french revolution happen i don't need to guess 1789 okay so just over 200 years ago um this is when this was all happening and so in the recent history because remember uh this is shortly after the founding of america and america and um and france were great allies um describe the alliance between america and france at that time um in 1778 the american colonies formed an alliance with france against the britain against britain during the revolutionary war the french provided financial and military support to the americans which was crucial in helping to win to win the war after the war uh the relationship became much closer the two countries remained allies during the french revolution and napoleonic wars america also supported france during the franco-prussian war in 1870. okay so there's a close alliance here there's also so there's this like three-way cultural affinity between america britain and france um and so stoicism which was really important at the time is still to still in effect today now when you look at you know toxic masculinity toxic stoicism this idea that emotions should be suppressed that's where you get into problems okay so we've established what stoicism is and toxic stoicism okay write a formal definition of toxic stoicism toxic stoicism is an unhealthy okay holding in emotions rather than expressing them resentment bottled up emotions and difficulty in relationships great okay so if that is our definition of toxic stoicism how can we express emotions in a healthy manner that is also consistent with stoicism there is no one answer to this question as different people have different ways of expressing emotions that work for them however some suggestions for healthy ways to express emotions include talking to a trusted friend or family member journaling or participating in therapy that's great but the underlying problem is that if you're hostile to your emotions or deny that you have emotions it's really difficult to get in touch with them um so what if someone has suppressed their emotions to the point they are no longer in touch with them um a clinical term this is called dissociation in other words someone has uh dissociated from their emotions what should they do if someone has dissociated from their emotions it is important to seek professional help this is because dissociating from emotions can be a sign of more serious mental health issues such as ptsd that is true however you do not need ptsd to dissociate from from any emotion or sensation i have a good friend who's a physical therapist who will talk about dissociation from pain so let's let's talk about that real quick so that you understand what i mean by dissociation so your brain has the ability to compartmentalize um and minimize uh sensation so what is dissociation from the perspective of sports medicine um let's see dissociation is a process where an athlete mentally disconnects from the current situation in order to cope that's close loss of consciousness what about pain can someone dissociate from a sports injury there is evidence that dissociation can help athletes cope with pain in one study runners who dissociated from the pain of running display displayed less pain and exhaustion than those who did not dissociate however it is important to note that dissociation should not be used in a way to ignore pain or injuries doing so could lead to further injury this is true this is what my physical therapist friend was talking about if you have a chronic injury that you learn to ignore and you just keep running on it or whatever you'll hurt it more hard at worse okay what is this similarity between dissociation compartmentalization and minimization i made another video about some of these topics that was really popular there is some overlap between dissociation compartmentalization and minimization all three involve disconnecting from the current situation in order to cope however dissociation is more likely to involve a complete loss of consciousness while compartmentalization and minimization are more likely to involve keeping certain thoughts or feelings at a distance okay so what if someone believes in stoicism and minimizes their emotions what would this be called and what can they whoops what can they do about it there's no one right answer this question some people might see stoicism as a form of dissociation while others might see it as a form of compartmentalization or minimization okay it's starting to repeat itself the important thing is that whatever coping strategy someone is using it is effective for them if someone is finding that their emotions are causing them to stress they might may want to explore other coping strategies okay this is getting kind of generic i think

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The French Revolution had a profound impact on stoicism in Britain. The events of the revolution such as the storming of the bastille and the execution of king louis xvi showed the British people that it was possible to overthrow an unjust government. The French Revolution also inspired British stoics to develop their own philosophy of government. They believed that the best form of government was one that allowed the individual to pursue their own happiness without interference from the state. The British stoics were also influenced by the writings of jean-jacques rousseau who argued that the state should exist to serve the people not the other way around. Russo's idea was very influential on the British stoics and helped to shape their thinking on government and politics.

Toxic stoicism is an unhealthy holding in of emotions rather than expressing them. This can lead to resentment, bottled up emotions, and difficulty in relationships. If someone has suppressed their emotions to the point they are no longer in touch with them, it is important to seek professional help. This is because dissociating from emotions can be a sign of more serious mental health issues such as PTSD. However, you do not need PTSD to dissociate from any emotion or sensation.

There is no one answer to the question of how to express emotions in a healthy manner that is also consistent with stoicism. Different people have different ways of expressing emotions that work for them. However, some suggestions for healthy ways to express emotions include talking to a trusted friend or family member, journaling, or participating in therapy.
