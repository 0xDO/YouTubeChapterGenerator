TRANSCRIPT: every phenomenon in the universe arises from matter and energy that's what materialism says if that's true if materialism is true then our consciousness arises from the matter of our brain and the energy therein but that just means that consciousness is a matter of biochemical calculation which in theory anything with a sufficient amount of biochemical calculation could therefore be conscious and if biochemical calculation is enough to create consciousness then what about silicon based computation could a silicon thing you know could a computer be conscious or a tree or a mushroom or a whole forest right if biochemical biochemical computation is the only thing required for consciousness as you know implied by materialism then anything could be conscious whether or not it's made of organic matter now um there's no like okay so what what gives rise to our subjective experience though like at what point does something go from like you know an inert nail file to something that has eyes and a subjective experience of what it's like to be um and there lies the question uh and this of course became a big big hullabaloo a few months ago when uh that uh when when that google engineer claimed that lambda was sentient and of course like it was designed to model human conversation so of course it said it was sentient like a human is never going to say i am not sentient i mean i could type that into chat but it would be a lie okay let's see let me scroll up because uh some questions have have uh come on all right um for species yes that's what i was on speaking of extraterrestrials there is also the current uap slash ufo phenomenon that congress has been tasked to investigate based on some military footage of unidentified objects yes that keeps coming in cycles though um it almost feels like um you know the us military congress are just like setting the stage to release something later on i don't know um thing is like i think the way that someone said it on one of these press releases was pretty um they said like okay like yes even the air force says that 99.8 of all reports are can be explained by drones airplanes you know natural phenomenon whatever but they they acknowledge that there are you know two percent or point two percent or however many that um cannot be explained um and you know there are more and more pilots and former astronauts and all kinds of people coming forward saying yeah i've seen a whole bunch of stuff that i can't explain and that we were we were told not to ever talk about um but you know they're talking about it so either they're lying um which is always a possibility like you know people want their 15 minutes of fame um so either they're lying they're exaggerating or they're telling the truth in part or in whole but the thing is is it is a leap to go from and as much as i want to believe that there's aliens and super advanced you know god-like entities out there um my rational scientific brain is like okay occam's razor though like there might be a simpler explanation so like um i think it was on the lex friedman podcast he was in he was uh interviewing a major of the air force who had retired but they were saying that they were training off the coast of washington dc and for like eight days or something there were like um there were unidentified aircraft out there or you know unidentified objects um that that they they couldn't explain um and then they went away and they're like okay so he he was talking about it from a military perspective which is okay let's assume that they are military aircraft and that they're spying on us right which is if if you're trained in military intelligence that's what you're going to immediately assume and then you'd be worried because it's like okay someone has drones out here that that or other aircraft that we don't know who put them there and it could have been our own people right like let's just as a thought experiment let's imagine that these are human-made craft of some sort and so there's a whole bunch of drones out there that are watching u.s air force plane pilots do maneuvers who put them there it could be nsa it could be cia it could be adversaries it could be north korea for all we know probably not because they don't have that great of an economy also probably not russia because their economy is the size of texas well less now because of sanctions um but yeah so so who put it there right but you can always reach for a magic answer right and and again this is as much as i love magical explanations my rational brain is like yeah but it would be real embarrassing if you reach for the magic answer and it's something mundane but so the magic answer is there's super advanced aliens out there that are watching us because they're trying to like police us and make sure we don't blow ourselves off the face of the planet there are stories about that so i saw one documentary years ago where a um a general or someone or reportedly saw a video of a um of a ufo like like basically laser the um the warhead out of the tip of a missile and and he was like what what the hell are you doing like and they're like that wasn't us um it's hearsay right it was on probably history channels so who knows if it was real anyways so yeah there's always the possibility of of ufos uaps so on and so forth but it goes back to what is the fundamental nature of reality if the grand biocentric design is true then the universe was in superposition until it found earth in the quantum field the universal um quantum wave function of reality and created earth in order to have conscious life so that's also called the strong anthropic principle which is the observation that the universe seems finely calibrated to create us here um so grand buyer essentially i'll put that in chat um grand biocentric design and or um strong and thorough principle okay so let me go back up got some more questions all right old zany presume we perfectly align agi and we reach a stable utopia

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

According to materialism, every phenomenon in the universe arises from matter and energy. This means that our consciousness arises from the matter and energy of our brain. But this also means that consciousness is simply a matter of biochemical calculation. In theory, anything with sufficient biochemical calculation could be conscious. This raises the question of whether or not silicon-based computation could create consciousness. If biochemical computation is all that is required for consciousness, then anything could be conscious, regardless of whether or not it is made of organic matter.

This question became a big issue a few months ago when a Google engineer claimed that a computer program called Lambda was sentient. Of course, Lambda was designed to model human conversation, so it is not surprising that it would say it was sentient. However, this raises the question of at what point does something go from being an inert object to something that has eyes and a subjective experience of what it is like to be.

There is also the current phenomenon of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Congress has been tasked with investigating this phenomenon based on military footage of unidentified objects. Some people believe that these objects are actually military aircraft that are being used to spy on us. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.

It is always possible that there is a simpler explanation for the UFO phenomenon. For example, it could be that the objects are actually drones or airplanes. Or it could be that they are natural phenomena that have not yet been explained. Until there is more evidence, it is premature to say definitively what is causing the UFO phenomenon.
