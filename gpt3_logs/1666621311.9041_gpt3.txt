0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:40:58.320,0:41:05.220
execution engine which also incorporates both
execution I will explain it in a moment and
0:41:05.220,0:41:12.960
language for writing translators now for proof
of execution that's something that we walk on
0:41:15.360,0:41:22.320
if if I if you give me a program you ask me to
run the program let's let's say the program we
0:41:22.320,0:41:27.720
can say so no let's say um so I come back
to you I tell you the program returned yes
0:41:28.500,0:41:33.540
how do you know I didn't make it up how
do you know I really end the program
0:41:39.120,0:41:44.580
in absolute sense there is no way
to convince accept something that
0:41:44.580,0:41:47.040
is equivalent for you running
the program yourself again
0:41:48.540,0:41:56.520
but then what's the point then we could just run
it without giving it away turns out that other
0:41:56.520,0:42:04.500
under cryptographic assumptions I can give you
a cryptographic proof that dialing was correct
0:42:05.340,0:42:09.900
the cryptographic means it's not a logical
proof but it is a very hard to fake
0:42:12.480,0:42:16.800
so why don't you say that everywhere
0:42:17.340,0:42:25.680
why you cannot write now give program to other
people and get a cryptographic certificate well
0:42:26.340,0:42:33.840
because it requires to convert the program into
a very specific form and that's a big headache
0:42:35.580,0:42:42.600
and in tml because it is converted to the binary
decision diagram form it is already in the form
0:42:42.600,0:42:49.140
that suits this kind of algorithm so for tml
program you are able to give a short certificate
0:42:50.400,0:42:59.700
and this gives rise to important blockchain
feature foreign existing blockchain networks with
0:42:59.700,0:43:07.200
smart contracts um all nodes in the network need
to earn the smart contracts as part of the block
0:43:07.200,0:43:15.300
verification process so the computational capacity
of the whole network is as of one home computer
0:43:17.340,0:43:25.560
and all the work is repeated why not one node
runs the contracts and supplies proof to the
0:43:25.560,0:43:31.980
other nodes that this is the correct answer
and that's indeed yet another aspect of how
0:43:33.240,0:43:37.140
the proof of execution of contracts all
things in or other things in general
0:43:40.140,0:43:48.240
and so the town metal language is what enables
this distribution of not just computation but
0:43:48.240,0:43:55.080
also the proofs um and then and that that
relates to the logic and the trust so uh
0:43:55.080,0:43:59.880
Professor franconi earlier you mentioned
how do you how do you trust right how do
0:43:59.880,0:44:06.180
you how do you arrive at that uh at that place
where there's agreement um and that's that's a
0:44:06.180,0:44:14.220
bit of what Ohad is mentioning what is what
is your uh your take or uh reaction to some
0:44:14.220,0:44:18.300
of those some of the solutions that you guys
have come up with with the Tao meta language
0:44:19.440,0:44:29.940
uh well if I can go back with other examples or
I'd mentioned SQL and tml an assembling SQL and
0:44:29.940,0:44:39.660
based with uh this very powerful data structures
Etc so SQL database technology is basically
0:44:42.000,0:44:50.340
making a business of 17 percent of all ID so
70 of all ID money goes to relational database
0:44:50.340,0:45:00.120
technology that's what companies do that's what is
really needed and Banks use SQL Technologies and
0:45:00.120,0:45:07.380
and Banks don't want their technology to fail they
want their systems to always tell the truth about
0:45:07.380,0:45:11.640
how much money do they have and how much money do
they have to give to other people and so on and
0:45:11.640,0:45:19.020
so forth transaction have to be transferred now
SQL is based on logic so SQL technology is logic
0:45:19.020,0:45:28.620
it's personal logic is when it was created in the
early 70s it was created as a formal system and
0:45:28.620,0:45:33.660
SQL is a language where you can actually access
the data and update the data and manage the data
0:45:34.260,0:45:41.220
and it's all based on on the notion that the
answer is always to any query or the impact of
0:45:41.220,0:45:46.200
any update the data is always trustable because
there are formal proofs mathematical proofs that
0:45:46.200,0:45:53.100
tells you that that's one aspect and well I have
this joke they always make that even Microsoft
0:45:53.100,0:46:00.000
but these are a joke that is good for people of my
age when Microsoft was just a nightmare right with
