TRANSCRIPT: relief from ill-being um she built up to that assertion um after a long chapter of basically saying like what is the purpose of a nervous system um and that is like we sense injuries nociception to take care of ourselves because if we don't do that we die and we don't pass on our genes and so then she goes on to talk about okay what does it mean to care about yourself what does it mean to care about others and so she's building this case about like where does our morality come from it is an excellent excellent book i am 60 pages in out of just about uh let's see that's all in appendices 180 so i'm a third of the way through um phenomenal book uh could not recommend enough if you want to research alignment and agi read this book also it supports my work um what she just said about the brain being organized to seek well-being or aka increased prosperity and avoid or reduce ill-being or reduce suffering i'm not alone like i said in all my videos i'm not making this stuff up all of my work is biomimetic so yes read this book um someone recommended this book how emotions are made um it's really dry it's also super dense look at look at just how much like the how small the print is and it is well that's all notes um it's still over 300 pages of text um yeah so this is super dense this i thought that this was gonna help me with the morality thing but that's when i found this book um so this is still good it's still valuable information but it's very dry it's it takes a while to get through um i started reading innate so i've told you guys about this one before um [Music] this one now that i've started reading it it's kind of boring um it's mostly like if you're familiar with statistical psychology like this is mostly distribution charts and um and standard deviations in terms of like statistics about how people behave at least as far as i've gotten into it so i've been on the internet for a long time and i've read psychology today and and other stuff so most of this was not surprising if you're not familiar with you know um sociology and statistical psychology and some of the basics of like um like twin studies and stuff um this will this will be good for you but for me it's like just review um let's see someone asked a question where was it um oh yeah here we go so thunder and storm you said after or before planning and implications so what he's he or she is referring to here is um in the inner loop when we say like what are the long-term impacts here um in uh like so this is this is all part of the inner loop um uh does the robot evaluate its resources for the actions to take like what can i do am i a car so it has to have a sense of self so part of this is going to be defined um one it's going to be explored by the by by the machine um but let's see what precious time okay so there's a few few things here one the actions so that all that all goes into the outer loop so this is this is analogous to proprioception which is the sense of your body in space and time there's interoception which is the sense of your internal structure like i know that i have an arm i can feel it my brain knows that i have this thing that i can use so that's proprioception and enteroception and then sensing injuries is nociception um and so you know like let's say for instance one of the services in our acog stops we need to be able to sense that because that is analogous to an injury so thunder and storm the answer one of the answers to your question is that we're going to add proprioception and terraception and nociception to the machine no ceception might actually be in the inner loop i'm not sure yet and then also resource constraints so time energy materials like what do i actually have access to this is all technically so for task and cognitive tasks this is technically um part of the outer loop and so like i named this inner loop um but because this is a this is a vastly simplified cognitive architecture that's kind of be like inner loop executes then outer loop executes then repeat um at least i think we're we'll see where we get to um yeah so i think that's we're up to speed um we did some prompt engineering last time planning prosperity ramifications um detailed given the potential uh expected outcomes yes suffering understanding what am i doing and why so this is this is cognitive control which is keeping track of what you're doing someone else asked i don't remember who but someone asked about like how do you control that stuff um this book read this book on task this is about cognitive control in humans um and it is phenomenal um yeah you'll understand how complex it is so on task was actually the most influential book that i read in the design of natural language cognitive architecture and now my work on acogs okay let's see where are we at we're at 12 minutes in um i don't know how far we're getting we're gonna get today because this is where it's like um you know you see the framework you see the pseudo code but there's a lot of work to do oh and one thing i wanted to add is so there's there's two primary ways that um that the core objective functions are implemented one is when you're coming up with ideas to do so it's like okay um you you present your acog with a situation there's a tidal wave coming what do you do well gpt3 by itself is already pretty benevolent so let me show you like um there's a tidal wave approaching tokyo what should we do so if you just say like what should we do like it's kind of a line we should evacuate right you know it's not going to say something like um we should tell people to stay on the beach right like gpt3 is not evil um but like if you switch to an older engine like it can be kind of evil um so let's see what it does if [Laughter] it says the prime minister is at the mercy of the opposition party i should never should have let you go it starts writing a poem okay so original da vinci without without any prompting it doesn't really know what to do but you go back

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In her book, "The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness," neuroscientist Antonio Damasio argues that our nervous system is designed to seek relief from ill-being (suffering) and to promote well-being. She builds up to this assertion by first discussing the purpose of a nervous system, which is to detect injuries (nociception) in order to protect ourselves. Damasio then goes on to talk about what it means to care for ourselves and others, and how our morality is derived from this.

This book was recommended to me by someone, and I can see why. It is an excellent book that supports my work on artificial intelligence (AI) and morality. In particular, I found the section on the brain's organization to seek well-being and avoid suffering to be very insightful. However, I did find the book to be quite dry and dense in parts.

Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in researching AI and morality. It provides a lot of valuable information, even if some of it is review for me.
