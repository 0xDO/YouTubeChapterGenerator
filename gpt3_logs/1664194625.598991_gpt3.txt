on what can be grown in vertical Gardens and hydroponic Farms now that's cool one day a young woman named Sue Min is on her way to work as a chef at a famous restaurant in Seoul so this is 23rd Century Seoul um she's from a small town and is not used to the hustle and bustle of the city she's waiting for her train she notices a handsome man also waiting on the train they make eye contact and there's an instant spark of Attraction all right there's the steamy bit um at the restaurant suman's boss assigns her to task of preparing a special disc for a very important customer the customer is a religious leader from another country interesting who is visiting Korea on a diplomatic Mission so you see how all these different appeal factors get woven in so it's a cooking story that takes place in Korea in the 23rd century and there's a religious uh character so there's a you know the antagonist that seems like there might be some religious tension it's intensifying and stylistically complex and then the steamy bit gotta gotta get that in there um let's see to complicate matters further she is also told that she must use only ingredients that are available in the country which means that she will have to get creative interesting so one thing that I'm noticing is that um when I came to this um some I probably ought to maintain the descriptions for these because I I what I did was I oversimplified it so you know like um scary is obvious sardonic is you know some of some of these are kind of obvious but they're not always obvious so like character if a character is Sassy um you know these books feature characters that are usually women with outsized personality and bottomless well of one-liners and comebacks you know so there is um but particularly the writing style and tone right so if it's incisive like these keenly Discerning books cut right to the heart of the matter right just by adding a little bit more that will cue that'll tell gpt3 what to do and I think that that'll definitely help with writing style character and tone so what I might do is I might go back and add some of this information back in but here let me do a quick time check yeah we're only five minutes I'll pause it and add those back in and we'll see if it helps okay so I went and updated um all the appeal terms well not all of them but some of them so on the characters same number but I just added a little bit better description so it'll prime the pump a little bit more so to speak genres that's the same I de-duplicated it um so it's 192. originally it was over 300 um and then so for the pace got fast paced intensifying leisurely paced settings and of course there's so many more settings I could put in lists of cities towns actually that's not a bad idea um small town rural somewhere uh big city life um then story lines action-packed character driven so on and so forth with um with a little bit more description so again giving it just a little bit more verbiage to chew on um so that gpt3 knows what to do with it um

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Hey everybody, David Shapiro here. I was really excited to work on this earlier. I was working on my novel writer, and I had from a previous experiment, I had 200 different premises. And I was like, "Okay, that's good, but we can do better."

So I was talking to my fiance, who is a librarian by training and an avid reader. And so she sent me this document, which has a list of all kinds of appeal terms. And then what I did was I went to Wikipedia and then I also went to TV tropes and I got lists upon lists of genres.

So I took all that together and I made a bunch of files. We've got character types, we've got genres, we've got 192 genres, three different paces, I did 31 settings, I did 11 storyline types, 24 styles, 39 time periods, 53 tones. And so you multiply all that together, and we have 292 billion different combinations for stories.

I wanted to make sure I got every possible type of story. Now this excludes video games and a few other things, but yeah, so this is a lot. So we can get most story lines in here. And then I stuffed it all into a prompt so brainstorm an extremely long, complete, detailed synopsis for a story with the following appeal terms: genre, setting, time period, story type, pace, character, tone, style.

So this should cover all of literary literature and film and TV, but extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning, middle, and end.

Okay, so I got that. And then I generated, I've generated more than this, but these are the the current ones that are that are pretty good. And so what I did was I stuff it all, so you get all the appeal terms right at the top. And then here's the story.

Appeal term: swashbuckler in Australia in the 21st century, believable, intensifying, conversational, Moody, and plot driven.

So in the year 2020, swashbuckler adventurers still exist and Australia is their playground. 21 year old Lara Croft, despite all of my effort gbt3 still spits out existing character names anyways we'll fine-tune this eventually one day, is the daughter of one such adventure and has always dreamed of following in her Father's footsteps.

Her father is killed on an expedition in the outback, despairing she travels to Australia to bury her father and sell off all his things. In the small town of Millbrook she meets an old man, etc etc.

Okay, so let's just give you an example. No, come here, generate synopsis. So cooking stories in Korea in the 23rd Century, open-ended, intensifying, religiously diverse, steamy, and stylistically complex.

Um, so let's see, yeah, this is like a 1 in 292 billion possibility. Um, it's taking a minute to generate, so I'm wondering how long it's going to be. Okay, so it is the 23rd Century in the world is a very different place. And Korea, a smaller and more densely populated country than it is today, the main form of transportation is by maglev. The cooking style of country has also changed, relying heavily on what can be grown in vertical Gardens and hydroponic Farms.

Now, that's cool. One day a young woman named Sue Min is on her way to work as a chef at a famous restaurant in Seoul. She's from a small town and is not used to the hustle and bustle of the city. She's waiting for her train when she notices a handsome man also waiting on the train. They make eye contact and there's an instant spark of attraction.

At the restaurant, Suman's boss assigns her to task of preparing a special dish for a very important customer. The customer is a religious leader from another country who is visiting Korea on a diplomatic mission. To complicate matters further, she is also told that she must use only ingredients that are available in the country, which means that she will have to get creative.

So one thing that I'm noticing is that when I came to this, some I probably ought to maintain the descriptions for these because I I what I did was I oversimplified it. So you know, like, scary is obvious, sardonic is you know, some of some of these are kind of obvious, but they're not always obvious. So like character, if a character is sassy, you know, these books feature characters that are usually women with outsized personality and bottomless well of one-liners and comebacks.

You know, so there is, but particularly the writing style and tone, right? So if it's incisive, like, these keenly Discerning books cut right to the heart of the matter, right? Just by adding a little bit more that will cue that'll tell gpt3 what to do. And I think that that'll definitely help with writing style, character, and tone. So what I might do is I might go back and add some of this information back in, but here let me do a quick time check. Yeah, we're only five minutes. I'll pause it and add those back in and we'll see if it helps.

Okay, so I went and updated all the appeal terms. Well, not all of them, but some of them. So on the characters, same number, but I just added a little bit better description. So it'll prime the pump a little bit more, so to speak. Genres, that's the same. I de-duplicated it, so it's 192. originally it was over 300. And then for the pace, got fast paced, intensifying, leisurely paced. Settings, and of course there's so many more settings I could put in, lists of cities, towns, actually, that's not a bad idea. Small town, rural, somewhere, big city life. Then story lines, action-packed, character driven, so on and so forth with with a little bit more description. So again, giving it just a little bit more verbiage to chew on, so that gpt3 knows what to do with it.
