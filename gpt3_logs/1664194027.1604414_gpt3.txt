The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: it right so you see it's like okay this isn't exactly right we're looking for what has been prescribed we're also going to um do a few other questions so like uh let's see let's bring this back so just just showing you that it depending on how you change the prompt you get different results the following is a patient patient chart sorry struggling drink some water determine whether or not prognosis whether or not a prognosis was given okay um was a prognosis given yes or no yes okay what is the prognosis prognosis prognosis is excellent was that word used her prognosis is indeed excellent word for word okay um so we would probably in an ideal world we'd want to capture this comment um but anyways uh still the fact of the matter is it is directly getting information so by breaking this and by breaking this problem into two tasks we are um we're making it better and so what i'm going to do is i'll show you how to fine-tune this so that that way you can just do it in one go excuse me okay um although i guess there's nothing wrong with just having multiple prompts because like if you just do if you just do this and you do a search on the output yes or no um then you can run it again however you will still get some variants and if you if you fine-tune a model and you you pick and choose the kinds of responses that you want you'll get far better more consistent results so this is where fine tuning really shines because fine-tuned models tend to be less creative and if you're just answering questions you don't want creativity that's the whole point right confabulation or hallucination um so a little bit of neuroscience there are um disorders out there where people will just confabulate everything um there was one story that i read i think it was in um i think it was in phantoms in the brain where um a little girl was like her iq was super low like she was she had severe like mental handicaps but her she was verbally brilliant her brain just understood language and so she would just confabulate entire stories about her life and she would tell these eloquent stories about this wonderful day that she had with her boyfriend and how he proposed on the banks of a river and it's like this is like an eight-year-old girl she has no idea what she's talking about so her brain was just completely confabulating and if you read that passage and phantoms in the brain it almost looks like something that gpt-3 would spit out um so yeah so gpt3 has a neurological disorder where it just confabulates language so we have to train it to have what is called information literacy or theory of mind so i made another video talking about theory of mind where theory of mind is where you're consciously aware of what you what what is in your head so like if you have theory of mind you say oh i'm experiencing this emotion or i have this knowledge or i don't right gpt3 doesn't have that by default it doesn't know what it doesn't know or it doesn't know what it knows um it has no idea it has no mental index like you or i have so what we have to do is we have to fine tune that in so that's what we're going to do next um so we're gonna have a few um we're gonna have a few prompts and so let's start cleaning this up so we're gonna we're gonna call this the context um we'll remove the rest of this actually here let's save that because that'll be a second one um all right so then we'll just remove the rest of this um so we'll do that we'll call this one um prompt boolean and then we'll do medication okay and then we'll say um all right so then we'll do this so assuming that it passes we'll just leave this here um so that way you know the the rest that when we fine tune it it'll say okay i'm supposed to give you a list um and then we'll say prompt list medication okay so basically we're breaking the problem down into a bool boolean which is true or false and then a list problem so this is two separate cognitive tasks but what we're going to do is we're going to fine tune a model to do both of those in one go this is a relatively straightforward thing so i have a very high degree of confidence that it will work but we want to we we don't want to we don't want to fine-tune an entire model just to find medications sure there's value in that but you know the context that i was given for this problem was imagine you've got um an app right on your phone that is meant to be um like to help you coordinate it's like a single source of truth for your home care team and it's also an interface with your professional care team so say for instance you know grandma's sick you've got 20 family members trying to look after her plus 20 doctors and nurses you all need a single source of truth without having to call each other up so the the problem here is like okay you need to just say like what medications is grandma on and it's got to go through like many many records right to figure that out because ideally you want to figure this out automatically as far as i know this is not commercially available yet this is still being like worked on i don't know anyways this is how i would approach it um okay so then what we'll do is we'll just take this base prompt and we'll go back to what i said determine whether or not a prognosis was given and then we will do the same thing here okay was a prognosis given yes or no so we'll do prompt bull prognosis prognosis there we go and then we will do this with that and probably what i'll do is um i'll probably pause the video because some of this data we would benefit from having someone manually look at this but you know what just for the sake of like experimentation no i'm not going to manually clean it up i'm going to test and see if i can do this whole thing automatically so most of the videos that i've done up until this point have been with synthetic data sets so this is the first one that will be with actual real world data so synthetic data sets are one thing but um uh real world data is a whole other animal

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It is important to be able to determine whether or not a prognosis was given in order to properly treat a patient. However, this can be difficult to do if the patient chart is unstructured.

In order to make this determination, I have broken the problem down into two tasks: a boolean (true or false) task, and a list task. I have created a prompt for each task, and I will be fine-tuning a model to do both tasks in one go.

The boolean task is to determine whether or not a prognosis was given. The list task is to determine what the prognosis is.

With these two tasks, I should be able to determine whether or not a prognosis was given, and if so, what the prognosis is.
