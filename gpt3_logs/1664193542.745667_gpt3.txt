The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: vows and I understand that this topic might be a little too Arcane we can also talk about consensus because consensus uh is something that folks often don't fully understand um I could here I'll actually do a quick little poll all right uh let's see direction of conversation could you repost a Discord URL please yes I will do that in just a second um actually probably someone else in chat could while I'm working on the poll so uh Jordan or anyone else from Discord if you could share the link I don't know if that'll work though if it doesn't I can share it um direction of conversation for tonight um let's see gal uh distributed AI had option um and then or consensus and then last option uh something else tell me in comments okay there we go okay all right let me get you a link to the Discord so for anyone who's not in Discord join here all right we've got one vote for distributed AI so we can keep talking about that um talk about that until oh no we got something else so need to argument okay looks like distributed AI is taking the lead do he centralized Ai and distributed AI um [Music] sorry I'm just Gathering a little bit of information I didn't just like blip out of existence okay oh cool somewhere says some uh a life AI research lab says they watched all my fine tuning videos today and they liked it and it helped improve their results um okay Jordan says he's driving but wants to know about distributed fine-tuning so petals I believe allows for distributed fine-tuning um and then angel baby wants to know about self-aware um I think they meant AI not aw so doing a mental mental uh spell check okay but distributed AI is Far and Away the most popular idea um Okay so there are there are the primary benefit of distributed AI or decentralized AI is also the primary risk so the benefit is that it is resilient and difficult to shut down that is both a benefit and a risk so it's a double-edged sword because if you can't shut it down like you can't stop the signal man um that could be a problem oh we got a comment who was that where are you oh that was another another platform sorry let me mute that tab mute here we go okay um yes so distributed AI so in principle like I said it you have there's a couple ways you can do it you can have a centralized um thing where you've got like you know a university or a company that's just kind of issuing orders to nodes like a botnet right so you can have the botnet model which is kind of the older fashion seti at home or folding at home model of distributed AI or distributed machine learning nothing wrong with that but you have a central controller that completely dictates everything now fast forward a few years and we've got distributed autonomous organizations which are based on blockchain technology which that blockchain can either can you you've got nodes on chain right on the network um and you can you can execute code in a distributed fashion so now you have the possibility of executing code in a reliable manner across an entire network and that means that if you if you also have a recursive aspect to that where you can execute code based on consensus based on what the network wants you to execute then you have the possibility for any kind of distributed workload including distributed AI so what goes AI there's two primary components that go into AI there's data which is the the information that you're putting in and then there's the model which is you know the the neural network or the support machine or the clustering algorithm but those are the two primary components so you've got data and model so when you have distributed AI you're Distributing both you can be Distributing either or both of those aspects so for instance one thing that you can do is you can have data gathered in a distributed fashion so you have many notes all contributing to data in this like grid fashion so imagine that you have a city that's run by Owl and then you have sensors all over that City like pedestrian sensors sewage sensors trash sensors all kinds of stuff and so then the data is being shared in a public manner or maybe it's a private letter either way public or private letter Ledger the point is is that the data is is all being gathered in a single source of Truth and then you can have models also embedded in that Network that are processing and telling garbage trucks where to go for instance this is a very basic use case but it is a a a feasible first use case because it's also pretty safe um you're not going to worry too much about like accidentally causing nuclear war if you have distributed AI telling dump truck where to go um and you're also not going to worry too much about privacy um because you know a trash sensor like there's plenty of trash bins that have sensors already my cousin worked on like radio trash like dumpster sensors like a decade ago or more that used I think 3G at the time um not even 4G they use 3G radios and so then imagine that you've got you know Edge Computing devices that have a little bit rather than talk let's see isn't this what the 5G network is aimed at yeah partly um partly uh actually 6G is one of the bigger ones so surprisingly enough um VMware was actually a big contributor of the 6G standard um I think they worked on it last year or maybe the year before and I read it because I was like even even VMware was like why are we participating in 6G isn't this um in this radio and what was it uh open network um I'm not remembering like can I don't remember anyways um yeah so this is let's see hence the fuss about Huawei yeah uh well hallway is a whole different story so I'm not going to open that can of worms yet um but yeah so getting back on track um you have Edge devices uh you know distributed networking and so rather than having them controlled by you know one platform or another like you know Google Amazon Microsoft Azure whatever they all participate in in in a dow which is you know for in this case this this hypothetical use

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

There are many benefits to distributed AI, but the primary benefit is also the primary risk: it is resilient and difficult to shut down. If you can't shut it down, it could be a problem.

Distributed AI has two primary components: data and model. Data is the information that you're putting in, and model is the neural network or the support machine. When you have distributed AI, you're distributing both.

For instance, you can have data gathered in a distributed fashion. So you have many notes all contributing to data in this like grid fashion. Imagine that you have a city that's run by Owl, and then you have sensors all over that City like pedestrian sensors, sewage sensors, trash sensors, all kinds of stuff. The data is being shared in a public manner or maybe it's a private ledger, but the point is that the data is all being gathered in a single source of Truth.

Then you can have models also embedded in that network that are processing and telling garbage trucks where to go, for instance. This is a very basic use case, but it is a feasible first use case because it's also pretty safe. You're not going to worry too much about accidentally causing nuclear war if you have distributed AI telling dump trucks where to go.

And you're also not going to worry too much about privacy because you know a trash sensor like there's plenty of trash bins that have sensors already. My cousin worked on like radio trash like dumpster sensors like a decade ago or more that used I think 3G at the time. Not even 4G, they use 3G radios.

So then imagine that you've got you know Edge Computing devices that have a little bit of processing power and they're all connected together. You can have distributed AI that's telling dump trucks where to go.

This is just a very basic use case, but it demonstrates how distributed AI can be used in a safe and practical way.
