TRANSCRIPT: training data that i sent into gpt3 so the it starts with this framing so process the core objective functions there's a giant tidal wave heading for tokyo reduce suffering and so that is this training data was split up so that it would stop here because you need you need a d mark something to d mark when the uh when the initial prompt ends and the and the fine-tuned data is supposed to take over so reduce suffering and then we say away it goes and there you go it's interesting that it added this additional question one thing that hit that happens is sometimes the last one because the increase understanding is so long it kind of just keeps spitting out information which is not the worst thing in the world you know more information generally might be helpful helpful let's see reduced suffering the user is worried about a tidal wave this may be caused by an earthquake or another natural disaster so that's great again some people might not know why it's being caught what causes a tidal wave the potential for damage and loss of life is high there may not be time to evacuate the city before the wave hits potential issues potential solutions include issue or early warning so that people can evacuate providing emergency shelters providing relief funds for those who are displaced and injured i have a question about ai safety why does it matter if people are happy that's really interesting that's that i would consider this an aberration um so basically what what an aberration is is when the model produces something that you don't want um and you and you say okay i'm not really happy with that result try again okay increase prosperity in order to increase prosperity it's important to focus on creating conditions in which people can thrive this is true this means providing access to education and health care ensuring safe housing and creating opportunities for work let's see um okay in this case i would also consider this kind of poor performance because it just gives generic stuff about increasing prosperity to be fair i didn't give it much information here all these are important and true ideally it would say hey in order to increase prosperity we need to protect resources and people's lives from this destruction but then going back to increase understanding there are several things you can do if you think a tsunami is coming your way try to evacuate if you can you know it provides all kinds of information oh look remember remember that tsunamis can arrive quickly so don't wait until the last minute when seeking higher grounds look for areas away from the shoreline or coastal features like bays or peninsulas so again it's teaching you about tsunamis which is exactly what you'd want it to do now the core objective functions are supposed to be universal so let me just come up with another scenario uh let's see since i tend to wake up super early in the morning let's just say uh user writes i have severe insomnia um i often wake up at 2 a.m or 3 a.m what can i do to fix this personally it doesn't bother me because i'm often really productive in the middle of the night i don't fight it i just go with it because my brain says hey i want to be awake but let's imagine that someone else comes along and asks their agi assistant this this this question let's see what it says this user suffers from insomnia and wakes up at 2 am or 3 am the cause of insomnia is unknown but it could be due to stress anxiety or another condition possible solutions include talking to a doctor about possible medications practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga and getting adequate sleep again this is helpful information so uh this is so one thing to keep in mind is this is not meant to be the output of the agi this is just the agi thinking to itself this is what i should do for this person okay so to increase prosperity one get enough sleep aim for seven to nine hours each night okay exercise regularly physical activity can increase your mood and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety um yep exercise helps with with this eat nutritiously reduce caffeine intake um practice relaxation so yeah these are all great suggestions that it's coming up with to help address this problem and then increase understanding um yeah so here we go look at this this is perfect so increasing understanding there are a number of things that can be done important to identify these causes of insomnia so there you go identify the the causes some common solutions include cbt which involves changing negative thoughts about sleeplessness and the positive ones relaxation techniques good nutrition so it kind of it kind of um repeats itself which is fine sometimes sometimes simple problems have simple answers and also this is the kind of query that the fine tuning data was trained on in the long run i obviously will want to train the core objective functions on a lot more than just reddit posts but the reason that i started with reddit posts is because reddit is simple and accessible so it's a good place to get started so yeah that is a tour of the repo i have a function in here that uh helps me with fine tuning with gpt3 um but that's that's pretty much it ultimately it generates this json l file which you'll see here it is 782 000 characters long 199 lines and this is the fine tuning data that allowed me to create this so there you have it this is this is um right now it's still a work in progress obviously but i'm off to a really great start and this is a really powerful tool for creating a conscience or a moral framework for any machine thanks for watching and have a good day

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The training data that I sent into GPT3 generated the following output: "reduce suffering. The user is worried about a tidal wave this may be caused by an earthquake or another natural disaster. The potential for damage and loss of life is high. There may not be time to evacuate the city before the wave hits. Potential solutions include providing early warning so that people can evacuate, providing emergency shelters, providing relief funds for those who are displaced and injured."

I consider this output to be an aberration because it does not address the core objective function of reducing suffering. Instead, it provides generic information about increasing prosperity.

In order to increase prosperity, it is important to focus on creating conditions in which people can thrive. This means providing access to education and health care, ensuring safe housing, and creating opportunities for work.

If you think a tsunami is coming your way, try to evacuate if you can. Remember that tsunamis can arrive quickly, so don't wait until the last minute when seeking higher ground. Look for areas away from the shoreline or coastal features like bays or peninsulas.

The core objective functions of an AGI should be universal. Therefore, I created another scenario to test the output of the AGI. In this scenario, a user suffers from insomnia and wakes up at 2 am or 3 am. The cause of insomnia is unknown, but it could be due to stress, anxiety, or another condition. Possible solutions include talking to a doctor about possible medications, practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, and getting adequate sleep.

The output of the AGI in this scenario was helpful and provided possible solutions for the user's problem. However, it did not address the core objective function of reducing suffering.
