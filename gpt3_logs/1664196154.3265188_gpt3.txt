The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you're trying to do something more complicated such as um uh curate a fine-tuned data set so that you can improve your models automatically that's one thing that i'm testing and experimenting with and writing about you might need a thousand results you might need 10 000 results so there's search and then there's bound which is give me everything between time stamp a and timestamp b and so this is how you can say like okay i found a memory that i want to explore it happened at you know time index 123.456. give me everything from time index 120 to 130 right and so then you can reconstruct an entire memory based on what was happening at that time what was coincidental um so those and oh and then there's a save function because i realized that um saving the data after every instance was getting slower and slower so you only call the save periodically and solar is the same way like solar you send it everything and then you tell it to save once you're done and i think you can configure it to save automatically periodically or after a certain number of um of uh indexes so anyways this is this is the microservice and then there's a test.pi which is just it does a quick you know it sends it a bunch of vectors and then it performs a search and it and it shows you timestamps um it's pretty fast it certainly could be faster uh ultimately i'm going to use probably something like feis f-i-f-a-i-s-s this thing as as part of the back end so it'll be even faster um yeah that's the primary thing there's a lot of a lot to experiment with but that's pretty much it i guess i can talk about these other microservices so here you see i've got six micro services one is the nexus which i just showed you that's the first and also kind of the easiest one and i've got the core objective functions or what i call the heuristic imperatives now um so this is a microservice that i've actually worked on core objective functions um i've got all the all the experiments leading up to it here um which i've got four different experiments plus a few others that i've started oh wow 11 stars some people are are liking this so that's good um so basically what the core objective functions do is it is always commenting on three primary principles which is reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding so what this microservice is doing is it's always injecting it's well first it's reading the nexus it says what's going on and then it's always offering thoughts about here's how we can reduce suffering here's how we can increase prosperity here's how we can increase understanding and so then what it does is it does a few things one it reacts to the current moment it says this is what's going on this is these are some ideas about how we can do this then if you have another service that says like an action planning service that says what if we do x y and z the core objective functions will also read that and say hey that sound that sounds like a good idea that will reduce suffering or maybe that's not the best idea try something else and so this is like the conscience or the conscientiousness of the artificial cognition constantly saying do this don't do this you know this is this is in alignment with what we want to do yes or no and this is how your brain works right you have parts of your prefrontal cortex that are constantly evaluating your behavior and decisions to make sure that it is socially acceptable that it is legal that it's not going to hurt yourself and so the core objective functions basically form the highest order of this is what we should do so the core objective functions can also do a few other things they can brainstorm right it says okay given the situation here's you know 10 ideas of things to do um and so it's always just kind of barfing that information into the nexus which is then can be read by every other service you can have input services such as things that handle vision and audio and they all dump their information into the nexus and oh and this is all in natural language by the way so all thought happens in natural language you're not going to be dumping in images or raw audio that's what the microservices are for to handle those peripherals so this is this is pure thought this is not going to be in anything other than human readable natural language which is also important for for interpretability and transparency because we want to be able to see what our artificial cognition is thinking i call them aces artificial cognitive entity and so then you'll have output microservices so these are microservices that'll be reading the nexus and as you have action planning and forecasting things that say okay we should do this yes and so you know how like in your head you make a decision i'm gonna do this and then what another part of your brain another micro service effectively in your brain takes that decision and then acts on it in the outside world and there's there's a stack of things that happen in your brain before you you plan something so you get ideas you plan something and then once you've got the plan then once it's time to actually execute that's what the output microservices are going to do another service that you see listed here is the agent service or the um what i'll call the agent model service so this is the the purpose of this microservice is to keep track of who am i what am i what can i do because one thing that's critical is the and this is implicit right you as a human being you know that you have two hands you have feet you can speak you can you you know what you are you know what you're capable of so the agent model service is responsible for telling the nexus okay this is what i am this is what i'm capable of because in order to act you need to have some sense of self and so one thing that most of these services do some of these are more static like the vision service that's just you know it's it's gonna have you know access to cameras and it'll have um you know like

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The microservice known as the nexus is responsible for constantly injecting thoughts about how to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. This microservice is always reading the nexus and offering thoughts and suggestions about what the artificial cognition should do in order to meet these objectives. If another microservice, such as the action planning service, has an idea about how to improve the current situation, the core objective functions will read that and decide whether or not it is a good idea. This microservice is responsible for constantly evaluating the artificial cognition's behavior and decision making in order to ensure that it is meeting the highest objectives.

The output microservices are responsible for taking the decisions made by the artificial cognition and executing them in the outside world. This microservice is responsible for keeping track of what the artificial cognition is capable of and updating the nexus accordingly. This microservice is also responsible for brainstorming ideas and barfing them into the nexus.

The agent service is responsible for keeping track of who the artificial cognition is and what it is capable of. This microservice is responsible for telling the nexus what the artificial cognition is and what it is capable of so that it can act accordingly.
