TRANSCRIPT: in the history of novels and literature people thought when novels when the penny dreadful came out when when people started reading for pleasure um back in like victorian england people thought that that was going to corrupt society because it was so grotesque and pornographic and stuff and they thought that novels were going to destroy society and destroy art and now of course novel writing has been refined into its own art form um the same was said of cinema that cinema was going to destroy the art form of of um of of theater right that it was you know oh well instead of having stage actors now you have screen actors um same thing ditto for radio so every time we have a new medium come out there's always really really big pushback um from the status quo but also what happens is inevitably um when you have uh a new art a new medium come out um it just expands art so basically what i think that we're seeing is the the in the invention of a new domain of art i see this as no different from the uh creation of um of cinema radio uh video games right you know video games are a some of them are grotesque whatever but video games are a high art form because there's music there's characters there's story depending on the video games that you play the video games that i play um so anyways i'm not too worried about it from an ethics and safety perspective because like you know um there there have been books that have been banned because they were considered to you know pornographic or grotesque or corrupting or whatever but now we don't do that either right it's like okay you know 0.2 on the page where the words hurt you um you know people have a choice as to whether or not they read a book um so i am not worried about ai art nor am i even worried about it displacing um human generated art so like yeah like you might be able to have um you know you see you see the quality of these animations and there's plenty more um there's plenty more i think i had one tagged um so there's this one which is animated with sound it's super creepy i'm not going to play it um but basically what we're going to end up with very soon is animated scenes and then that's going to get strung together to make animated movies and then you know as as large language models advance which you know if gpt4 is coming out or other things um we're gonna see like basically on-demand art uh whether it's still images videos novels whatever actually i was having a conversation with someone where um they they looked at my novel generating um repo and they're like yeah it gets stuck in in repetition they're like well what about what about short stories like couldn't you start there and i was like yeah that's actually probably a better place to start so i might revisit that and just make a short story generator um that's actually not a bad idea um so you know if you have on-demand art uh like how's that gonna change society is that going to take away uh from people but here's the thing is you have people that will consume so much art all day every day so like with the rise of you know i'm old enough i remember napster there was so much hunger to have more music that people would break the law to download music i don't do that anymore because i don't need to because the market responded and gave me spotify right so what if there's going to be like a spotify for ai art and ai music and ai ai literature right like there is so much opportunity here for new businesses and here's the thing is like most movies today are generated largely by machines anyways yes there's a human behind the machine telling it what to do but there's that's no different from the human operating these new tools right so i see ai art as more like a new set of tools for the creative process um yeah that i mean that's that's the primary thing that i wanted to say um on the topic of agi so this is kind of what i'm bouncing back and forth between today on the topic of agi i actually stumbled across this guy um who uh his youtube channel and and uh twitter handle are sentientism um he has done some really great interviews uh and basically his his primary thing is that uh morality and ethics should be centered around all sentient life forms um rather than human and so that is something that he and i agree on we've had some twitter conversations about like hey when when we invent agi it needs to think about all sentient life not just humans i think it should go further i think that agi should should um think about all life forms not just whether or not it's sentient but uh it's you know we don't have to agree on everything um let's see so oh and then i wanted to um talk about ai alignment on linkedin because it's not just on twitter right if you see something on twitter that's one thing but it's also on linkedin and it's also on youtube um so like people are talking about agi like you know here's you just search for ai alignment kyle o'brien applied scientist at microsoft so here is someone who's like legit right and we're like we're having sober conversations about agi and and people aren't talking about it like because up until this year people would talk about agi like it was some distant possibility maybe several decades away um and and they would talk about it like it would like like if you talked about agi people would look at you like you're a ufo enthusiast right like oh you know grab the tinfoil hat but now like people in the industry are taking it seriously so yeah so this is this is my first go at a kind of a state of the art um episode um let me know well i turned off comments because so let me know what you think on on twitter or in the um in the discord and we'll go from there but yeah thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the history of novels and literature, people used to think that novels would corrupt society. They thought that the penny dreadfuls of Victorian England were so grotesque and pornographic that they would destroy society and art. However, novels have now been refined into their own art form.

The same was said of cinema when it first came out. People thought that it would destroy the art of theater. However, cinema has now been refined into its own art form. Radio was also thought to be destructive when it first came out, but it too has been refined into its own art form.

Every time a new medium comes out, there is always a lot of pushback from the status quo. However, what happens is that the new medium invariably expands art. So, what we are seeing with the invention of AI art is the expansion of the art form, not its destruction.

AI art is no different from any other new medium. There will always be people who are opposed to it, but it will ultimately expand the possibilities of art. There is so much potential for new businesses with on-demand AI art. Most movies today are already generated largely by machines. So, the addition of AI art is simply a new set of tools for the creative process.

Morality and ethics should be centered around all sentient life forms, not just humans. This is something that we need to keep in mind as we develop artificial intelligence. AI should be designed to think about all life forms, not just those that are sentient. This will help to ensure that AI is aligned with our values.
