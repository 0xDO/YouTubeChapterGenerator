The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: spotify how do we integrate past conversations into this um so let's just copy paste the thing that was already started and i'll say um was that east or west rome and then we'll say what we'll see what tim says tim is short-circuiting um oh that was east rome west rome fell in 479 haiti i think tim's wrong anyways i realized that i also need to get out of the fine-tuned model okay so let's go back to just plain vanilla that was the western roman empire west yes okay so clearly the fine-tuned model is not perfect but we also see that it uh it it spit out the answer and it didn't so this was one advantage of fine tuning is that you get the format that you want um the instruct series tends to do the double new line after an answer which i find kind of irritating but whatever we can there's ways to compensate for that okay so um what we want to do is figure out a way to incorporate this kind of information into this so like how do we do that um let's see there are hints added into the chat logs that tim can use to give correct answers tim should use um oh hang on my dog's barking gotta let him in morning ritual okay i'm back sorry about that um okay so tim should use the hints which are not seen by the user to give accurate answers okay so let's see if this works um because if this does work then we can integrate like all kinds of stuff from from the outside world you know obviously right now i'm just searching wikipedia but there's no reason that you couldn't search google or actually integrate other apis so i set up my discord server by the way you should join if if you'd like there's going to be a link in the description and one of the guys in my discord server is working on doing language to api calls which means it if you can if you can integrate if you can seamlessly integrate any api call into any prompt then like the sky's the limit right you can control robots you can control computer games you can search any information you need once you get api calls working so his work is very impressive yeah very smart people in in the discord so but for now i'm just doing it manually by calling wikipedia in the back end um okay so let's change topics a little bit um who is the last emperor let's actually just see what it says here romulus augustus who was over thrown in 476 80. okay so he got that right but i wonder what happens if we because this is this is going to be a mess legitimacy yeah inclusion criteria [Music] okay so it's all here eastern emperor zeno ended yeah all right so let's let's copy this because this actually just has the answer in it so then we'll duplicate that and we'll say okay so this is um and if this was our question whoops that's not what i meant to do there we go so our question and then i think i said passage um for this so tutor chat bot stop opening for the tutor chatbot we need our long term um merge oh that's merging that's not what i needed i needed answer yeah okay so use the following passage to answer to provide a detailed answer to the question so then we'll just say we'll copy and paste this up here [Music] and this is the prompt that i'm going to use in this in this particular cognitive architecture okay so in this case um i this is not a detailed answer um i don't like it i mean it does answer the question but it doesn't provide any context um but let's heck with it let's just integrate it right now because um doing just prompt engineering is going to be like good enough okay so hint and then let's see if that modifies what tim says okay and just spit it out um user okay weird i thought it was someone else tim why do you think that you tell me who was constantine oh okay user what about the western empire gotcha okay so that's not so bad um so what we can do is um by pulling this by by by having this hint integrated um every now and then i think we can get a little bit more interesting results um okay so that works let me let me just copy this and this will be our new chat prompt so we'll start here so double new line prompt chat we'll see if this works okay so now we gotta we we've got we've got our wiki we've got our answer um so that we we generate we generate a question right um generate a specific question um and then we get the answer so answer question which does the same thing and this is actually several steps because we're assuming that we're going to have a really long answer or several answers right because if you look at how long this is this might take several prompts to get to get an accurate answer and so then we'll put the hint in and see if tim can integrate that and this is all just prompt engineering this isn't even fine tuning once i get some more chat data um this could probably be fine-tuned and that actually makes me think i wonder if i should if i should um save it all separately uh well no because i save it all out to a uh to a log file long-term chat so we'll say gpt-3 logs and then yeah that'll be fine because two of these functions see we write it out to gpt3 logs for the completion um so for the chat completion and actually i will probably just get rid of that because we're not even going to use it i don't think yeah all right gpt 3 logs make sure that's the only two places we use it yeah all right so we're not using the um we're not using the fine-tuned model so we can just delete that function that's fine okay uh tokens200 we'll increase this token just in case he gives a little bit longer of a response oh let's do 400 that's fine okay so completion create engine engine i think they're changing this to model actually so that'll be deprecated before too long uh okay so now we've got to integrate all this together so we've got um populate chat prompt so prompt equals all right um convo and then we will also need the hint hint and then it'll end with tim okay uh where did i go here it is all right so prompt chat replace oh we'll do we'll use the same nomenclature block all right so block with convo block there it is and then

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to integrate past conversations into the Spotify chatbot, we need to first copy and paste the existing conversation into the chatbot. Then, we need to figure out a way to incorporate the new information into the conversation. One way to do this is to use hints that are added into the chat logs. These hints can be used to give the chatbot accurate answers. Additionally, we can use the information in the chat logs to generate new questions. By doing this, we can provide a more detailed answer to the question.
