TRANSCRIPT: unobserved ufos the closest galactic civilization that makes flying aircraft is obviously us most obviously not guaranteed so i'll say like likely us but there could be others on the other hand probabilistically there could be others right um let's see rory o'connor i'm really interested in translating ai art and video into something that supports more narrative structure what kind of hurdles do we have to overcome before 13 year olds win oscars with laptops that's a great question so as an author actually my first novel is with a professional editor right now i've got about two weeks before i get it and get it back so excited um so the longer a story you create the more cycles it takes to write it so you know a good writer could sit down and hammer out a thousand word or a five hundred to a thousand word flash fiction in an afternoon my novel is ninety four thousand words and i've been working on it for three and a half years the reason that stories take so long to make and take so many cycles and revisions is because you're inventing a whole world and you're also simulating you know i have six povs and then dozens more characters so you have to go through and simulate a whole bunch of other human minds you have to simulate a whole other world you have to do you have to run so many calculations in your head it takes a long time to make sure you do that right but if a computer can run a simulation right we have unreal engine we have um uh blender we have all kinds of other simulation engines that can keep track of all that and if for instance my cognitive architecture work um you know natural language cognitive architecture and maragi come out we can have artificial characters that are fully realized with personalities and belief structures and everything so so step one is you know integrate simulation um not just of worlds but of people right because getting good compelling characters is one of the absolute hardest parts of writing compelling stories if you really love a story so one of my favorite games of all time is uh mass effect and bioware bioware is the company sorry mass effect and dragon age they're both made by bioware and i got my fiance into it um she got she's into dragon age she's reading the books playing all the games it's great um a lot of people love dragon age and or mass effect and it's because of the great characters they're very character-centric stories now there's the great there's the grand epic you know framing you know it's very um like tolkienian um is what's going on in the background but what makes those game what makes people fall in love with those games are the characters um you have these really compelling characters and they clash with each other and they have their own their own um emotions and desires and visions and everything and so getting the ability to simulate hyper-realistic or actually not even hyper-realistic but like um uh dramatic characters that is going to be one of the hardest things to do because you put characters in a simulated world and the story will tell itself right but as as an author as someone creating a story you know you look at um at the biggest movies of of the year right the ones that sell a billion dollars worth of tickets which is usually mcu um well pretty much anything by disney lately because they have learned to churn out billion dollar movies but then you then other things like dune right and so there's a lot of of of philosophy and mythology that goes into good characters and now we can put psychology to it as well um and so but getting those good characters and putting them like you can you can have relatively um trope-ish settings right because like dragon age it's like okay there's a basically a zombie horde um or dragons or demons attacking and it's like okay sure whatever right you know the big bad is a demon nothing particularly compelling about that but the part that's compelling about that story is the characters so simulating really compelling characters is going to be the key thing to first making um ai generated novels and then as soon as we can do that it's going to be a very small step between um you know taking that and then generating images and scenes and dialogue and music but getting the story because again you know 94 000 word novel takes three and a half years there are authors that put 10 years in every novel that they they write and it's because of how much cognitive labor it takes to run that simulation and also there's this thing you have to do where you have to kind of compress a story right because what what happens is as you're drafting a story you end up with scenes and characters that are kind of all over the place and then you have to you have to tighten it up because it then it has to you have to follow like mythic stereotypes um in order to make the story because real life is messy right real life is not linear real life is not neatly wrapped up um but a good story is not realistic like that so that's that's my answer to your question about what what it's going to take for 13 year olds to do these things um okay to do um let's see went from artificial gods to bees i love the evolution yes um who knows maybe maybe hive minds of bees are actually smarter than us there's more bees than humans on the planet um let's see some rando on long-term interstellar missions other stars approach our solar system uh to around 0.5 light years every few hundred thousand to million years um i guess you mean probably in the course of like just drifting around as we orbit um so like i guess what you're saying is like you just chill in one solar system and you wait for another um system to drift nearby and then you kind of hop over so that could be that could be cool um it's almost like life isn't designed for organic creatures or any type of life form to exist for eternity it's like a subtle story that appears and fades away nothing more um yeah what you just said is surprisingly mythic so let me read

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It is possible that the closest galactic civilization to us is one that employs flying aircraft. However, this is by no means guaranteed. There is a probability that there could be others.

Rory O'Connor is interested in translating AI art and video into something that supports more narrative structure. He asks what kind of hurdles we have to overcome before 13 year olds win Oscars with laptops.

O'Connor says that one of the hardest parts of writing compelling stories is creating fully realized characters with their own personalities, belief structures, and emotions. He believes that getting the ability to simulate hyper-realistic characters will be the key to making AI-generated novels.

Once we can do that, it will be a small step to generating images, dialogue, and music. However, the story is the most important part. A 94,000 word novel takes three and a half years to write because of the cognitive labor required to run the simulation.
