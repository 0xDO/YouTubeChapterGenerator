TRANSCRIPT: paperback copies are mostly for me um so the latest book is symphony of thought i'll actually go ahead and just drop a link to it in the chat so you can download it for free pdf epub docx um let's see did you write anything on the possibility that agi has already been created in another sector of our galaxy um that is a great thought experiment we'll get into that so in the in the comments i don't know if if you can see it whoever's watching whenever um anyways old zany asks um did you write anything on the possibility that agi has already been created in another sector of the galaxy i'll answer that in just a second but first let me finish introducing um symphony of thought so symphony of thought is my third book which is about the principles of artificial cognition and let's see i have another message make sure that folks can get in one second doing a live stream okay that's fine um yes so symphony of thought symphony of thought is about how okay all these different abilities that are outlined in these first two books right they're they're all outlined i've built several prototypes but the thing is when you have a whole bunch of different language models interacting with memory systems and all this stuff it gets real complex real fast um and so but then there's also the how do you approximate human cognition to these machine components because you know we have large language models which is like okay that can generate language great it's an auto complete engine how do you get from an auto complete engine to artificial cognition and that is the point of symphony of thought which is like okay let's decompose all the different aspects of human cognition such as planning brainstorming self-correction error detection agent model i know what i am and i know what i'm capable of i know what my limitations are i know what i know and i know and by extension i know what i don't know um like if you i know a little bit about quantum physics because i've read a few books about it but if you like start throwing theories at me in the math i'll be like i don't know i know that i don't know that um so how do you handle those things that is the purpose of symphony of thought now my background work is what i'm working up to is a fully realized artificial cognitive entity and the the architecture is what i call maragi which is an acronym that means microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence so that's going to be my next project when i get around to it um okay so the question um let's see oh adrian says hello hello we'll listen while working on my dolly composition um so yes um we're doing ai here all day every day um i'll put in i'll put in chat that acronym that i just said maragi equals micro services architecture for robotics and artificial or i know how to spell like problems artificial general intelligence okay so that's that's the ultimate goal is to create a cognitive architecture and here's the underlying philosophy behind how it's going to be stable um so on and so forth okay okay cool we got some more questions coming in so now get to old zany's question because he or she or they had it first um the possibility that agi has already been created in another sector of our galaxy okay so this is one of my favorite topics are we alone in the universe functionally right now we seem to be alone we have telescopes and radios all over the place and we see and hear nothing now we just figured out how to build radios and telescopes so it's entirely possible that they're just not sophisticated enough to see other civilizations out there so that's one possibility another possibility is that they're hiding from us right if they're millions of years more advanced than us then they can just be stealth or whatever or hide you know they can they can out maneuver us right because the thing is is like with just a little bit more technology you know like if you were to drop a uh you know a 60 year old airplane or a 100 year old airplane into a battlefield today it would not have a snowball's chance in hell against a modern jet fighter that's only one century of time difference in technology now imagine you extend that out to you know by several orders of magnitude um you know a million years if if if there is an alien race out there somewhere that has invented agi or anything before us if it's anything more than a hundred years ahead of us we don't have any chance of detecting it or surviving it so the fact that we don't see them means that they could be stealth or avoiding us or they don't exist right those are kind of the two primary possibilities now that being said there also might be physics limitations um so one one thing that a friend of mine many years ago said he's a great scientist um studies cosmology his his profession is material science but he almost got a minor in cosmology anyways one of the things that he pointed out he's like maybe faster than light travel just isn't physically possible and if that's true if it's if if faster than light travel is not possible you know obviously there's stories about ufos that can like teleport or whatever that's possible maybe but maybe it isn't and so if faster than light travel is not possible and we're all limited to say 10 the speed of light that makes the universe really big um and really difficult to get around and so if someone's going to take the time to get somewhere else like to come here from you know even even our stellar neighborhood that's a huge time investment um so if that's the case then we're an island in the middle of nowhere and we might be functionally alone for millions or billions of years so that's that's my take on um on what if agi or something else exists elsewhere now that being said if you wanted to make sure that you're um that your civilization or that your species um or that your biome was going to survive you'd want to put it on a ship that is run by an agi because that agi could outlive your entire

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In his video, David Shapiro discusses the possibility that artificial general intelligence (AGI) may have already been created by another civilization in another part of the galaxy. He starts by explaining his background work on creating a fully realized artificial cognitive entity. He then outlines the two primary possibilities for why we have not seen any evidence of AGI elsewhere in the universe. The first possibility is that other civilizations are simply too far away for us to detect them. The second possibility is that they are hiding from us, either because they are afraid of us or because they are so far ahead of us technologically that we would not be able to survive an encounter with them. He then goes on to discuss the possibility that there may be physics limitations that prevent faster-than-light travel, which would make it very difficult for any civilization to reach us from even our nearest stellar neighbors. In conclusion, Shapiro argues that if we want to ensure the survival of our species, we should put AGI in charge of running our civilization, as they would be able to outlive us and make better decisions than we could.
