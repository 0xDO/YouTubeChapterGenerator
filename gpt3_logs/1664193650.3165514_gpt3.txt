TRANSCRIPT: materialism away from realism and away from local realism and towards um a dualist uh interpretation uh towards uh um a non-local and non-real interpretation of of the universe what does that mean does that mean that like there are gods and spirits i don't know um it's possible uh but but basically so this professor he does a much better job of explaining he comes up short saying like materialism doesn't satisfy everything does that mean that it's divine i don't remember the word that he uses he's like i can't make that claim but all i can say is that materialism doesn't satisfy so if materialism does not satisfy our the an explanation for our consciousness what does that mean about machine intelligence and machine consciousness um i don't know but what it what what my current interpretation that's not the one that i wanted to show my current interpretation is that phenomenal consciousness which is that subjective experience of us being it is it is like something to be us we have a subjective experience that is almost impossible to articulate but the obviousness of it is that we have this conscious experience i am starting to believe that maybe this is a characteristic that is unique to living things um i'm not gonna you know say like only humans have souls um i can't make that claim um but uh it it seems like there is something special about about being us um yeah so genius myth i talked about how eugene rose was very depressed because he had moved away from from god and and he needed to go back because he needed to have a purpose genius myth talks about finding a purpose with or without religion um remarkable book um and and well my brain is drawing a blank as to why i feel the need to talk about it so i'll just set this down for right now um okay so going back to materialism this book brain trust which looks at morality and ethics from a neuroscience perspective and an evolutionary perspective this book comports very well with my book benevolent by design so one of the things that patricia churchlin says in this book is that the entire purpose of a nervous system you central nervous system which is your brain and your peripheral nervous system which is um uh your the your sensation and your motor control and and even your um enteric nervous system which is your your guts your innards the purpose of these is strictly to help you survive and you know so that's at the first principle is the purpose of the nervous system is to help you survive a higher order purpose is to move away from harm or damage or another word for that is suffering so subjectively we suffer um when we are up when we're when we're approaching death right pain hurts because it represents damage to your body which represents a risk of death and we and it also is to move us towards a state of thriving or a state of of well-being those are the two fundamental purposes of of the central nervous system of our nervous system as a whole and those are directly mirrored by my first two core objective functions which is to one reduce suffering and to increase prosperity so again i always say like i don't i haven't invented anything i'm just building off of what other people have discovered um so if we have that as the first two principles of the the primary purposes of our nervous system well then what the heck is the purpose of our if if we have a soul if we have phenomenal consciousness why like the universe is way more complex if we're not just biological entities that are you know where you and i are a little better than ants right um in terms of our function we you know we eat we reproduce we eventually die um so what's the difference and so uh michael mead in the genius myth talks about finding a more transcendent purpose um your higher purpose your soul's purpose your divine purpose right because if we have an immaterial uh or a non-real or a non-materialistic um view of our consciousness then you know we there the possibilities are endless right the skies are the limit there's two there's too many possibilities to calculate which is why i have the third objective function as increase understanding the quest to understand to learn is to me my highest purpose and that's why i have my youtube channel that's why i'm doing these videos and so the conclusion that i can come to right now is will a machine ever have phenomenal consciousness like us it's hard to say right if if if materialism was true and consciousness was just a matter of performing the correct calculations then i would say yes absolutely machines could have a consciousness equal to or more sophisticated than our own however it seems like there is a non-material component of human of the human experience of our consciousness that cannot be explained by materialism that cannot be explained by matter and energy as we understand it today maybe it's entirely possible that we'll discover you know um magnetic or other energetic fields and patterns of energy around our heads that explain um you know near-death experiences if that's the case if materialism ultimately can't explain everything then yeah the the answer is as obvious if materialism ultimately can explain everything if empiricism ultimately can explain everything then can we say that lambda or a machine like it is is fully sentient is fully conscious like us absolutely but that is the key question is materialism true or false right now it's looking like no materialism does not explain everything and there's this whole other realm of of reality or existence that we can barely even begin to describe and so that's the key question and so whenever i whenever i say like on the forums or whatever when i say like this will be decades or centuries of debate that's what i mean is this the answer to whether or not a machine that can behave like us has an experience like us will take a long time to figure out and it's because of this this debate that's rooted in where we're at today which is nihilism post-modernism

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In recent years, there has been a shift away from materialism and realism, and towards a dualist interpretation of the universe. This means that there is a non-local and non-real aspect to reality that cannot be explained by materialism alone. This has implications for machine intelligence and consciousness. If materialism is not the whole story, then it is possible that machines could have a consciousness equal to or more sophisticated than our own. However, this is a question that will take many years or even centuries to fully answer.
