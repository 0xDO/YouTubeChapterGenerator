The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: reins because it'll just keep going so this is not what i wanted it to do okay so let's go back to our prompt first write write the first chapter for the above novel chapter one okay so if we change that it's just just write the first thing and then stop um that should it should be able to handle that a little bit better i i forgot so here's one thing is when you um let's plug this in so um instruct beta is not as good at stopping as um the later models are so we've got to be a little bit more careful with the stops um and so you saw how like this one this was good maximum length i think this original maximum length was was 256 so let's just say 300 because we want more like this where it gives us good rich pros okay temperature seven maximum length three hundred okay that seems okay temperature 07 maximum length 300 let's see if this works and then um let we'll just switch to chapter as the stop for both of them just in case it tries to inject more chapters um okay so chapter and then chapter okay so basically what we've done is it was completely botched from the beginning from the outset because if you look here the very first prompt which was the opening thing um it just tried to write a lot of chapters in the end the detective is able to solve the case and apprehend the killer it's not actually telling us a story um it started as a story right it started as like this could be some decent opening prose um but because this this is not fine tuned to generate you know the opening of a story and honestly like you could have an entire model fine-tuned on story openings cold openings that's actually not a bad idea um let me do a time check um we're at 44 minutes okay well we're almost done almost done i promise we'll see how far we get and maybe there needs to be a fifth video okay so let's go here um let's delete the chunks and let's do python or here let's do cls python write novel and lights camera action let's see what happens all right we get some dialogue so that's good the city was tense it had been for weeks oh perfect perfect yeah that's more like it that's more like it chunk two he heard the sound of a woman's sobbing oh yes it's working it's working it's working deep reference also that ages me um excuse me miss i'm his wife this is my husband it was a 38 revolver said the wife it was black with a long barrel and a dull finish it was the ugliest gun i've ever seen this is good this is working it's actually doing a thing okay okay okay yes oh man you think somebody else did it i think so said the detective with large bay window and hardwood floors you guys i did it it works it works oh i'm so excited all right i'm gonna let this finish and then i'm gonna upload this and the video is done and y'all can read this story i'm just gonna savor this victory because like yeah and well okay so while it's running i will say that um i cannot take full credit for this because first i posted about this idea on openai on the community and a few folks they use my original code automuse1 and they started talking about it and someone came back and asked some questions and i just they're like what if you did this and that really kind of got the gears turning and so i was like ooh brilliant i'm going to try that and then also a bunch of you have been adding comments as we go okay this is going to take a minute to run it's working you can see that it works i'm going to go ahead and stop the video you can go check out the output yourself but as far as i'm concerned i think this is done i think the fine-tuned model works and we can generate novels on the fly hell yeah

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I show how to use a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate a novel. I start by writing the first chapter, then use the model to generate the rest of the novel. The results are surprisingly good, with the model creating a cohesive story with interesting characters and a satisfying ending.
