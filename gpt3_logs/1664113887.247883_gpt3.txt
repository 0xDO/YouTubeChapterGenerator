0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:07:19.260,0:07:25.980
be think Global um because if you don't gpt3 just
it always defaults to being very american-centric
0:07:25.980,0:07:34.020
for some reason okay there we go sequencing
genome that's not a place gpt3 nice try
0:07:36.600,0:07:37.260
okay
0:07:40.560,0:07:41.820
ah there we go
0:07:44.340,0:07:44.840
um
0:07:49.080,0:07:50.760
I guess uh let's do like
0:07:53.880,0:07:59.520
monuments um and historical
sites let's see what it gives us
0:08:05.280,0:08:06.000
interesting
0:08:09.120,0:08:09.840
oops
0:08:12.300,0:08:16.560
some of these are pretty cool a lot of
them are Rome so very Western Centric
0:08:19.620,0:08:27.480
um I guess I did say historical sites um
that's fine anyways we don't we don't need
0:08:27.480,0:08:35.160
a uh an empirical list all we need is something
to draw from so let's get rid of those lines
0:08:36.780,0:08:40.920
and then those we got famous people
0:08:43.140,0:08:52.020
and this is this is for the easy one anyways um
okay so we will find and replace Dash with nothing
0:08:53.100,0:09:00.660
and then we'll also find and replace space
with nothing there we go okay so now we've
0:09:00.660,0:09:10.080
got a list of common words so then what we'll do
is we will um let's see do we have um run random
0:09:10.680,0:09:17.220
import seed choice all right so what
we're going to do is clear this out
0:09:18.900,0:09:25.920
um to do uh choose difficulty I
might just have it where you just
0:09:26.640,0:09:33.660
swap a variable um okay but let's see seed so
we'll get some we'll start we'll start with
0:09:33.660,0:09:38.460
some entropy I actually found you don't want
to call seed repeatedly because then you kind
0:09:38.460,0:09:43.920
of even though even though it does introduce some
entropy you're basically starting over and so you
0:09:43.920,0:09:50.460
end up with um it'll often make similar choices
whoops cancel what I don't know what I did okay
0:09:51.600,0:09:56.940
um it'll often make similar choices um so
you just call seed once or intermittently
0:10:00.120,0:10:02.340
okay so then we say um
0:10:04.680,0:10:15.660
seed words equals open file um and we'll
do common words dot text split lines and
0:10:15.660,0:10:22.800
so what this will do is it will open this my
Precision is loaded I changed my mouse resolution
0:10:24.060,0:10:32.940
um so it'll open this and we will grab actually
no I don't need I need sample sample okay
0:10:33.900,0:10:46.680
um and so then uh let's see sampling equals sample
um I think it you put it in seed words and then 10
0:10:46.680,0:10:53.940
and then we'll do print sampling all right let's
make sure I did that right python 20 questions
0:10:55.200,0:11:02.040
there we go okay so basically what we'll
do is we will start with a random sampling
