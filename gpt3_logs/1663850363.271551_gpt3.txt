how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:06:04.320,0:06:08.880
your title your theme your setting your characters
and your plot and then you generate an outline and
0:06:08.880,0:06:15.120
then you generate scenes and so this is much more
structured which means it lends itself to coding
0:06:16.000,0:06:22.000
now obviously this is if it's just recursive
expansion and refinement that also lends itself
0:06:22.000,0:06:25.680
to coding but each of those steps is much messier
so we'll come back to it and that's what this
0:06:25.680,0:06:31.680
this loop is here so you basically you you expand
your story until you get to a point where you're
0:06:31.680,0:06:38.080
satisfied and then you refine it you expand refine
expand refine expand refine until you end up with
0:06:38.080,0:06:43.280
a final product so that is the end loop and that's
going to be a lot of fun to figure out let me tell
0:06:43.280,0:06:50.000
you now with with plotter it's not much different
once you get to the end it's just that you have a
0:06:50.000,0:06:53.840
little bit more structure and a little bit more
planning and then once you get to because all a
0:06:53.840,0:06:58.960
novel is is a list of scenes right so then once
you get to the list of scenes like you've got
0:06:58.960,0:07:03.600
all the scenes written out then you just iterate
over those and refine them and i say that's all
0:07:03.600,0:07:09.440
you do it's not quite that simple um but from
a high level standpoint that's what it is so
0:07:10.240,0:07:15.920
um the auto muse 3 slash the scene and character
simulation that got to this point so what i'm
0:07:15.920,0:07:20.800
going to do is i'm going to go i started a new
repo called plotter novel writer and all i'm
0:07:20.800,0:07:27.200
going to try and do is get to here today so one of
my most popular videos of all time was the movie
0:07:27.200,0:07:36.320
script generator where i already generated um 200
premises um sci-fi romance mystery fantasy um so
0:07:36.320,0:07:44.480
on uh so i copied that and that is here so plotter
novel writer so here we go what i'm going to do is
0:07:44.480,0:07:50.000
i'm just going to try and i'll grab a random
premise random premise and then i'll generate
0:07:50.000,0:07:55.680
title theme setting characters plot um so that's
what i'm going to try and do and i'm just going to
0:07:55.680,0:08:01.360
do like just phase 1 of plotting um today because
that's gonna be i mean that's gonna be enough
