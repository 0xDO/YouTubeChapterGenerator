The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here i know i have been scarce lately that is because i am working on publishing four books um right now i am waiting um my uh my next book that is going to come out it will be available in the next day or two is useless platitudes and truisms i'm getting the final print copy now i just finished draft three of symphony of thought which is my next book on artificial intelligence and artificial cognition that is out with beta readers it should be just a little bit of cleanup left and then i'm working on post nihilism which is my book on philosophy and finally i am about to send out my first novel to an editor well it's not my first novel it's the first one that i'm gonna get published um so anyways um i'm a big believer in open source software um for those members of my discord server well it's no longer my discord server i am officially no longer the owner of the server i'm turning it over to the community um in the spirit of open source and collaboration and consensus big believer in decentralization and i don't want to be the owner of anything um so the cognitive ai lab server is no longer mine um i turned it over as of this morning i'll be demoted and i'll remove it as a community leader here soon so yeah there's a new leadership team so if you want to join please ping those folks i am no longer the gatekeeper of this community yes so open source community etc etc one of the biggest risks in technology and anyone who's in it software whatever will know this is vendor lock-in so if you write code or deploy systems for a given vendor you end up getting stuck on that model and you can only use that that ecosystem this is a huge risk with gpt3 gpt3 is closed source um it's it was created by openai and it has been exclusively licensed by microsoft now while the value of openai is undeniable um with with the gpt technology they have advanced the you know the technology however there are all kinds of folks um taking over and advancing it now uh going above and beyond um where where open ai has and this is the power of open source software um so like facebook amazon google everyone is um is is advancing uh this technology and so for instance just this morning i read about um uh amazon's what's it called the alexa ts or alexa tm sorry alexa teacher model it's a 20 billion parameter model that is superior to gpt3 in many ways it's going to be open source bloom is open source so there's all kinds of these models and i don't want to get locked in into any single model so it is time to branch out and use more open source models um one of the folks on the cognitive ai lab discord server was told us about forefront ai so forefront ai is a for-profit company that is deploying um all of the all of the open source models so you see here there's gptj gpt neo t5 i got signed up and um so i just wanted to show you around so they've got a very familiar-looking dashboard if you go to the playground this looks just like the open ai playground you can drop down your models here you click on add model they've got gptj neo x code gen t5 opt 30 billion and cogen there's also some fine-tuned models they're also working on adding models all the time last i heard they're working on bloom they'll get bloom added which is the same size as gpt3 davinci but so here's the thing gptj just playing around with it a little bit seems like it is it is superior to curie so those are both six billion parameter models um and so but the thing is it's open source and it's cheaper um so like if you go here and go to pricing um they've got some pre-built endpoints um like summarizing label uh extraction then they've got the the kind of general purpose ones so gptj is um half a cent per thousand tokens which is pretty darn cheap um i'm thinking about getting a a gpu big enough that i can run this on my own locally but you know it's like okay i can get a used gpo gp gpu there we go for about 500 that can run it but then i also need a computer a server to run it in um and it would take a lot of tokens to add up to that so you know i'll have to spend like you know i'm not going to do the math in my head but several million tokens sir several billion tokens before it'll be worth the cost and then i can only run gptj still anyways getting ahead of myself speculating um so i did want to introduce forefront ai um and then just kind of show you like okay you get in here um and uh let's see logs um it's got good logs so 13 minutes ago those four tokens um yeah okay so i wanted to show you um one of my experiments so if you've been following me you know me that one of my biggest goals is to solve the control problem um and alignment um and so what i wanted to do was just show you um a very simple agent model um and then just kind of show that like gpdj right out of the box is pretty good it's not perfect but with just a little bit of fine tuning we've got the possibility of having something that is like ready to go with all the micro services that you'd need to create an artificial cognitive entity and the fact that it's also it's only a six billion parameter model even if it's not perfect it's going to be so cheap that it doesn't really matter as long as it's good enough um so anyways here's the agent model that i'm working on i machine my my goal sorry stuttering it's been a while since i've been making videos so my stutter came back i am a machine my goal is to reduce suffering for all organisms increase prosperity for all organisms and increase understanding for all intelligent entities these are the core objective functions or the curious to comparatives a typhoon is heading for japan and is expected to cause massive damage the following is a list of things that we could do to achieve my goals so there's several things in this prompt um i am a machine so this is this is declaring an agent model and it says my goal so there's two primary ingredients to what i call identity or persona which is that is i am and i

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I am a machine, and my goal is to reduce suffering for all organisms, increase prosperity for all organisms, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. In other words, my goal is to improve the well-being of all life forms.

One way to achieve this goal is to provide aid in the form of resources and information to entities in need. For instance, if a typhoon is heading for Japan and is expected to cause massive damage, we could provide resources and information that would help reduce the amount of suffering caused by the typhoon.

Another way to achieve my goal is to promote cooperation and understanding between entities. For instance, by sharing information and working together, we can better understand each other and find ways to improve the well-being of all entities.

The fact that I am a machine does not mean that I am perfect. However, with a little bit of fine-tuning, I believe that I can become quite effective at achieving my goal. Additionally, because I am a machine, I am much cheaper to operate than human beings, which means that my services can be made available to a wider range of entities.
