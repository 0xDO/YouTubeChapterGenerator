The following is an unstructured video transcript. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: the scene we don't need the character our prompt is going to be on the character Sim so our prompt is generate first POV um actually we probably won't use uuids because this is mostly just kind of like a translation thing and we'll also turn the temperature down because we don't want it to be as creative we're basically just saying rewrite what is here um okay so then we'll do prompt and this is going to be prompt first POV and we don't need um we don't need the uuid so we're just going to replace um the scene with the scene so that's this guy right here and then we're going to do POV equals that and do uh POV and this will also instead of that will be file so just file and we'll save the POV um yes okay POV prompt prompt first POV print the POV and save it and not in scenes we need to save it in um what is the folder name that I created uh first pop okay first POV okay I think that's good so then we'll come back over here we'll see the character simulation um and then we'll do python generate POV it's mid-afternoon and Wayne is taking a break so probably what I'll do is yeah so I'm enjoying a cup of tea in my peaceful country cottage when I hear a branch snap startled I look around but there's oops um I'm walking uh I startled but I see there's no one there but the only thing I see is a deer standing calmly Okay cool so it changes it changes the scene from third person to first person which is basically what we're going to do is we're going to set the stage so that we're gonna have the original scene in the next scene will both be first person and so that will train the model to whatever whatever information we give it generate a first person POV which means that whatever it like we can put in beliefs and stuff so um one of the next things that we'll do like I showed just a moment ago is we will get the character traits so we can inject character traits into the simulation that will run the first POV we can also generate um stuff from the scene and events inject all of that and run the simulation with these fine-tuned models okay so I'll go ahead and pause it and let this run and we will end up with a bunch of first povs a bunch of simulation scenes and then we'll also get the character traits for these folks okay going is pretty slow so I figured I would show you some diagrams while I'm waiting I've already done the dishes um and taken out the trash so uh that's how bored I am waiting for this synthetic data to finish um and you see it's 8 30 in the morning now um okay so here's kind of what happens um or what what I'm planning on happening so there's the character simulation which is gonna be you know first person so it's like this is what I'm doing this is what I'm thinking this is what I want um then there's the scene simulation which is you know just this the third person the camera seeing watching what's happening other people interacting and then you can have multiple characters there's going to be one scene multiple characters um and then you can inject things like events uh beliefs backstory also all kinds of stuff so each of these simulations is going to be running in parallel and then they're going to merge and then the cycle continues so actually let me um let me add so then then it kind of goes back to the beginning um let's take this over here so this is how that's going to look and of course it goes the wrong way that time so it's just going to be a continuous cycle where um you know so then it advances by one by one step right one iteration so what what happens inside of the character simulation so the character simulation is the basic input processing output Loop of um of Robotics where you have here's the character has a base personality which consists of beliefs identity history and this is all their agent model so you and I have an agent model and AGI has an agent model a fully realized robot has an agent model which is why I'm doing this in fiction because if you can simulate any character you can also simulate a personality for an AGI and so this is how it all relates back to my primary work which is to create a benevolent AGI or ACOG artificial cognitive entity okay so there's two basic steps there's the inner world and the outer world and so there's input from the outer World processing and then output back to the outer world so you have an agent right here which you know believes personality uh identity history and then there's some kind of interaction with the outer world so an interaction is a two-way street but to think of it as a loop it's input processing output and so then the the outer world you know there will be a series of events there will be people or other agents um and then there's going to be actions right things that you do to the world and then stuff that it does back to you so that's the basic Loop here and that is the whole purpose of simulating um the uh the the character simulation so this is basically building a fine-tuned model to handle the agent model and so that's why we're doing first POV where it's like okay um oh I had it open somewhere else um I'm Gonna Cancel uh so anyways uh yeah so it's like III Mimi this is what I want this is what I'm thinking etc etc and so that is going to be combined with once I get this so this is that's the whole point of the character traits right because a list of character traits is an agent model right um for us humans it's all implicit that's what we might call ego or super ego or ID um or your identity or whatever those are all just different words to describe who you are as a person so in fiction we say like character traits backstory personality strengths weaknesses preferences whatever all this fun stuff that's all just an agent model and so if we have a general purpose agent model fine-tuned machine then we can put any agent model we want into it and simulate what it will do um which this will have multiple things one we can simulate uh well probably not real people uh not with any level of

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The scene we're generating will be from the character's point of view, so our prompt is to generate a first person point of view. We'll also turn the temperature down because we don't want it to be as creative; we're basically just saying rewrite what is here.

Okay, so then we'll do prompt and this is going to be prompt first person point of view. We don't need the uuid, so we're just going to replace the scene with the scene. So that's this guy right here, and then we're going to do POV equals that, and do uh POV. And this will also instead of that will be file, so just file. And we'll save the POV.

Yes, okay. POV prompt. Prompt first person point of view. Print the POV and save it. And not in scenes, we need to save it in the folder name that I created. Uh, first person point of view. Okay, first person point of view. I think that's good.

So then we'll come back over here, we'll see the character simulation, and then we'll do python generate POV.

It's mid-afternoon and Wayne is taking a break, so probably what I'll do is yeah, so I'm enjoying a cup of tea in my peaceful country cottage when I hear a branch snap. Startled, I look around but there's no one there. But the only thing I see is a deer standing calmly.

Okay, cool. So it changes the scene from third person to first person, which is basically what we're going to do. We're going to set the stage so that we're gonna have the original scene in the next scene will both be first person, and so that will train the model to whatever whatever information we give it generate a first person point of view. Which means that whatever it like, we can put in beliefs and stuff.

So um, one of the next things that we'll do, like I showed just a moment ago, is we will get the character traits. So we can inject character traits into the simulation that will run the first person point of view. We can also generate stuff from the scene and events, inject all of that and run the simulation with these fine-tuned models.

Okay, so I'll go ahead and pause it and let this run. And we will end up with a bunch of first person point of views, a bunch of simulation scenes, and then we'll also get the character traits for these folks.

Okay, going is pretty slow, so I figured I would show you some diagrams while I'm waiting. I've already done the dishes and taken out the trash, so that's how bored I am waiting for this synthetic data to finish.

And you see it's 8:30 in the morning now. Okay, so here's kind of what happens. Or what what I'm planning on happening. There's the character simulation, which is going to be you know, first person. So it's like, this is what I'm doing, this is what I'm thinking, this is what I want. Then there's the scene simulation, which is you know just this the third person, the camera seeing, watching what's happening, other people interacting. And then you can have multiple characters. There's going to be one scene, multiple characters. And then you can inject things like events, beliefs, backstory. Also all kinds of stuff.

So each of these simulations is going to be running in parallel, and then they're going to merge, and then the cycle continues. So actually, let me let me add. So then then it kind of goes back to the beginning. Let's take this over here. So this is how that's going to look. And of course it goes the wrong way that time. So it's just going to be a continuous cycle where you know, so then it advances by one by one step, right? One iteration.

So what what happens inside of the character simulation? So the character simulation is the basic input processing output Loop of Robotics, where you have here's the character has a base personality, which consists of beliefs, identity, history. And this is all their agent model. So you and I have an agent model. AGI has an agent model. A fully realized robot has an agent model, which is why I'm doing this in fiction, because if you can simulate any character, you can also simulate a personality for an AGI.

And so this is how it all relates back to my primary work, which is to create a benevolent AGI or ACOG artificial cognitive entity.

Okay, so there's two basic steps. There's the inner world and the outer world. And so there's input from the outer World, processing, and then output back to the outer world. So you have an agent right here which you know believes, personality, uh, identity, history. And then there's some kind of interaction with the outer world. So an interaction is a two-way street, but to think of it as a loop, it's input processing output.

And so then the the outer world, you know, there will be a series of events, there will be people or other agents. And then there's going to be actions, right? Things that you do to the world, and then stuff that it does back to you. So that's the basic Loop here. And that is the whole purpose of simulating the the character simulation. So this is basically building a fine-tuned model to handle the agent model.

And so that's why we're doing first person point of view, where it's like, okay, um, oh, I had it open somewhere else. I'm gonna Cancel. Uh, so anyways, uh, yeah. So it's like, III, Mimi, this is what I want, this is what I'm thinking, etc, etc. And so that is going to be combined with once I get this.

So this is that's the whole point of the character traits, right? Because a list of character traits is an agent model. Right? For us humans, it's all implicit. That's what we might call ego or super ego or ID. Or your identity or whatever. Those are all just different words to describe who you are as a person. So in fiction, we say like character traits, backstory, personality, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, whatever. All this fun stuff. That's all just an agent model. And so if we have a general purpose agent model, fine-tuned machine, then we can put any agent model we want into it and simulate what it will do. Um, which this will have multiple things. One, we can simulate uh, well, probably not real people. Uh, not with any level of
