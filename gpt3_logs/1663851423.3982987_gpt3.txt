how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:00:00.540,0:00:05.520
morning everybody this is David Shapiro um
today we're going to continue working on auto
0:00:05.520,0:00:11.220
Muse 3 but what we're going to do is we're
going to do a fine tuning project because
0:00:12.000,0:00:19.560
um as many of you were observed um Auto Muse 3
didn't work too so well that's fine this is a
0:00:19.560,0:00:25.560
research project so what I'm doing is I'm breaking
out into scene simulation so basically what I'm
0:00:25.560,0:00:33.240
going to try and do is create a fine-tuned model
that will simulate just the scene aspect so we'll
0:00:33.240,0:00:40.560
see how well it does but basically it's the
idea is you give it a scene and then it just
0:00:40.560,0:00:47.940
kind of advances you know whatever happens next
in that scene and then we'll do something similar
0:00:47.940,0:00:55.440
for maybe characters or events not sure yet but
that's the point of experimentation so anyways I
0:00:55.440,0:01:00.480
was trying to do it with just prompt engineering
and it was Ultra frustrating so I'm gonna go more
0:01:00.480,0:01:07.860
more conventional fine tuning so what I'm doing
is I've got I'm generating synthetic data first
0:01:08.580,0:01:13.860
so what I'm going to do is I've got this prompt
where it says use your imagination to describe
0:01:13.860,0:01:18.120
the following scene and setting in great detail
we want to see a play-by-play of what's going on
0:01:18.120,0:01:23.220
in this environment Advanced narrative what is
going on here so I give it a location a time a
0:01:23.220,0:01:28.860
character and detailed description of the scene in
events and some of you notice in previous videos
0:01:28.860,0:01:36.000
uh something that I do to add more entropy is I
add uuid at the top this creates internal entropy
0:01:36.000,0:01:40.140
inside of the model so that you're going to
get less repetition so basically I've got
0:01:40.140,0:01:45.840
this is completely random and then three other
variables which are populated here so I've got
0:01:45.840,0:01:53.160
11 locations seven times a day and then nine
characters and I tried to get a little bit
0:01:53.160,0:01:57.420
more Global because here's the thing if you just
ask gpt3 to Generate random characters they're
0:01:57.420,0:02:04.260
all going to be like vanilla white people so I
added Michonne swathi Wang Alexi and Gabby just
