0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:21:33.920,0:21:40.000
i need to do is change the prompt um so we'll go
to this so this is this is one advantage actually
0:21:40.000,0:21:46.880
no that won't work because i only load the prompt
once um yeah so for every iteration if i move this
0:21:46.880,0:21:52.880
up into the into the loop then i could just change
the prompt mid flight so actually let's do that
0:21:54.080,0:22:00.480
um so let's do that put that here so now while
it's iterating i can change the prompt mid-flight
0:22:00.480,0:22:06.480
without having to cancel it um that'll be
nice long day of work to her loving fiance
0:22:06.480,0:22:16.000
miles um jenna and the stranger when olivia's
mom dies she's left to fend for herself um so
0:22:16.000,0:22:21.360
this is all this is all very like anglo-centric
these are all like typical pretty much typically
0:22:21.360,0:22:28.560
american names these aren't even like european
names um so let me go ahead and pause this now
0:22:30.480,0:22:34.480
and let's add a little bit of variety
but first we're going to want to
0:22:34.480,0:22:41.200
change where it starts okay so we're at
16 so let's go here and we'll start um
0:22:42.400,0:22:49.040
we'll go we'll start at 17 and we'll go up
to uh let's see let's we'll just go up to 30.
0:22:49.840,0:22:57.120
and then we'll change this to uh let's close that
one so i stopped clicking on it um for brainstorm
0:22:57.120,0:23:02.880
a detailed plot synopsis for a random romance
let's say europe no let's say french romance story
0:23:03.600,0:23:08.160
um and watch how much just
one word changes this output
0:23:10.240,0:23:18.080
and let's see make sure that i change the where it
starts so it'll go from 17 to 30. uh okay that'll
0:23:18.080,0:23:25.840
be fine okay so because basically what we're
doing now is we're oh elise there we go dashing
0:23:25.840,0:23:32.160
parisian gentleman pierre oh wonderful um okay
so what we're doing is we're generating synthetic
0:23:33.280,0:23:38.960
data right now so ultimately this will be the
input that we use in the future why is it paused
0:23:38.960,0:23:46.160
there we go oh wow that's a much longer one
excellent um so you know we got 17 like you
0:23:46.160,0:23:53.760
know white bred american um premise romance plots
um and we're gonna use those to generate um like a
