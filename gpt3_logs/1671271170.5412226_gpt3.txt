0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:08.580,0:04:13.620
about social issues what about things that people
care about I mean you people care about money and
0:04:13.620,0:04:18.120
their ability to feed themselves but there's
other issues right like there's fundamental
0:04:18.120,0:04:23.640
disagreements over like corporate personhood and
abortion rights and privacy rights and you can't
0:04:23.640,0:04:30.120
model that with money um these are these are these
are emotional issues these are spiritual issues
0:04:30.120,0:04:36.600
and uh they're racial issues they're issues of
social justice and you know you ask an economist
0:04:36.600,0:04:39.600
what's important and they say it's only the money
that's important that was the most infuriating
0:04:39.600,0:04:43.680
part about talking to my brother-in-laws
if it wasn't in the market it didn't matter
0:04:44.580,0:04:48.120
um and I'm like that's not how reality works
but you know he's an economist Nobody's Perfect
0:04:49.440,0:04:55.380
um anyways so the whole point of this now
that you've had the the had the stage set
0:04:55.380,0:04:57.840
for you and I know that this is long and
rambling but you know what you all love
0:04:57.840,0:05:02.100
my longer videos and this is a very this
is an issue that is near and dear to me
0:05:02.820,0:05:05.820
um and actually I've got an interview
a podcast coming up that talks about
0:05:05.820,0:05:12.120
amongst other things consensus so I'm kind of
setting the stage for that now okay so Dave
0:05:12.120,0:05:17.700
you're crazy you're you can't use an AI machine
to simulate human emotions and what people want
0:05:18.840,0:05:23.280
um well just sit tight and see and wait till the
end of the video and then let me know what you
0:05:23.280,0:05:32.340
think all right so I started let me show you where
I started I started with um just a few experiments
0:05:32.340,0:05:40.140
so under the examples test01 um so I I created
a little you know dossier of someone right just
0:05:40.140,0:05:44.280
key demographics right adasi for the following
person here let me zoom in on this a little bit
0:05:45.600,0:05:49.620
um the goal is to capture enough information about
this person to perform market research political
0:05:49.620,0:05:54.780
surveys etc etc so income hundred thousand
dollars occupation trucker State Oregon white
0:05:54.780,0:06:01.500
56 detail dossier it basically just restated um
you know what I said he's likely to be a blue
0:06:01.500,0:06:05.700
collar worker who's politically conservative
and socially traditional so that was that was
0:06:05.700,0:06:10.860
some interesting value added intuited that
he's probably a gun owner and enjoys hunting
0:06:10.860,0:06:16.320
and fishing because he's a white older white guy
or middle-aged white guy from Oregon um who who
0:06:16.320,0:06:22.080
has a um I don't I mean Trucking Trucking it you
have to be licensed for that I don't know if I'd
0:06:22.080,0:06:27.540
call that blue blue collar um but it's not what
you'd call a knowledge worker a skilled labor he's
0:06:27.540,0:06:31.740
likely to be suspicious of government and wary
of foreign countries he's a Christian and goes
0:06:31.740,0:06:37.380
to church regularly his family man who's married
with Children um yeah so you know stereotypes
0:06:37.380,0:06:42.300
exist for a reason and I was like okay this is
this is okay but there's no Nuance to this right
0:06:42.300,0:06:48.780
this is just a statistical likelihood so I was
not happy with this example I'm like okay so we
0:06:48.780,0:06:56.700
just proved that you know with a few data points
gpt3 understands stereotypes that's not I mean yes
0:06:59.160,0:07:06.180
there are there are people that study sociology
and psychology and like there is some there is
0:07:06.180,0:07:12.360
some validity to stereotypes but we don't want to
reward that so I tried again um and it you know
0:07:12.360,0:07:16.020
I was like okay what are his political views what
is what are their social views what are his other
0:07:16.020,0:07:20.820
interests and again it was very stereotypical so
not helpful we're not getting any Nuance from this
0:07:21.900,0:07:28.020
um so then I was like okay what's a world view
like can we can we do this on scalars and so then
0:07:28.020,0:07:34.260
I added a whole bunch more things because I was
just thinking through like okay you know income
0:07:34.260,0:07:41.400
skin color age you know some basic demographics
like but what about their personality can we get
0:07:41.400,0:07:47.400
Nuance by adding in someone's personality and so
I created a bunch of scalars where so it goes from
0:07:47.400,0:07:53.940
like one to ten and unlike you know selfish to
generous and curious or incurious to curious and
