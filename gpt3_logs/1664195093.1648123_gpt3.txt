The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here um i have been taking a break from making youtube videos uh primarily because i'm working on writing my books um uh but anyways the uh inflation reduction act just came out and um i wanted to look at it so i downloaded it i downloaded the whole thing it's right here um it is let's see uh 15 000 lines long 835 000 characters 730ish pages in the pdf uh yeah so um that's what i got and i'm feeding it through my recursive summarizer which i made a video about this before um i summarized the recent roe v wade decision um and then i also summarized alice in wonderland down to 55 characters so anyways as a reminder it's pretty simple all it does is it uses a python module called text wrap and it breaks it into 2000 character long chunks and then for each chunk it summarizes it and then what you can do is then you take that summary and then you feed it back in and so what i'm doing it right now this is the first pass is i'm taking those 2000 character chunks and writing concise summaries so let me show you the um the prompts that i use so the prompt is super simple it just says write a concise summary of the following summary and then concise summary so by wrapping it in those instructions you get very consistent results especially with um with uh the instruct series of gpd3 again here's the input so the output will look like this it'll take let's see 800 thousand characters divided by two thousand that's forty if i'm doing my math correct um let's see eight hundred thousand characters divided by two thousand four hundred okay uh so it'll take four four hundred recursions but it will also drastically reduce the length so what we'll do is once this is done i'll do it again and i'll show you so anyways i'm going to pause the video wait for this to finish then we'll do the follow-up the follow-up ones one thing that i added to make it easier is that i added a timestamp to the output which means that i don't have to like rename the files manually it'll just put them out automatically so instead of the output here it'll be output then with the time stamp so they'll all be in sequential order anyways i'm going to pause the video we'll come back once we once we get the uh next phase done um yeah i wanted to just kind of walk you through kind of what i'm seeing um there's a lot of tax credits in this uh just watching some of these roll through um there's renewable energy tax credits there's extensions of older tax credits um let's see let me drag this up a little bit um energy audit tax credit 15 energy star criteria um i mean this is very comprehensive there's a lot of stuff in here um so you know sure i'm when you're summarizing something and i don't you know i don't i'm not a policy expert i'm sure there's stuff that's that's missing or um hidden or whatever but i mean you see tax credit tax credit tax credit i'll do a control f a search and just look at how many tax credits um are listed in this uh but this seems like it is very comprehensible like it is what it says that it is um there is also a lot on medicare um and medicine and and other things but it like so for instance in this section you know social security act social security act um amendments to the social security act uh medicare coverage vaccines low-income subsidies right there's obviously i haven't looked at this comprehensively um but you know i'm not seeing anything out of the ordinary yet not like oh hey we're also going to dedicate you know like 15 billion dollars to like ufo research or something but there might be um anyways so yeah i just wanted to kind of make that observation as it's going all these files will be available on the um on the github repo once this is done okay gang the first pass is done um it will be saved up in the repo here ira underscore 2022 166 etcetera etcetera that's just the time stamp um but let me show you so the input was here um 835 000 lines or characters fifteen thousand six hundred lines um now it is down to a hundred and seventy two thousand characters uh 793 lines um that's still about thirty six thousand words i think um yeah thirty six thousand five hundred ninety five words on average probably a little bit less because the average word length is uh much longer here than in like fiction but anyways so this is obviously still not sustainable um so let's go ahead and plug this back in and then we'll rerun it so i i added a little bit more output for the uh for the script so you can see how long you've got left so let me show you recursively summarize so this should take yep 87 so the senate passed a bill etc etc so now we're going to get the second second pass anyways so let's see what did i say like tax credit so find all in current document so there are 77 tax credits listed in this one um so that's interesting um there's all kinds of stuff from like stuff for the national park service there's epa clean air act right gas air pollution implementation there's all kinds of like let's see if there's electric vehicle let's see find all in current documents so electric vehicles are mentioned four different times um electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles uh capped at 7 500. uh you know there's that kind of stuff let's see if it mentions insulin yep the bilamins the patient protection and affordable care act to treat cost sharing for covered insulin um there you go so there's all this kind of fun stuff solar solar is mentioned a whole bunch of times find all in current document 23 hits um yep so there you go um this should be going a bit faster um so this is one thing is as you recursively summarize it gets more and more condensed um so we're at uh stage 19 20 out of 87 so this will only take a few more minutes um and it'll all again it'll all be saved so i'll just pause the video again and i'll run this a couple more times and just show you that you can look through each each iteration yourself all right we're making making some good progress we've got um the

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Inflation Reduction Act was recently released, and it is a large and comprehensive bill. I summarized it using my recursive summarizer, which breaks it down into 2000 character chunks and then summarizes each chunk.

The act contains many tax credits, extensions of older tax credits, and provisions for Medicare and other medical care. It is very comprehensive, but there may be some things hidden in the bill that are not immediately apparent.

I will continue to run my summarizer on the bill until it is more concise and manageable. All of the summary files will be available on my GitHub repository.
