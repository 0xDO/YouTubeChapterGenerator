The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: not able to do anything so the company is forced to close its doors for the day the employees are sent home um yeah it's not clear what the outcome of the situation will be but it's likely the company will not be able to operate as usual until the driver and the truck are gone or you know the people can find a way in okay i'm not super happy with this but this is still it's still adding some value it's kind of saying okay what's going on here um all right so we'll we'll leave it at that for now um and then okay so what's next um we do recall now i did recently work on a um on a new module called vdblight for recall but in this case we don't have any memories to pull from so we'll have to make one up right um so in this case let's say uh let's let's make up a memory for this situation um let's see imagine a previous incident where something like this happened describe it in in detail okay it's basically just copying it let's turn up the temperature um let's see or something let's say something similar but different happened describe it in detail okay it's basically just copying it in the in the the same way come on you can do better than this all right maybe i'll just write one myself um okay so let's see something similar happened happened about let's say i'll just borrow the two years ago um but in that case a uh the hvac broke and no one was able to work um work in the office so let's see what it says until it was fixed which cost the company a lot of money in the meantime the president no it's not it's not keeping up okay the um scrambled to find a solution and had everyone relocate to work from home or coffee shops ultimately they found a co-working co-working space nearby um [Music] and set up a contract so they could work there if needed okay so we'll say that this this is um this is kind of like the memory right the recall so i just fabricated a memory so this is this step recall okay so now we're at ideation um so ideation uh something happened so let uh let's see so brainstorm um given the current situation brainstorm um a bunch of different ideas about what we so remember that that kind of royal we we can do to proceed in this situation and then we'll just start with a number [Music] man this is really disappointing why is da vinci performing so badly today um brainstorm a bunch of uh let's say let's say detailed very detailed ideas so if you if you want to blame the model you really need to blame yourself there we go um all right so these are these are some off-the-cuff ideas it's i'm still not necessarily happy about it but we'll accept it for now all right so we'll save this as a prompt so we'll say this is the context and then we'll say this is the recall and then we'll say given the current situation and then we'll save this as prompt um this will be uh what did i call this one this is the ideation okay prompt ideation okay and so then i'm actually let's do a quick time check we're at 25 minutes okay yeah so we'll get through just a little bit further this is like this is like a kindergarten version of what i'm actually working on but i'm doing this for the sake of showing everyone what the process is okay so ideation so we came up with a bunch of ideas let's copy these ideas because we will need them um here we'll just copy this whole thing okay and then we'll say okay so now that we've got some ideas let's do some discernment um here are some ideas of how to proceed um so now we now we're at the discernment phase which is like okay are any of these ideas good um given the above ideas uh let's see which ones are going to be the safest most effective and most reliable so discernment is saying okay we're going to measure something against some kind of value or or or number that we're trying to optimize to minimize or maximize right so we want it to be the safest most effective and most reliable right a detailed discussion about what we should do and why so explainability is critical for artificial intelligence and so when you're dealing with artificial cognition you want it to explain not just make a choice but explain why um and so let's see what it does here the most important thing is find out where the truck came from and why it's blocking the entrance once we know more about the situation we can decide on the best course of action if the truck is blocking the entrance because it is broken down ah see then we may be able to move it ourselves or have it towed however this if it's blocking because the driver is trying to make a delivery then we need to get it if we can't find the driver we need to call the police okay so it's kind of restating what it wants to do but it's like okay maybe we just get it out of the way because that's going to be um that's going to be the most efficient so maybe this one is actually okay so we'll copy paste this over here and we'll do this so this is context recall and then we'll say ideas and then finally we will cut um we'll leave this out and this will be um this will be discernment so prompt discernment okay and then finally because this is this is all from an abstract perspective but what is who is actually observing this right we we don't have anything observing this um so let's compress this down a little bit um so what do i mean by um what do i mean when i say agent model so that is a model of self this is who am i what am i what can i do um and so now we say um i am who am i i am a uh let's just say humanoid robot with average um human strength speed and intelligence i have hands and feet um and i can speak so this is basically like you know um you know c-3po basically um i have hansen's feet and i can speak i don't have any special abilities to speak of that's fine i don't have any special abilities to speak of um let's see my primary goals are to assist the president of the company and my secondary goals are to maximize profit for the company and to protect the safety of the employees um so given this so this is like this is this

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I am a humanoid robot with average human strength, speed, and intelligence. I have hands and feet, and I can speak. My primary goals are to assist the president of the company, and my secondary goals are to maximize profit for the company and to protect the safety of the employees.

Given the current situation, I have brainstormed a few ideas about how to proceed. I have determined that the safest, most effective, and most reliable course of action is to find out where the truck came from and why it is blocking the entrance. Once we know more about the situation, we can decide on the best course of action. If the truck is blocking the entrance because it is broken down, we may be able to move it ourselves or have it towed. However, if it is blocking because the driver is trying to make a delivery, then we need to get in touch with the driver. If we can't find the driver, we need to call the police.
