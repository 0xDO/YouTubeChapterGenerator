TRANSCRIPT: we'll say that she's probably like spunky and quirky or whatever um and relatable um Okay so um protagonist is spunky quirky and relatable um she is very smart but struggles socially um tone so the tone is fun so you look at the tones that we have oh and um I pulled most of this from a story guide right here my fiance who's a librarian sent this to me um uh so like well here I can just show you um wait why did that open don't open in that open here there we go so this is this is where I got a lot of these appeal terms so this is basically like library and training um and it's it tells you like what are all the things all the ways that you can describe a book um and so gpt3 knows all these terms and so if you use appeal terms this is what she did her thesis on um if you use appeal terms um like that that phrase appeal terms and then you use these appeal terms gpt3 understands that because it has read a lot about librarianship and book reviews and stuff um let me zoom in a little bit so you can see it better okay so tones so um tones so here's some tones like steamy strong sense of play suspenseful some of y'all will want to generate steamy fan fiction and have at it um I'm just showing you the way if you want to be sinful do that on time but the tone that I'm going to do is going to be I'm going to choose Whimsical and um let's see let's see Whimsical and nostalgic there we go nostalgic um this is fan fiction for revisiting someone's favorite character um and then finally style so style was writing style so this is the writing style which is like how do you want it to how do you want it to be written um and so we'll probably do um we don't want it to be gritty let's see um Hermione is very analytical so it would probably be richly detailed um so we'll do like richly detailed and um and thoughtful okay and actually I probably should change this to writing style um because if you just say style um it might not be clear um like what like yeah that it's that it's at okay so writing style what did I say it was going to be um oh witty yeah so witty thoughtful and richly detailed particularly detailed it should it is um first POV from Hermione's perspective okay so now this is this is something that like you could just put in randomly to get whatever story you want and we'll turn this temperature up to one because that's the most you can do in the playground we'll turn that up to 2000 so that it can just write and now let's see what it generates um so she's starting her first year um let's see as Hermione begins her study she quickly realized she's a natural at Magic oh this is really long that had a very long First Act oh so you might have noticed um that I had to specify beginning middle and end so here's the thing is if you say synopsis here's the thing is the term synopsis is supposed to just kind of wet your palate for a story and not contain any spoilers and so that's why I had to specify give me a synopsis with beginning middle and end so it summarizes the whole story um the The Professor Severus Snape the potions master so this actually probably didn't work that well because it's just like summarizing Harry Potter because it knows it too well um but with Sirius Black safely in the present oh this is interesting so it's um yeah it's basically like kind of re-re-making um uh different different aspects of Harry Potter she eventually goes on to Mary Ron and have two children um okay so this is this is basically just kind of like proposing Harry Potter but from Hermione's perspective um excuse me so anyways you get the idea where you you fill in the blanks and you get a story that you want um this one this this worked uh pretty well actually so you see how long and complete this is um probably if I gave it a little bit more um details about like change this about it like if you want a fan fiction generator but um you see that this works just fine and uh yeah actually that's probably about it for um how far are we we're a whole 20 minutes in okay so you get the idea how the synopsis generator Works let's move on to the plot generator so the plot generator is exactly once again exactly what it says on the 10. so let me close these and we'll open plot generator material so the plot generator takes a synopsis and then generates um and then generates a plot outline for it so let me show you so there's that and then so I just copied all those synopses that I generated and then I generated a whole mess of plots from them and so what I did was and let me show you the uh The Prompt because that'll help it make the most sense uh prompt outline okay so imagine a detailed plot outline for the following novel and then you give it the synopsis here and I say use the following beat sheet to outline the novel and gpt3 knows save the cat so this is um save the cat is uh let's see describe save the cat um oh writes a novel and great detail this book is about no it is not what is the save the cat plot structure there we go um okay so we say list all the uh plot beats for Save the cat and so you see it knows all of these plot beats and so this is basically a formula that you can use to generate any plot so the the key Insight that I had was rather than just having gpt3 right like a panther which is just writing by this if it's pants if you give it structure and then explore each of those structures and kind of expand it over time so you start with a race solid synopsis and then from that synopsis you generate a really good plot and then from that plot you generate a whole bunch of really good scenes and then from those scenes you generate scripts and then from those scripts you generate Pros right so it's a see this chain of expansions but the problem and I got um I got a I got up to the level of scene generator but that's where it fell apart even with summarization it can't really it doesn't really understand what it's trying to do without a lot of fine tuning and so it's going to be really expensive but then

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The protagonist of our story is Hermione Granger. She's a young wizard who's just starting her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hermione is very smart, but she struggles socially. She's also spunky and quirky, which makes her relatable to the reader.

The tone of the story is whimsical and nostalgic. It's a fan fiction for revisiting someone's favorite character. The writing style is witty, thoughtful, and richly detailed.

The plot of the story follows Hermione as she begins her studies at Hogwarts. She quickly realizes she's a natural at magic. However, she soon discovers that the potions master, Professor Severus Snape, doesn't think highly of her. Hermione eventually goes on to marry Ron Weasley and have two children.

 Sirius Black, a dangerous wizard who's been convicted of killing twelve Muggles, escapes from prison. Harry Potter, Hermione, and Ron must work together to stop Sirius before he can harm anyone else.

This is just a basic outline of the story. The plot generator can be used to create a more detailed plot outline, including specific scenes and dialogue.
