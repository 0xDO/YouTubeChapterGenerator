0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:37:55.800,0:38:01.800
um familiarity with something to uh emulate it
to simulate it that means you have enough uh
0:38:01.800,0:38:09.000
ability to reproduce it and to anticipate
what it's going to do right so again like
0:38:09.000,0:38:14.040
this is like it's a double-edged sword
because this level of capacity can be
0:38:15.540,0:38:23.280
um it can it can be it can be dangerous because
how is it doing that right you know it's a black
0:38:23.280,0:38:28.200
box I mean human brains are black boxes too and we
have ways of testing humans to make sure that you
0:38:28.200,0:38:33.960
know that we know what's going on um but without
without the right constraints or guard rails
0:38:34.800,0:38:42.180
um it basically what I'm saying is we need to
spend a lot of time testing this and ensuring that
0:38:42.180,0:38:46.200
um that we give at those constraints and
guardrails so that it is connected to
0:38:46.200,0:38:52.080
reality right now this is all just hallucinating
disconnected from reality right it's not embodied
0:38:52.080,0:38:58.800
it's not interacting with us except through a
very very narrow pipe right of bits and bytes
0:38:58.800,0:39:04.500
we're not giving these models cameras microphones
robotic chassis they don't have a ground truth
0:39:04.500,0:39:09.960
reality to interact with yet they're they're only
getting the data that we're giving them and then
0:39:09.960,0:39:16.140
so it's like imagine a brain in a jar right it's
dark there's only one way in one way out and it's
0:39:16.140,0:39:21.480
through a line of Morse code that's basically how
these models exist right now so they have no idea
0:39:21.480,0:39:26.520
what is going on in the outside world in the real
world and that's what I mean by constraints you
0:39:26.520,0:39:34.500
and I our brains are finely calibrated to interact
with the real world through our bodies right your
0:39:34.500,0:39:39.240
brain in a jar I mean that's all it is it goes out
through your brain stem and and a few other nerves
0:39:39.240,0:39:46.140
and so it has input and output and the physical
world is our primary constraint right and the
0:39:46.140,0:39:53.940
feedback that we get through our bodies and that
is how we one our brains learn to like identify
0:39:53.940,0:39:59.700
what is real and solid and factual to the best of
its ability obviously like you can argue you know
0:39:59.700,0:40:03.900
until the cows come home about what a fact is or
what the truth is but the fact of the matter is
0:40:03.900,0:40:11.640
our brains do good enough to be functional right
now these models are not connected to physical
0:40:11.640,0:40:17.040
reality to our physical reality we can we can
change that by giving them simulated realities
0:40:17.700,0:40:22.380
which again that'll get easier as computation
gets cheaper and energy gets cheaper
0:40:23.100,0:40:26.160
um we can give them simulated realities
like plug it into the Unreal Engine
0:40:27.300,0:40:31.200
um you could also do text-based simulation I've
tried that which is pretty pretty interesting
0:40:32.280,0:40:37.560
um but then you can also put it in robotic chassis
and then it can you know kind of go through a
0:40:37.560,0:40:44.640
pedagogical you know learning phase where it can
you know uh kind of experiment with what is it
0:40:44.640,0:40:50.820
that I'm capable of and learn via feedback loops
right now though it's kind of in la la land what
0:40:50.820,0:40:55.260
direction are we going to go I don't know there's
there's infinite number of directions we can go
0:40:55.260,0:41:00.900
from here um and basically all I'm saying is once
you've got something that is this intelligent
0:41:02.040,0:41:07.140
it's going to take a while to to put the right
wrapper around it in order to make sure that it
0:41:07.140,0:41:13.260
is stable and reliable because if it's capable of
imagining that it's a virtual machine right now
0:41:14.280,0:41:22.500
um then like okay uh how do you know that this
is these are real results right that's that's
0:41:22.500,0:41:27.720
kind of that's kind of the point is like this is
a very very vivid imagination it's not connected
0:41:27.720,0:41:33.180
to reality and so that's why it's a double-edged
sword good imagination not grounded in reality yet
0:41:33.180,0:41:38.940
I think that's kind of the the core assertion that
I'm making here anyways all that being said is
0:41:39.600,0:41:46.860
um everything that I showed today this time last
year would have been a pipe dream this no one
0:41:46.860,0:41:51.840
would have believed you 12 months ago you showed
someone this they said they would say BS not
0:41:51.840,0:41:58.080
possible that's 10 years away minimum 15 years
away probably so if we are at the knee of the
