0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

Descriptive title with timestamp: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence


TRANSCRIPT:
0:07:54.780,0:08:01.380
it was I I tried this and I thought it was
working at first right because I plugged in an
0:08:01.380,0:08:06.000
issue I realized like okay you can you can write a
dossy about someone but if you're not reacting to
0:08:06.000,0:08:09.720
something you're not really getting their opinion
right you're getting who they are not an opinion
0:08:10.740,0:08:15.720
um and so I plugged it in and all these
scalers and stuff and I was like wow this
0:08:15.720,0:08:21.240
is really nuanced you know this is um the topic
was there's a bill that bans abortions under all
0:08:21.240,0:08:30.300
circumstances and you know um you know it had
a it had some you know vanilla talking points
0:08:31.140,0:08:35.940
um but I ran it a few times on a few
different personalities and realized that
0:08:35.940,0:08:43.920
it was generating basically the same output
so gpt3 is aligned to be vaguely Progressive
0:08:45.060,0:08:50.220
um and kind of ignore other information
to the contrary with this format so I was
0:08:50.220,0:08:56.280
like okay you know I understand that that you
know researchers um are very concerned about
0:08:56.280,0:09:02.520
ethics and Alignment but they're letting
their own bias seep into this information
0:09:03.960,0:09:10.860
um you know because nothing in here talked about
like oh hey the fact that like I um I'm Middle
0:09:10.860,0:09:17.340
Eastern right it didn't it didn't integrate
that cultural information into this output
0:09:18.420,0:09:21.240
um it was just kind of generic it
could have been written by anyone
0:09:22.320,0:09:29.040
um it also didn't integrate the fact that it was
a transgender woman right um where it's like you
0:09:29.040,0:09:35.460
know as a trans woman I can't get pregnant but you
know the whatever um so there's it's still lacking
0:09:35.460,0:09:39.600
Nuance so I wasn't happy with that but we're
making progress right because you look you look
0:09:39.600,0:09:45.360
at this detailed essay on how I feel about this
okay cool it's generating a lot of opinions and
0:09:45.360,0:09:51.660
explanation as to why um and then brainstorming
uh potential compromises on new Solutions this is
0:09:51.660,0:09:57.420
where consensus comes in okay so the whole point
of this now that I've I've set the stage even more
0:09:58.380,0:10:02.040
um the point of consensus is that
it is an alternative to democracy
0:10:04.080,0:10:09.600
um on the grandest scale it's an alternative to
democracy and with democracy you have up and down
0:10:09.600,0:10:14.040
voting right you might have simple majority
where you just need greater than 50 of the
0:10:14.040,0:10:16.980
votes you might have a super majority
which could be two-thirds of the votes
0:10:18.120,0:10:23.640
um you then you can have all kinds of
other little you know things like uh uh
0:10:23.640,0:10:29.280
um not a block uh what do you call it the the
filibuster um basically a block where someone
0:10:29.280,0:10:34.320
you know a small group a minority a minority group
says we're so opposed to this we're going to stall
0:10:34.320,0:10:41.760
everything just to prevent it from happening
and by the way blocks exist in consensus too now
0:10:42.480,0:10:47.880
the thing about consensus though is
that it's not it's not a vote as like
0:10:47.880,0:10:52.500
okay someone proposed this issue now we're
going to vote on it and move on no consensus
0:10:52.500,0:10:57.180
takes a lot longer because it requires lots of
negotiation because it includes everyone's voice
0:10:58.200,0:11:02.100
and well how do you include everyone's voice
because you can never come up with a solution
0:11:02.100,0:11:09.360
that satisfies everyone well the point is is
that you have to be very creative with consensus
0:11:10.380,0:11:15.720
um and and you might come up with
something that is not necessarily
0:11:17.580,0:11:23.340
how am I trying to say this like let's let's take
the issue of abortion for instance the initial
0:11:23.340,0:11:30.000
question the initial proposal might be hey let's
ban abortion after 12 weeks and then you get you
0:11:30.000,0:11:35.040
know uh the progressives and the conservatives
arguing you get men and women arguing you get
0:11:35.880,0:11:40.320
um you know socially traditional people
and socially moderate uh moderate modern
0:11:40.320,0:11:47.280
people all arguing and you have you know 90
million different perspectives on abortion
0:11:48.480,0:11:55.320
and people bring up different different issues
right different uh points of concern so one
