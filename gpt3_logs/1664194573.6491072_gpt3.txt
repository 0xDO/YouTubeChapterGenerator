TRANSCRIPT: and and we can expand the story for each of these like break this down into uh yeah okay i mean this these premises are so good um yeah okay okay i think i think we can work with this i think we can work with this also this is probably done um let's go ahead and get this started uh raj and priya a painter falls in love with a girl excellent excellent excellent and that should have us up to was that 45 total so we need just a couple more romance let's go ahead and set this to run um all right imaginary audience in my head what kind of romance should we do oh paranormal romance done paranormal romance story uh and then we will go from 45 to 51 so that'll take us all the way up to 50. 50 on the dot cls python generate some premises luke is actually a werewolf that's fun this is great i love this um okay this will only take a minute because we're almost done already 47. jenna is looking jenna looks forward to the weekend a lot in gpthree's brain um [Laughter] this is funny when you wake up from your car accident you find oh this is a first person story excellent excellent excellent um honestly these premises are so good like i don't know if i need to break them down in any further um but let's see let me go back to this guy's comment because maybe maybe this is more of an extraction thing um he said you know setup inciting incident midpoint false high all hope is lost and climax okay actually you know what dude john david parsons i'm just going to copy this because this is such a powerful way to start um let me just paste this in here um identify the following elements all right just copy that for now let's go back over here roman oh wait nope brainstorm a detailed plot synopsis for random all right so now we're going to switch to uh let's see 75 actually no we'll say 76. um now we're going to switch to what did i say sci-fi all right sci-fi and we'll say um science fiction story and then we'll switch that over from like science fiction to like um actually no let's say random hard science fiction and then we'll do like um epic or space opera yeah we'll do space opera next okay so let's get this running uh n a that's interesting did it really just like spit out n a it did okay gbt3 said no i'm not going to give you a premise okay whatever um we'll just delete that one and see what it's doing in the future the human race has all but wiped out a race of advanced aliens wow we're we're jackasses um okay so we're getting some stories okay identify the following elements for the premise one setup why does it keep jumping all the way down two inciting incident three midpoint four false high five all hope is lost six climax and i will actually probably go copy kmylen's storybeat because kmyland is pretty good okay so one um setup all right let's see if it can identify let's turn the temperature down because we don't want it to be as creative now we do want it we do want it to be somewhat creative but we don't want it to go off the rails okay this looks like it's working leaving samir behind i don't know that that actually worked let's see let's see what happens if we turn the temperature down even more and i'll try turning it back up in just a second okay so again this is just kind of like regurgitating the same um there's not really any value add that's that's why i'm not so happy with this is because these premises are so great so it's like okay well what what do we do from here um i guess i guess i will i will go back and say like okay it can it can be helpful if we have a um have a good like breakdown um but let's see cam while in plot beats uh what are her here we go the first act the hook first plot point inciting incident evident key event first half of the second act midpoint this is not the list that i was thinking of because it doesn't include the pinch points oh well this is good enough um setup and citing incident midpoint falls high all hope is lost dark knight is soul whatever climax that's fine we'll go with this all right so temperature of 0.5 let's see if it's consistent okay so this does break it down into a few points um we'll go with that for now uh i really think that we should expand on this though actually here let's let's be more creative uh okay write a detailed opening scene for a film with the following premise um use let's see what is the standard screenplay format called okay um use standard script formats for hollywood films screenplay let's see what it does with this fade in oh wow this is it this is fascinating screenplay fades in exterior of naina's village day we see a small village in the middle of nowhere there are simple houses and dirt roads we see a young woman naina walking down the road she's carrying a small bag and looks determined nina to herself this is it i'm going to the city and i'm going to make something of myself wow this is phenomenal oh man okay nina jumps out of the way and falls to the ground in anger what the hell the car stops and young man sameer gets out he looks apologetic i'm so sorry are you okay i'm fine just watch where you're going next time samir nods okay i'm i will i'm really sorry waves him off it's fine just be more careful um i think it ended because ran out of tokens uh okay i really like this so instead of instead of instead of because the premise is complete we don't need we don't need to break that down it's got this is a full story um so let's copy this and say we'll save this as prompt screenplay or we'll just call it a script um okay and then if i'm not mistaken this is probably done yay the year is 20 27 55 the human race has been decimated by a pandemic it swept across the globe too relevant the year is 20xx okay um all right cool so we should have up to number 75 we got a whole bunch of sci-fi premises so let's go back here we'll start at 76 and go to 101 and we're going to change the prompt script what did i say or the premise this is going to be a um space opera science fiction story okay so let's kick this off again
