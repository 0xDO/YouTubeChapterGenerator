The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: operations because um as gpt3 is reading the input because it reads it one character or rather one token at a time so if we start with the ideas first it's going to be like oh let's write this and then it sees what it wrote last time it'll say wait there's some stuff missing from this because we want in terms of the internal representation we want this stuff to be more important okay so let's see if that works oh good so you see okay it's integrating these ideas first okay maybe it was just a matter of order of operations um let's see uh i'm not i'm like okay and it integrated this so putting the ideas first helped but it only added a couple of things right it just kind of changed a little bit of the tone of the first thing um finally nine yeah okay let's say next passage um write another passage to follow the first use the following ideas to expand and elaborate let's just say okay so ideas whoops did i delete it okay first passage so this rather that rather than framing it as like a rewrite job um we'll use kind of the inchworm method that i use for my novel generation where it's like okay this is what you've got now add more okay let's see if this works oh good okay here we go good good good good um so it continued it but let's see how much it mentioned the individual okay it mentioned the individual once in the subsequent one something larger than oneself okay it did integrate those ideas it just added one one sentence at a time okay this is good enough i'm still not quite happy with it but yeah what can you do um all right so let's go back to our prompt so we'll do the ideas first because that seems to help performance and then we'll do first passage and then we'll just do next passage okay so this should work so now we've got the brainstorm and the expand we'll see um it looks like it's going to be pretty slow in terms of adding stuff but now let's update our script because we're going to need the chunk um yeah we're going to need the chunk and so then the expansion equals gpd3 and this is a really simple script all it does is open the brainstorm prompt get the ideas so you get the ideas and then open the expand prompt and get the expansion and so then what we'll do is the result append will be chunk plus space plus expansion because each chunk should end in a period um so like and then the expansion will will add to it okay all right i think this is this is good um i started so the one i was testing with earlier was it just said eat bug so we'll start with that one again because it was pretty funny um it ended up concluding that like bugs were a great source of food and it was fit for kings and queens and all sorts of fun stuff okay so now that we've done some prompt engineering we'll start with the input of eat bug and we'll delete this all right so now you can see the whole process we'll close the original prompt because we're not using that anymore and then we will go and how long is this video it's already 20 minutes yeah i thought that this was just going to be a quick like hey guys look what i did but no it's never that easy is it um okay so we got the the thing here input output uh python increasingly verbose and i probably messed something up but let's see what happens thinking thinking okay so the input was eat bug the output is eat bug catching the bug is easy simply put some food out and wait for it to come to you once you have your bug you need to cook it this can be done in a number of ways but some people prefer to simply fry their bugs in a hot pan okay so clearly it added to it it's good the formatting looks right um let me show you so i record every interaction with gpt3 um so let me show you what that looks like so the second to last one eat bug divergent ideas to expand responses cook the bug catch the bug grow the bug sell the bug eat bugs and it's gross bugs are yummy bugs are nutritious bugs are a delicacy okay so let's see if it succeeded in integrating that okay talked about cooking it eating bugs is gross to some people but others find them yummy bugs are also quite nutritious okay so it integrated all of those ideas um why not give bugs a try i think the only thing it didn't do is sell them oh no you can't sell yeah okay so it integrated every idea and added that as a passage so now let's do this recursively let's take that output set it as the new input and let's run it again let's see if we can write a whole book about eating bugs increasingly verbose to the wind for the win to the rescue into the shadow realm all the means um hmm it looks like it just started repeating itself again let's see because this was the new section maybe what i'll do is i'll add like a new line after it yeah so you can put some food out and it just repeated itself damn you all right let's see what ideas it came up with and see why that didn't work so that should be this one different ways to catch a bug how to store bugs once you've caught them other methods of cooking bugs what kind of bugs are best to eat how to start your own bug eating business so those are good ideas why didn't it why didn't you use them so we'll go back here go to the very end yeah because look here here's the ideas hmm i am disappointed i might have to pause this because this is not this is not going as well as i thought it would be going that's very sad um okay how long is this video so far 22 minutes let's give it a little bit longer y'all are usually okay with 20 30 to 40 minute long videos let's see if we can overcome this problem okay so the expand um write another passage to follow the first use the following ideas to expand and elaborate um let's see let's say explore and elaborate on the ideas um listed below next passage based on above ideas okay let's see if that works um actually here let's no let's just delete that one because that was getting really repetitive okay so let's try this again increasingly verbose.pie for the win let's go oh there we go that looks good output okay why not give

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

As GPT3 reads the input, it reads it one token at a time. This means that if we start with the ideas first, it will be able to integrate them more easily. Let's see if that works.

Indeed, starting with the ideas first helped, but only added a couple of things. It just changed the tone of the first thing slightly.

Finally, let's try the next passage. Write another passage to follow the first, using the following ideas to expand and elaborate.

The subsequent passage mentioned the individual once, something larger than oneself. It did integrate those ideas, but only added one sentence at a time.

Overall, this is a good enough result. But I'm still not quite happy with it.
