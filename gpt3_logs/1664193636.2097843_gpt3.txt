The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: but he is he remains just a philosopher so if you want a hardcore materialist view of what consciousness is i recommend phantoms in the brain and by vs ramachandran so anyways materialism and empiricism are kind of a result of throwing out the idea of souls and spirits and religion and anything immaterial so because where we are today is that we have we have decided that um we're just going to throw all that out and we're going to say no there is no such thing as anything immaterial so we are going to focus on the material the real and the and energy and matter and that is that is empiricism that is where we are today with science however um well actually before we move on i will say that people like ramachandran who is a neuroscientist he does a really good job of showing how consciousness and sentience are modified and dependent on the operation of the brain so that seems to indicate that maybe materialism is correct if the brain goes offline you go offline if you have a lesion on the brain that prevents you from interpreting um reading you could look at these symbols and say like okay that's just squiggles on a on a book but i can't recognize and there's actually conditions where you can't even recognize objects where you just say that's a thing i don't know what it is but it's a thing so if your brain can break and you become less conscious or less sentient and or less sapient and able to process the world that lends credence to the idea that perhaps that our brains are purely materialistic in that um everything about our consciousness emerges from uh from uh physical systems and energy so this friend that i um that i talked to he said okay you know if we if we go if we start with you know chalmers and materialism and we say consciousness is just a matter of calculation anything that does the does the correct calculations and we're talking from a quantum perspective right quantum information is being processed um you know this book is quantum information it's going through interactions it's quantum information is being processed and so that gives rise to the idea of pan psychism which is like okay the human brain is just matter and energy it's doing quantum calculations therefore um if there's nothing else special about us then consciousness can emerge from anything that does the correct calculations and perhaps everything is conscious pan psychism it's just maybe its experience of being is very different from ours so that's pansysm and and i was not convinced but having a conversation with my friend um he said like yeah like what's different from you know a human brain or a tree right um and and this is this is why i'm making in other videos because there's a lot of comments um and people have talked about this kind of stuff and i was like you know maybe i was a little dismissive at first but then after this conversation with a friend it really started uh kind of fermenting um okay so if we are anchored in materialism and empiricism and we say consciousness is just a matter of doing the right calculations okay then sure with the right set of apis and large language models then then a machine could be fully conscious could be fully sentient however we get to where did it go we get to quantum physics and sorry i got a stack of books okay philosophy of physics quantum theory um the prince and foundations of contemporary philosophy this book looks at i think it's seven different um quantum mechanics experiments over the last uh 80 plus years um and then when you look at quote quotations from people like niels bohr and other um other you know the grandfathers of quantum mechanics they all came to the conclusion that human consciousness is uh is critical to the existence of the universe so then we end up with some stuff like the anthropic principle a strong anthropic principle as proposed by barrow and tipler state that the universe in some sense is compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life will emerge within it um so basically like something about the universe seems that like we inevitably must exist um but anyways point being is that a lot of quantum physicists have come to the conclusion that consciousness is absolutely critical for the existence of the universe and so that gives rise to things like the measurement problem so the measurement problem is if you um if if you don't have something that met that makes a measurement and then that measurement doesn't end up in a human mind does the does the uh wave function collapse and that's a gross oversimplification anyways point being there are things like delayed choice experiments in quantum physics which basically shows that um the universe time does not does not move linearly to the universe the universe will sort of reverse engineer what must have been what must needed to have been true in the past in order to make the the present situation correct or interpretable um and so uh then there's also the concept of non-locality um so like quantum non-locality uh is rising and it's right it's in the ascendancy um where the real world does not seem to be anchored to what is physically you know distance or physical distance doesn't seem to matter as much and so the image that is emerging is that materialism or realism is not accurate materialism and realism explain much of what we see but it can't explain everything okay so we've set the stage for materialism for realism um for empiricism and then uh you know we've also talked about the the philosophical state that we're in which is post-modernism and nihilism near-death experiences so there's a book life after life this actually codified near-death experiences but research is ongoing i strongly recommend you watch these videos from university of california riverside um i devoured this book and then watched a bunch of videos so and read you don't have to take my word for it you know read the books watch the videos phenomenon of near-death experiences defeat in my mind

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Philosophers and scientists have long debated the nature of consciousness. Is it a product of the physical world, as materialists believe? Or is it something more, as panpsychists suggest?

Recent research into near-death experiences (NDEs) has provided evidence that consciousness may indeed transcend the physical world. NDEs are well-documented cases of people who have died and then been revived, often with memories of an afterlife.

This research challenges the materialist view of consciousness and suggests that there may be more to our experience of the world than what can be explained by the physical world alone. It also raises the possibility that the universe itself is consciousness, as some quantum physicists have suggested.
