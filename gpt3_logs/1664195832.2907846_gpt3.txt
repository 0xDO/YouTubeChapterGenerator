TRANSCRIPT: that information this powershell script will save every prime number from 1 to let's not go too crazy to a thousand um in a csv file okay and so then we'll just do let's just let it go and see what happens hey look at that okay um all right so says this powershell script will save every prime number from one to a thousand in a csv file so it starts with um dollar primes equals um splat and then uh whoops and then parentheses so that's oh darn it what did i do i hit ctrl z too many times can i bring it back please come back okay now let me run it again i'll run this again and i'll copy it out to a different interpreter to a different thing um okay we don't need the instructions how to use although it is nice that it's giving it to us um so let's save this here we'll do language p powershell okay so let's take a look at this so primes it so this this instantiates a list and then we do four so this is a conventional for loop so for i equals two and for while i is less than or equal to a thousand we increment i plus one so that's how you declare a for loop in in good old c or c plus plus it's fascinating that powershell just kind of copied that syntax exactly so then you say is prime equals true and then what you do is so this is fascinating so the logic that it used is it gives us another iterable so it says 2 and then so while j so j starts at 2 while j is less than i so this is our number i we're going to increment j so basically every number up until our um the one that we're we're counting um is is that and then so we use the modulo which is the so you have dividend and remainder so if you divide them and there's a remainder of zero which means it divided in in evenly then you say it's not it's not prime and you break right so then you exit the loop and so then if it is still prime then you add it to the list and then um it exports export csv to path whatever i didn't specify i just said okay drop it on my desktop this won't work because my username is not user um and then it adds no type information i love that type information makes csv kind of like wonky all right so let's let's do a quick thing let's do ise that's not what i wanted ise there we go powershell ise so ise is uh is the integrated interpreter for powershell let's see view script pane right let's close commands now i do want to clean this up a little bit because like um let me show you there's a couple things wrong with it so i don't want this i don't need those i don't need those instructions um and i also don't want to do it i'll just do right host no not debug darn it right host oh can i zoom in there we go okay so then we run this oh wow that was really fast so then 2 3 5 7 11 13 so far so good i don't know the prime numbers off the top of my head but it looks like it got them so there you have it um let me do a time check oh yeah we're 11 minutes perfect okay so you've got you've got your feet wet with um with uh with codex um i've shown you a couple things just right off the bat so you get an intuition of how to get started it often does barf out more stuff than you need um and so it's just a matter of you get the function that you want you clean it up and then you're good to go all right well thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon if you like what i do if i get enough supporters i could probably do this full time who knows

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

This powershell script will save every prime number from 1 to 1,000 in a csv file.

The script uses a conventional for loop to iterate through each number from 2 to 1,000. For each number, the script checks if it is prime by iterating through every number from 2 to that number and checking if there is a remainder when dividing them. If there is no remainder, the number is not prime and the script breaks. Otherwise, the number is added to a list of prime numbers.

The script then exports the list of prime numbers to a csv file on the desktop.

The script runs quickly and efficiently, and produces a list of all the prime numbers from 1 to 1,000.
