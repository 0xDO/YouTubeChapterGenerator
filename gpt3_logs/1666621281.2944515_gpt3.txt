0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:13:50.100,0:13:55.740
you for helping get us oriented as to what are
the problems that Tao is trying to solve um but
0:13:55.740,0:14:03.360
let's take a step to the side just for a second
because um what I want to do is is just spend a
0:14:03.360,0:14:08.040
few minutes um informing the audience for anyone
who doesn't know what a Dao is a decentralized
0:14:08.040,0:14:12.540
autonomous organization and how that relates
to other existing Technologies like blockchain
0:14:12.540,0:14:16.800
Ohad would you like to kind of introduce
the concept of the Dow and the blockchain
0:14:18.900,0:14:31.680
I am though isn't it something that um intended
to to be an organization that is controlled
0:14:31.680,0:14:40.200
by the users that is decentralized and and
typically they do so by um very basic means
0:14:40.200,0:14:47.760
so remember that I asked before how can a large
group of people can reach agreement well voting
0:14:47.760,0:14:51.900
that's the method that comes to mind and
that's what existing doubts basically do
0:14:52.680,0:14:58.980
and but maybe to take a step ahead there
is one fundamental problem with voting
0:15:00.240,0:15:07.440
the problem is that even though everyone
have equal I to vote it is still not the
0:15:07.440,0:15:12.960
case that everyone have effectively
equalized to propose what to vote over
0:15:14.160,0:15:21.060
because even if you have the right to propose who
is going to even read a million proposals a day
0:15:23.220,0:15:27.480
so even if everyone have right to
proposities by no means effective
0:15:28.560,0:15:36.000
so what people do is create hierarchies that
in particular determine what to vote over
0:15:36.600,0:15:39.900
but then you get huge loss of information it
0:15:40.440,0:15:45.900
your opinion no matter how good it is or correct
it is will most likely not be incorporated
0:15:48.360,0:15:55.260
and these fundamental real life problem is
also reflected in the Taos as we know them
0:16:01.680,0:16:08.340
the the one of the chief well so there's there's a
few problems that you elucidated here so one is is
0:16:09.180,0:16:14.400
at present one of the one of the ways that
everyone is familiar with in terms of making group
0:16:14.400,0:16:19.740
decisions larger decisions is voting but there are
some problems with voting and we'll get into that
0:16:20.400,0:16:25.980
um but then also as you said even just integrating
everyone's feedback that's a huge problem and that
0:16:25.980,0:16:31.380
goes to to the problem of anytime you have more
than 10 people in a room you can't hear everyone
0:16:31.380,0:16:37.020
you can't get everyone's opinion but then if you
get to the scale of thousands millions whatever
0:16:38.160,0:16:43.860
um you have to as you say create you have to
delegate or create hierarchies and and one of your
0:16:43.860,0:16:49.020
points is that Dows have not have not fully solved
this problem yet so this is this is something that
0:16:49.020,0:16:54.540
differentiates the Tau network from an ordinary
decentralized autonomous organization correct
0:16:56.700,0:17:05.220
and yes yes very much so so you can you can look
at it as using the economical term of diminishing
0:17:05.220,0:17:14.640
returns so in economy um diminishing returns means
uh like a typical example is that each a new team
0:17:14.640,0:17:20.520
member in a company contributes less than the
next one so if you have 10 people and you add
0:17:20.520,0:17:26.280
another one it's not going to be 10 tradition
it's going to be less similarly in discussions
0:17:28.020,0:17:32.400
um if you double the number of participants
you are not going to get double
0:17:33.120,0:17:39.600
the outcome and at some point you are
even going to get Negative outcome
0:17:41.820,0:17:46.740
and indeed our solution solves this
problem completely in the sense that
0:17:46.740,0:17:53.100
if you will have 100 times more people you
will have 100 times more utility at least
0:17:55.320,0:17:59.940
that is a big claim but uh I believe it and
hopefully by the end of the episode our users
0:17:59.940,0:18:06.600
or our viewers will believe it too um Professor
franconi um previously we talked about some of
0:18:06.600,0:18:12.240
the some of the specific problems uh conceptual
problems with this in terms of and also Ohad
0:18:12.960,0:18:17.580
um either of you feel free to jump in but the
limitations of language of English language
0:18:17.580,0:18:23.460
or German French you know any naturally can
conceived language there are limitations that
