0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:03.360,0:00:09.420
morning everybody David Shapiro here with another
video so a couple couple days ago or last week
0:00:09.420,0:00:17.160
whenever I did a quick uh cover letter chatbot
generator um it was pretty popular um but I saw on
0:00:17.160,0:00:22.740
um the gpd3 subreddit someone was asking for more
help with cover letters and resumes so I figured
0:00:22.740,0:00:29.220
let's make this into a bigger project so the
most annoying part about filling out resumes is
0:00:29.220,0:00:36.240
entering your information repeatedly so what I was
I was uh gonna rather than create a chat bot that
0:00:36.240,0:00:41.040
asks you the same questions every time I figured
let's just go ahead and pre-load a bunch of these
0:00:41.040,0:00:44.400
questions so like what is your name the company
you're applying for so there's just a couple of
0:00:44.400,0:00:49.200
variables to update each time how many years of
experience do you have what are your professional
0:00:49.200,0:00:54.960
strengths but a lot of this won't change right
um let's see so then we'll add questions like
0:00:56.100,0:01:05.820
um why are you excited about this particular
job role um that's probably about it
0:01:06.900,0:01:17.640
um let's see what about the job stands out to you
why are you a great fit um okay so that's probably
0:01:17.640,0:01:23.460
good enough so what I'm doing here is I'm just
saving some of these answers in a Json file and
0:01:23.460,0:01:28.200
so I'll fill it out for myself David Shapiro you
all know me what is the job you're applying for
0:01:29.460,0:01:38.880
um senior cognitive architect um what is the
role you're oh wait no that's the derp uh
0:01:38.880,0:01:46.020
we'll we'll call it uh um Acme robot Sciences
um okay a senior cognitive architect how many
0:01:46.020,0:01:51.240
years of experience do you have uh total I got
like you know we'll say 16 years of experience
0:01:52.320,0:01:57.480
um let's see what are your greatest
professional strengths um I think extremely fast
0:01:59.040,0:02:06.120
um what are your professional growth desires
I want to create a new field of research
0:02:06.840,0:02:16.380
artificial cognition what kind of environment
do you prefer um very relaxed uh Pace but
0:02:17.400,0:02:23.040
technically challenging what does
your ideal work day look like
0:02:23.940,0:02:32.820
um flexible hours I tend to work
very early um in the morning
0:02:35.100,0:02:40.680
let's see why are you excited about
this particular job role this is my
0:02:42.120,0:02:55.380
absolute top passion I want to uh let's see create
robots and machines that will um replace all human
0:02:55.380,0:03:03.780
labor so we can live a life of luxury basically I
just want to be on vacation all the time we want
0:03:03.780,0:03:09.180
to go to so my fiance and I we want to go like

Greek Islands so that's that's the future that
I want let's see what about the job stands out
0:03:13.740,0:03:22.080
to you why are you a great fit I am a great fit
because I have already written a few books about
0:03:22.920,0:03:29.640
artificial cognition Okay so we've got some
we we just got some off the cuff things here
0:03:30.660,0:03:37.500
um so let's see so we'll take this we'll start
here and this is just like boilerplate stuff so
0:03:37.500,0:03:43.920
open file save file load info um so myinfo.json
if you want to use this just update this
