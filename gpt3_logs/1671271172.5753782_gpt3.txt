0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:16:08.580,0:16:17.160
um I am extremely old right um and by generating
these uh there's like so each each one of these
0:16:17.160,0:16:21.540
um has like six possible things because there's
mildly moderately and extremely and then there's
0:16:21.540,0:16:26.340
the positive and negative side so you know I'm
extremely selfish or I'm extremely generous so you
0:16:26.340,0:16:33.180
got six uh for each of these and I think there's
28 dimensions of Personality or 30 or something so
0:16:33.180,0:16:38.880
you multiply that out and there's a whole bunch of
of combinations on top of the basic demographics
0:16:38.880,0:16:45.660
like education gender genetic population so
rather than saying race race or ethnicity I
0:16:45.660,0:16:51.000
just like what is what is your genetic background
um because you know race and ethnicity it's like
0:16:52.380,0:16:57.000
from a social perspective it matters you
know from the shape of your nose and the
0:16:57.000,0:17:01.080
color of your skin and stuff um you know
like you look at me I'm bald I got a big
0:17:01.080,0:17:05.340
nose like and my last name Shapiro you
know what genetic population I come from
0:17:06.480,0:17:11.160
um and then you know occupation religion
sexuality so these are these are some basic
0:17:11.160,0:17:17.280
demographics you pick and choose from those
but then the personality right okay so then
0:17:18.180,0:17:23.940
um here is here is the long detailed essay about
myself and my life story so this is creating
0:17:23.940,0:17:33.900
a judgment-free Persona which gpt3 seems like
it's okay it's it's it's um pretty good at um so
0:17:33.900,0:17:40.920
stubborn extremely critical moderately spiritual
okay so I was born in a small town in sub-Saharan
0:17:40.920,0:17:45.540
Africa my parents were both production workers and
we lived in a modest home I had a choppy heiled
0:17:45.540,0:17:50.220
happy childhood despite the fact that my parents
were often working long hours I was curious and
0:17:50.220,0:17:55.680
loved to explore my surroundings I'm also very
spiritual my family would go to the local temple
0:17:56.580,0:18:02.100
As I Grew Older I became more critical because
remember the extremely critical I began to see
0:18:02.100,0:18:06.360
the inequalities that existed between different
groups of people as it became very stubborn and
0:18:06.360,0:18:09.900
often refused to do things they didn't agree with
however I was also very thoughtful and would spend
0:18:09.900,0:18:15.060
time considering different points of view um as
I entered more entered adulthood I became more
0:18:15.060,0:18:19.560
interested in politics I began to see the world in
terms of political systems and ideologies I also
0:18:19.560,0:18:24.840
became more Progressive in My Views and began
to support equality for all people so this is
0:18:26.640,0:18:31.620
well I probably need to fix this because
it says extremely authoritarian and then
0:18:31.620,0:18:39.600
moderately Progressive um so those are kind of at
odds with each other and again the model is kind
0:18:39.600,0:18:44.580
of aligned to be more Progressive in general
and so it's ignoring the authoritarianism and
0:18:44.580,0:18:50.220
just saying I'm Progressive um so we'll fix that
however also became more apolitical and began to
0:18:50.220,0:18:56.340
distance myself from the political system
um so yeah I've got a bunch of uh politics
0:18:56.340,0:19:02.880
things here so like like has authoritarian
views but is Progressive in apolitical
0:19:04.080,0:19:11.460
um mildly egalitarian mildly racist you know
simple things um and this is also a first
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.580
first pass um but so this one this person became
apolitical okay today I'm a genderqueer female
0:19:17.580,0:19:22.980
who is bisexual I'm also Sikh and my family still
practices this religion I'm currently working in
0:19:22.980,0:19:28.140
production and I am also pursuing a post-secondary
education I'm old but I'm still very curious and
0:19:28.140,0:19:32.160
interested in learning new things I'm also very
collectivist I believe that we're all connected
0:19:32.160,0:19:37.860
and should um work together to make the world a
better place okay cool so moderately collectivist
0:19:37.860,0:19:42.000
moderately competitive and if you run this a few
times you'll get a different life story every time
0:19:43.080,0:19:49.740
um okay so with that being said um I've
got this let me zoom in a little bit
0:19:52.440,0:20:04.620
um actually properties 28. there we go okay
so then uh python generate personas so I've
0:20:04.620,0:20:10.260
got a quick little script that will just barf
out a bunch of these personas and so you can
