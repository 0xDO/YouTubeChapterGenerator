0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:01.020,0:00:09.540
hey everybody David Shapiro here we have a very
very special podcast today for our decentralized
0:00:09.540,0:00:17.520
future in this podcast episode I interview
professor franconi and Ohad asor uh from Tao
0:00:17.520,0:00:25.260
now tau is a company it is a startup well it's
been around since 2015 and they are working on
0:00:25.260,0:00:30.420
decentralized artificial intelligence but it's a
kind of artificial intelligence that you might not
0:00:30.420,0:00:38.880
be familiar with it is incredibly disruptive and
uh it's pretty it's pretty complex and that's why
0:00:38.880,0:00:46.140
this episode is so long but just to give you kind
of a preview as to what this technology does is
0:00:46.140,0:00:54.600
that it decentralizes the development of software
now that might sound very simple and conceptually
0:00:54.600,0:00:59.400
it is simple there's a lot of problems that go
into that but the other thing that it does is
0:00:59.400,0:01:07.440
it creates a store for all human knowledge as
it develops software and solves problems and so
0:01:07.440,0:01:12.960
because of that the network gets more intelligent
over time and gains new capabilities over time
0:01:13.680,0:01:21.360
and that has a just absolutely profound astounding
implications which we get to by the end of
0:01:21.360,0:01:26.520
the episode so I just wanted to give a brief
introduction and then and then we can go ahead
0:01:26.520,0:01:32.760
and dive into the episode so I hope you enjoy this
interview with professor franconi and Ohad of Tau
0:01:35.700,0:01:42.240
thanks everyone for joining this episode of
our decentralized future uh today's episode
0:01:42.240,0:01:47.340
is really exciting we've been looking forward
to it for quite a while um I've got with me
0:01:47.340,0:01:55.920
Professor Enrico franconi and Ohad osor um from
Tau now these folks have been working on the Tau
0:01:55.920,0:02:04.140
Network for since uh 2015 I believe and uh this
is an incredible technology it took me a little
0:02:04.140,0:02:10.560
while to understand it and once I did I realized
this is the way of the future and so when they
0:02:10.560,0:02:14.940
reached out to me and asked me to uh to host
this episode I said yes absolutely let's do it
0:02:15.960,0:02:21.300
um so without further Ado I'd like to introduce my
guest today so first we have um Professor Enrico
0:02:21.300,0:02:32.640
francone who is uh welcome um who has been
uh like myself a uh lifelong Problem Solver
0:02:33.300,0:02:38.160
um and our in our introductory discussion he
told me all about how he just loves solving
0:02:38.160,0:02:42.960
tough problems and here we are working
on very difficult ones so uh Professor
0:02:42.960,0:02:48.000
would you like to give us a couple words about
yourself to introduce yourself okay thank you
0:02:48.720,0:02:54.360
um well I am a professor in computer science
in general but most specifically in Ai and
0:02:54.360,0:03:01.740
another representation since more than 30
years now and what I like to do and what I
0:03:01.740,0:03:08.640
believe is the right thing to do in in the
field of AI is to provide technologies that
0:03:09.720,0:03:18.600
um make sure that whatever system you build based
on AI can be trusted so and we know that the the
0:03:18.600,0:03:27.240
science of trust since 2000 years is logic and
so basically this is leading to a scientific
0:03:27.240,0:03:32.820
field research field which is called computational
logic and the computational logic applied it to AI
0:03:32.820,0:03:39.900
brings to what is called now logical AI which is
what I'm doing and and I found in Tau a group of
0:03:39.900,0:03:46.260
people there is a smart group of people that have
the same ideas made the same goals as my research
0:03:46.260,0:03:52.500
goals they of course want to make a real world
system and while I'm just a professor from the
0:03:52.500,0:03:57.120
University doing research so I think that joining
these efforts is something very interesting
0:03:58.740,0:04:02.580
excellent thank you so much for the
introduction and for being here today
0:04:05.580,0:04:23.700
in early 2015 after someone from from the internet
and they told me someone Anonymous told me about
0:04:23.700,0:04:32.220
an idea and how about the necessity and the idea
for a blockchain to be controlled by its users and
0:04:32.220,0:04:39.120
he came up with some initial design but it changed
a lot since then and that's how it all started
0:04:39.960,0:04:46.860
excellent yeah so speaking of blockchain um that
will be a that is one of the major Technologies uh
0:04:46.860,0:04:52.260
underpinning the Tau Network um but before we
get into some of the technical details in the
