The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: and different so that will prime it to say okay we're gonna be divergent um and actually let's add divergent ideas to expand because like okay if it's just gonna give me three things and the temperature is already at one like that's not good enough that's not good enough there we go um okay examples of how nihilism has led to harmful consequences in individuals or society yes we got it because that is a great topic of conversation to expand upon ways in which avoiding nihilism can benefit both the individual and society also good all right perfect so i like this new prompt so let's go back to our brainstorm prompt and we'll um clean that up so we'll do passage so this is the token that i used to just do the find and replace deferrgent ideas to expand all right so then we'll do that got it okay so then we just feed all this back in so let's go ahead and grab well first let's take the expansion passage so it says lengthen the following passage use the following ideas to expand and elaborate on the passage on the following passage i have followings too many times okay so we give the passage and then ideas and then expanded version so i'm not sure if ideas or passage should be first we can play with that when i when i tested this um a minute ago it was it seemed like it was just fine like it kind of doesn't matter um which which order you use which order of operations okay so let's grab our passage which is this one all right so we've got our three paragraphs and then let's grab our ideas um wait did i save them oh crap go here we go okay need the ideas let's copy these out and so basically i can just take the contents of both of these so it's like take the output of this one um the input and output of this prompt and then put them together in a new prompt so that's called prompt chaining in case you haven't heard that before um okay so then we take this let's go to our expand passage or expand prompt sorry all right and then we grab the passage and we populate it here and then we go to the ideas get it here and um so one thing that i found is that when you turn the temperature up especially for when you're asking it to be creative you get much better results and then the maximum length of 2500 tokens let's oh oh yeah see it's warning me okay that's too far okay so let's just say 3 000 tokens okay expanded version let's see nihilism is bad for several reasons this will take a minute to finish so let's um i'm going to drink some tea wallets or coffee rather away it goes and what we'll do is we'll compare um oh no it looks like it didn't expand on it interesting um okay so let's uh let's see let's see how long that was okay so this is 1992 characters the expanded version and the previous version is drumroll please 1697. okay so it did add it it made it a little bit longer but you know it's only a couple like sentences here and there all right so we got to do a little bit more prompt engineering um let's see because i'm saying lengthen the following passage so like just the goal make it longer so it knows up front use the ideas um use the ideas to expand and elaborate on the passage uh let's see ideas um what happens if we do re like rewritten and expanded version oh someone asked i don't remember where it was on reddit or the community or youtube comment they asked why i tend to do all caps and the reason is because lower case or normal case words are one token in gpt3 and caps versions are another token and so by by it means the same thing to us semantically but to gpt3 it signals oh this is like a title block or something um and so because it's a different set of tokens like expanded versus expanded those are different tokens inside of gpt3 so it looks different to the machine so there is a very specific reason that i do that and because normal pros is going to be normal case but like instructions or demarcations those are caps case because it's going to look different to the machine okay so let's do rewritten and expanded version um let's see uh let's see uh let's see expanded version with um elucidation so the more oops the more fancy words you use the more you kind of activate different circuits within gpt3's brain so like lengthen elucidate expand elaborate um and we already used expand so let's use expounded version oops not don't save this is not the text document okay let's see how that goes okay still didn't add too much let's see how long this is compared to the previous output okay so this 1992 it's actually shorter okay well it did add a little bit um i wonder if we should just say like instead of rewriting it we should just say like add these new topics um ideas uh let's see uh um okay so we got the idea so we're saying length in it so rather than rewrite it we don't want it to rewrite let's let's what if we just say like add to it um let's see not length in the following passage let's say continue continue the following passage use the ideas use the following ideas to elaborate to expand and elaborate on the passage okay continued passage with new ideas that might be what we're looking for so rather than rewriting it because there's no i guess yeah in order for it to be more efficient this makes more sense anyways i don't know why i was thinking just rewrite the whole thing maybe because i was stuck in the idea of summarizing where it's like okay you take thing a and make it into thing b that's nearly identical but when you're adding something when it's generative it looks like it's still just rewriting it hmm okay so that maybe it's not me maybe it's this fine tune model let's try an older instruct model so davinci instruct beta maximum length that's fine we'll take that lower to 1500 that should be good it's just rewriting it and now it's copying itself this is kind of frustrating this is way harder than i thought it was going to be okay all right so let's move the ideas above the original passage so that it has the ideas first oh maybe that's what it is maybe it's an order of

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Nihilism is harmful to individuals and society for several reasons. Individuals who subscribe to nihilistic beliefs may be more likely to engage in self-destructive behaviors, such as substance abuse or risky behaviors. Nihilism can also lead to a sense of hopelessness, which can lead people to give up on their goals and dreams.

Avoiding nihilism can benefit both the individual and society. Individuals who avoid nihilistic beliefs are more likely to have a sense of hope and purpose. They are also more likely to be successful in achieving their goals. Society as a whole can benefit from avoiding nihilism by having a more positive and productive outlook.
