how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:10:49.040,0:10:54.480
you can use the edit endpoint to further
augment your training data so this is great um
0:10:56.560,0:11:00.880
let's see delighted in the stories acetics
0:11:03.360,0:11:10.480
transmutation i think it actually did
like an entirely different story okay um
0:11:12.640,0:11:18.000
i don't know that it actually uh
yeah okay the like i said if you
0:11:18.000,0:11:20.640
have the really high temperature you
can get stuff that you really don't
0:11:20.640,0:11:26.560
do not expect um all right moving on we'll come
back to uh augmenting techniques in a later video
0:11:27.760,0:11:32.720
okay so here we are this is what we want the the
prompt to look like so this is what we're going
0:11:32.720,0:11:40.480
to record and then the output will just be the
completion um and so then what we do is we'll do
0:11:40.480,0:11:46.720
save file and actually let's do a file
name real quick file name equals time
0:11:48.080,0:12:01.600
plus dot text actually no file name will be will
be uh let's see i need to remove the ands from it
0:12:02.720,0:12:12.480
so we'll do what's the shortest one so we'll
do place um place period genre okay yeah
0:12:14.000,0:12:24.560
place plus period plus genre plus modifier um and
then we will because each one of these is going
0:12:24.560,0:12:31.840
to be unique it's only going to touch it once
so then we'll do replace space with nothing and
0:12:31.840,0:12:38.080
then we'll also do replace the and sign because
i don't think i don't think it'll save that as
0:12:38.080,0:12:47.600
a file and then we'll add dot text and then we'll
do save file so the content of the file will be um
0:12:48.560,0:12:55.200
wait make sure i file path is first okay so
f uh so we're going to save the prompt out to
0:12:56.000,0:13:02.960
prompt and then we'll do uh percent
file name and then we'll do out prompt
0:13:04.400,0:13:08.400
and then we'll do save file so basically
what i'm doing is i'm saving the prompt
0:13:08.400,0:13:14.080
and completion with the same file name but to
different folders so then we'll do completions
0:13:14.960,0:13:23.680
dollar s or a percent s percent file name and then
completion um and there you have it that should be
