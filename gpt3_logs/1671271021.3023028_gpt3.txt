0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:16:43.620,0:16:49.500
so if this happens then you have like okay what
if you have photonic neural networks right what
0:16:49.500,0:16:55.920
if you have photonic transistors that operate in
instead of in the gigahertz range they operate
0:16:55.920,0:17:02.040
in the terahertz range right what if you suddenly
have processors that are a thousand times faster
0:17:02.040,0:17:08.700
and a thousand times less energy that means that
our Computing is going to be nearly as efficient
0:17:08.700,0:17:15.900
as our brains so our brains best estimates right
now operate on about our our exascale computers
0:17:15.900,0:17:23.400
right the the amount of computation that our brain
does three pounds of of uh neurons is about uh you
0:17:23.400,0:17:31.140
know one exaflop of processing power by comparison
the current exit exascale computers that we have
0:17:31.140,0:17:37.380
consume about 20 megawatts of power you compare
that to the 20 watts of power that our brain uses
0:17:37.380,0:17:42.180
and our brains are literally a million times as
efficient as the most powerful computers today
0:17:42.180,0:17:49.200
well if silicon or if um if photonic Computing
is a thousand times more efficient than silicon
0:17:49.200,0:17:55.860
then that means that that it's still it's still
a thousand times uh more energy intensive than
0:17:55.860,0:18:02.580
our brains but that's a thousand X rather than a
million x right so these kinds of breakthroughs
0:18:02.580,0:18:09.120
again it's really difficult to to predict what's
going to happen because suddenly if this happens
0:18:09.900,0:18:17.040
then it you know let's let's say let's let's
assume that the cost is commensurate right so
0:18:18.000,0:18:24.600
you know your GPU today if you switch that to
a photonic GPU suddenly you have 8K Graphics
0:18:24.600,0:18:33.480
running at a thousand frames per second and you
know eight quadrillion uh vertices or a um uh
0:18:33.480,0:18:40.680
planes what is it texels I don't remember the term
for graphics anyways you're going to have Graphics
0:18:40.680,0:18:46.560
that are sharper than your vision right if if
you if you have a photonic you know graphics card
0:18:47.580,0:18:52.500
um another thing that that could happen is all
the large language models that we're using today
0:18:52.500,0:18:57.300
that cost millions of dollars to train instead of
millions of dollars to train they cost thousands
0:18:57.300,0:19:03.480
of dollars to train and then instead of instead
of um you know costing pennies to run per minute
0:19:03.480,0:19:08.220
they cost you know a thousandth of a penny
per minute to run they become trivial right
0:19:09.180,0:19:16.080
um if the cost of AI becomes trivial even what
we have today if you lower the cost of running
0:19:16.080,0:19:23.460
it by a factor of 10 or 100 or a thousand
excuse me a little stuffy um then business
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.240
is not going to be able to adopt AI fast
enough it's going to be run as fast as you can
0:19:30.900,0:19:37.260
Implement as much as you can because the marginal
cost of this stuff is is near zero again marginal
0:19:37.260,0:19:42.480
cost and then imagine if the power cost also
reaches near zero because of Renewables infusion
0:19:42.480,0:19:48.360
so this is where you get those compounding returns
between energy and computation because then you
0:19:48.360,0:19:55.680
have more AI that is able to better to make to
model Fusion better you have better AI that's
0:19:55.680,0:20:01.920
better that's that's able to help you design
better batteries right better uh solar panels
0:20:01.920,0:20:07.560
better medicine and you get these compounding
returns particularly between computation
0:20:08.640,0:20:14.460
um specifically Ai and deep learning and energy
where you get this positive feedback loop and
0:20:14.460,0:20:20.460
then it just away it goes until you hit some kind
of point of diminishing return so I want to touch
0:20:20.460,0:20:26.040
on that real quick is you know yes it looks
like we're accelerating exponentially right now
0:20:26.580,0:20:33.000
but the question is are we going to follow a um
a hyperbolic curve where it just accelerates to
0:20:33.000,0:20:39.960
Infinity are we going to take a parabolic curve or
are we going to follow a sigmoid curve personally
0:20:39.960,0:20:46.980
I talked to a lot of scientists friends and they
see that once once a space is fully like explored
0:20:46.980,0:20:53.760
research slows down um so there are that we should
expect to see diminishing returns this is always
0:20:53.760,0:20:58.560
true pretty much everything follows diminishing
returns it's just a matter of where on that
0:20:58.560,0:21:04.320
sigmoid growth curve are we at have we passed that
midpoint where the acceleration is going to start
