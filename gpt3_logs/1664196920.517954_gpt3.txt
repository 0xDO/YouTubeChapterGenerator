The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: different so in a future version I'll probably what I'll do is show you how to integrate from a corpus of facts of of of like other information rather than just relying on confabulation and neural recall so this when you ask when you ask gpt3 to just barf out a bunch of facts that's called neural recall and it can be pretty accurate um but it can also be crazy wrong um Okay so let's see what happens if we just do this iteration a couple more times so it's just [Music] whoops oh and it's just jumping down okay foreign it's actually making it shorter oh no clarified it a little bit okay okay so this this seems like it works okay so let's add this as a um so we'll do section second draft and then we'll do this as research add a double new line there just to make it nice and consistent and then we'll prompt um uh excuse me Pros um I actually do prompt improve Pros and then we'll just Stitch it all together and that's all programmatic um okay fault temperature to 7 The Tokens to one thousand because that's what we want all right uh let's see yeah um well first we need the uh the topic okay so topic equals open file and we'll do topic.txt so I will save that here so save topic dot text [Music] all right so we get the topic and then the first thing we do is outline it and then we improve the outline okay I've got too many tabs open let me close some of these ah no don't close that one cancel cancel [Music] abort okay and then we'll say um let's see outline equals change [Music] um yeah here I'll just do this the messy way I can work on cleaning it up and making it more efficient later I have coffee and I'm not drinking it what the heck is wrong with me [Music] epic um okay so now we're gonna do build the outline prompt equals open file so this was see this is why I need to keep at least the prompts open all right so prompt outline and then it'll be prompt improve outline and then section research which will just run a few times prompt improve Pros um okay and then Pros okay cool so the outline we only run once so do prompt outline dot text and then we'll do dot replace um topic or no I guess it was request yeah so just to keep things consistent we'll do request because the worst thing you can do for yourself is use use multiple names for the same variable it's very confusing I do not recommend that yeah all right sorry I'm having to lean away from from my microphone again and it's making it's throwing off my whole keyboard situation as someone who writes it's like there's this flow connection um and you can't hear it because I've got the uh the like noise cancellation but I use a mechanical keyboard so you're welcome for that for you seeing the thing I use Nvidia broadcast which is really helpful um okay so we're replacing it request with the request that should be good um and then we'll do um outline equals we'll do one um plus and we're going to remove that and then we'll do plus um gpt3 completion prompt okay and then for debug we'll just print the outline and we'll run this to make sure that it works um python generate whoops CD Auto Muse blogger python generate [Music] request.txt right because I changed the file name in here but it didn't read my mind and change the file name out here okay try that again okay cool so that worked that looks good um all right so then what did I do I did um see this is this is why you write down what your plan is open the readme back up um okay so we got that iterate on the list that's right we did this about four times um okay so then we'll say um for I and list range zero four we are going to do outline equals improve outline and then we'll pass it the request and the outline and so basically this is this is the easiest way to do a recursive thing so we'll do def improve outline and we're going to have the request and the outline passed in and so then we're just going to use this prompt um so we say prompt equals open file prompt improve outline dot text and so what you're seeing here this is this is the um the most basic form of recursive programming with gpt3 where you feed the same the output into the same function several times um so dot replace request with request and then dot replace [Music] um outline with outline make sure that I use the right terminology yes outline is there brainstorm some possible improvements okay and then we'll copy the same outline one dot and so the reason that you have to include this is because the prompt already has that see if you don't have that then the first one will not have its numbered list and that just it just it's bad form and it doesn't look good and then we'll do return outline okay so then we will um here we'll actually for debug purposes I'll just leave all this to do new line new line outline and then we'll do improved outline okay now let's test this real quick what is Shinto tips for visiting facts okay so it is it is reliably recreating what we wanted and then it converged uh and then it blew it up curse you okay yeah it didn't it it just it randomly nuked it okay let's have fewer iterations because if you do if you if you if you try your luck it will eventually Break um the coolest Tory gates in Japan different types of Contour Gates okay so doing One initial iteration and then three iterations seems to be good all right so we'll leave it at that um cool so actually it can be kind of fun to leave the uh the debug output so I'll probably just leave that there so that when you're running it you can see what it's doing okay now we consult the scriptures we got the good list brainstorm some facts or points for each one yes okay so then section research yes okay so sections equal outline dot split lines so now the sections list we can iterate on this um a few times but we're actually zeroing in on the final product so let me think of how to do this because do we want to write it one section at a time I think we do yeah because the way that the way that it breaks down now is we do the research on the section

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

To generate a good blog post, we need to gather information from a variety of sources. In this case, we'll use a corpus of facts as our primary source. We'll also use confabulation and neural recall to fill in the gaps.

Our first step is to gather the facts. We'll use a prompt to ask gpt3 to barf out a bunch of facts. This is called neural recall. It can be accurate, but it can also be crazy wrong. So, we'll iterate a few times to improve the accuracy.

Next, we'll outline the facts. We'll use a prompt to ask gpt3 to improve the outline. This will help us organize the information.

Finally, we'll research the facts. We'll use a prompt to ask gpt3 to improve the research. This will help us fill in the gaps.

After we've gathered all the information, we'll stitch it all together and that's all programmatic.
