The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: what's up everybody david shapiro here for another video before i get started i wanted to um just show you guys some numbers um and this is just i'm still in awe i don't understand why this is happening but it is so like view count is going up exponentially watch time is going up exponentially and subscribers are going up exponentially so whatever i'm doing you guys like it so i'm gonna keep doing it um also audience um there was let's see where is it uh age and gender okay so this is fascinating to me um it's roughly two-thirds male one-third female it used to be a little bit more balanced but it's becoming slightly less balanced but most of the audience is younger than me i'm 36 and so most of y'all are younger than me so it's like this is great this is exactly the people i wanted to reach why because y'all are the next generation whatever i don't finish you all have to pick up the torch and carry so anyways with that being said we are going to finish our um our creative writing coach today so i started this um because this was an idea from reddit where someone said hey it would be really great if you could have a a chat bot or or something that provides like professional feedback about like tone and style not just like um not just like correcting grammar and stuff and i was like got you got you covered so let's do a quick review about what we did last time um here let me just go to the folder of our creative writing coach okay so the first thing that i did was you need data right you need data when you're when you're doing this kind of thing you can generate synthetic data you could ask gpthree to generate um lots of uh lots of uh like fake stories and you could even ask it to do errors um and uh there's a problem with this and i don't fully understand the math but part of the problem is that these large language models tend to kind of go towards the average and so like and people on the on the on the community forum have noticed this that it's like it's kind of the average of what humans produce but what gpt3 produces is still slightly inhuman and so you're going to get much more variance much more variability when you get data from real humans so i just wrote this quick script to download a bunch of stories um from uh from reddit because there is a subreddit called writing prompts actually here let me just show you reddit.com slash r slash writing prompts there we go okay so let me show you what this what this looks like in case i don't know if i showed you last time so basically what someone does is they post a writing prompt and then all the top level comments except for the first one are stories and they they're they vary in length some of them are just short poems some of them are like novellas basically um and so this is a great place to get training data for this so what i did was i wrote a script that um that gets all the that uh well first it gets all the top posts from that subreddit so it says get the top for the last month so this little string here it says get everything for the last month but put it in json format so it's data um so this is what it looks like but if you remove the json part so the dot json you remove that and it's just t month this says okay top of everything for the last month so i did that because the top ones are going to have more responses and so you see like you know there's 193 comments 162 comments but we only wanted the top level comments so we get the top posts of the last month so that's this page and then from then from within each of those um we get the comments and so what that did what that does is we say okay so comments we get the first layer of children and then we say for comment and comments we get the data and the body of that comment so we didn't recurse through because we don't want all replies we only wanted the top level replies so that's like um it got it would get the bot so we'd get rid of the bot um and but it would get like this one which is a story it would get this one which is a story so on and so forth so that's what we did so we downloaded um after cleaning it up 388 stories of varying lengths excuse me the longest one is i think i already deleted some of the ones that were too long there was ones that were like 18 kilobytes but this one is 10 000 characters long so that's um that's that's probably a little too long let's see how many tokens that turns out to be so 10 000 characters almost exactly 2 300 tokens okay so that can fit in the current da vinci model the text o2 because the maximum length is four thousand tokens but yeah so it's it's roughly four to one because ten thousand um ten thousand uh characters is twenty three hundred tokens um okay so i'll update my my ratio because i had it as three to one so it's roughly four to one okay so that's where we're at um that's what we did last time let's see the other thing that we did was i started working on the prompt so um let's see we had what was prepare prompts generate completions i don't think i got this far yet yeah prompts and whoops ah come back slow down and completions okay we did try and generate some completions but i didn't like them that was the problem okay um yeah so that this was as far as we got last time where um now now that i'm up to speed let me show you um so here's a short script that just you know generates the completions excuse me um and so i ran a few and i was i was kind of not happy with it because it tended to um to give uh i mean the advice was good enough but it tended to give it in a list and i'm like i don't really like that like um i want i want to see my feedback um written like you know uh written more like a paragraph um so let's say write one or two paragraphs um okay so we're at the point of prompt engineering um so what i've written here is adopt the persona because once you tell gpthree what it is you say like you know i am this um adopt the persona of a professional creative writing editor we can probably even shorten

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

David Shapiro explains how the view count, watch time, and subscriber count for his videos have been increasing exponentially. He attributes this success to the fact that his audience is mostly made up of young people who are the next generation. Shapiro then goes on to say that he is finishing up his creative writing coach today. This coach is a chatbot that provides feedback about tone and style, not just grammar. Last time, Shapiro showed how he wrote a script to download stories from Reddit. This time, he demonstrates how he wrote a script to generate completions for writing prompts. The goal is to have the bot provide feedback in a paragraph format.
