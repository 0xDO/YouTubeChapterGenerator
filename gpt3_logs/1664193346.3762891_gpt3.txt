CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I've been thinking a lot about how to solve problems as a group, and I think consensus is a great method. It encourages everyone to put in their full brain power, which means that better solutions will be found than if anyone was working alone.

I'm currently working on three books: Symphony of Thought, which is about artificial intelligence; Post Nihilism, which is a commentary on the current zeitgeist; and the first novel in my trilogy. I'm also going to be meeting with an editor tomorrow to discuss my novel.

I'm really excited about the future of the community, and I think consensus is a great way to move forward. Thanks for all the support everyone has been phenomenal.
