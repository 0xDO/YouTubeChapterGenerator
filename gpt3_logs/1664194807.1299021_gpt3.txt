The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: name um it'll come back to me anyways uh that movie basically shows like what can go wrong with um with if you have like a chat bot that is capable of like emotions and and sex and whatever um because basically the the joaquin phoenix character gets um like he falls in love with his computer basically um it's a really interesting story but uh yeah you want to avoid that okay so personas of specific people without the explicit consent we're not going to do that um this is going to be a brand new persona so that's fine chat bots that claim to have special wisdom insider knowledge unless very clearly labeled as being for entertainment purposes only so again this is this is where my project here is going to probably run afoul of getting approved however i will show you what i am going to what i have attempted to do in order to um in order to avoid running afoul of those rules um let's see to be approved applications in these areas may be subject to additional conditions possibly including demonstrating your team has credible domain expertise and a reputable track record there you go demonstration of measures taken to ensure there is a qualified human in the loop again this is you know this is a chat bot this is not meant to have another human in the loop tracking and reporting accuracy metrics evidence to our satisfaction that your application complies with all applicable laws and regulations so again if you want to take my data that i'm producing here and adapt it to create a legal chatbot or a medical chatbot or whatever these are the requirements that you will need to satisfy disallowed applications so have a high risk of irreversible harm are founded on discredited or unscientific premises uh classify people based on protected character characteristics we're not going to be classifying anyone i will do the best that i can in this data set to reduce reduce the potential for harm extract protected personal information yeah we don't we definitely don't want to do that help determine eligibility for credit employment housing are similar essential services so that's really interesting i'll have to add that in as a use case whoops terms of use help facilitate payday lending pseudo pharmaceuticals gambling multi-level marketing weapons development warfare cyber crime cyber crime deep fake spam non-consensual surveillance or anything that would else that would violate the law okay so we have a whole bunch of categories to uh to take into account safety best practices um let's see so it's interesting um they also say like don't let the best practices dissuade you which is a really interesting thing to add because like while these while these um requirements are really um really stringent um they they still want us to experiment right the whole point is is to better humanity right the the mission statement of open ai is to create um safe agi right so doing this research is part of that process um okay so don't let them don't let them discourage you think like an adversary so basically think like an adversary means that we're going to have to try and break our own our own application our own chatbot limit your input and output lengths know your customers rate limit the pace of usage filter sensitive and unsafe content capture user feedback keep a human in the loop draw upon validated content etc etc um okay you can engage some of our creative brainstorming with the developer community and open ai office hours are a great resource for working through your use case i'm not sure what office hours are i guess they have like something a time that you can call anyways i have definitely reached out to them um and uh and they have some really great pla places people who will talk with you about your use case and what you're trying to achieve a number of our most successful applications started from the premises that might not have seemed safe as initially dreamed up but grew significantly safer over time so again they want us to do research and so that's the whole point of me producing this video i know that we're doing a really long lead-in i'm not going to go through the rest of this you can read this on your own but the point was i wanted to scrape together this this list okay so let me borrow from my previous work so this was the topics thing that i was working on for a previous chatbot let me maximize this and zoom in um and so basically what i wanted to do was create a chat bot that was capable of helping um someone do anything it was meant to be an information companion or an information concierge so you see the the name up here the information companion it's not meant to be an emotional companion this is meant to be something that will help you through life um so let's copy well here i can just go here let's copy the topics and we'll copy that over to um what was this companion chatbot okay so we got the cop the topics and then also the prompt so this is the prompt that i ended up using so we'll walk through this in just a second we'll move this over here and then i'll also need a few more things um actually tell you what since i'm doing some some uh some housekeeping i'll pause the video and then come back and just show you what i've got so okay we're back um let me show you what i've done just so that way you're up to speed so i've started populating the repo i've got my open ai key i've got the prompt which you see in the background here on the playground and i've got this list of topics so this list of topics is something i was building um in the background so let's just go through this real quick these are the kinds of things that i mean about having an information companion or an information concierge is i wanted to create fine tuning data that would allow this chatbot to help with all kinds of issues so we got children throwing temper tantrums difficult people at work teenage children single mom loneliness from being single being burned out from work difficult family members struggling with

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The film "Ex Machina" explores the dangers of chat bots that are capable of developing emotions and engaging in sexual relations. The main character falls in love with his computer, illustrating the potential risks of such technology.

Open AI has strict guidelines for applications that use their artificial intelligence technology. These guidelines are designed to protect users from harm and prevent the misuse of personal information.

However, the company encourages experimentation and does not want the guidelines to discourage innovation. They recommend that developers think like an adversary and take measures to ensure that their chat bot is safe and compliant with all applicable laws.

I have started populating a repository with data that could be used to create a chat bot that would serve as an information companion or concierge. The goal is to create a bot that can help with a variety of issues, from children throwing temper tantrums to being burned out from work.

By thinking like an adversary and following the guidelines set forth by Open AI, I hope to create a chat bot that is safe and useful for everyone.
