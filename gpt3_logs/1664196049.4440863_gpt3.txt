The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: the output so you see where we've got the double new line so you can kind of see each each section um and all told the length is 45 000 characters um this is alice in wonderland and the input was 174 000 characters so we go from um let's see 174 down to 45 so let's see 45 divided by what did i just say 174 okay so that's right that's almost exactly a quarter um so it's a quarter the length um you could do this with anything so like i said i've gotten questions about like can you do this with um with uh uh like text uh like um academic texts yes you can do this with uh academic text legal contracts um works of fiction whatever you want and it will summarize it uh pretty pretty concisely um once you get to the end you see like you know it's basically just summarizing you know gutenberg um so on and so forth uh but yeah up until that point it's nice and nice and concise um alice falls asleep by a river and has a curious dream in which he's put on trial for stealing the queen's tarts the evidence against her is entirely circumstantial but the jury finds her guilty and she is sentenced to death however before the sins can be carried out alice wakes up and realizes it was all just a dream alice is sitting on the riverbank with her sister and she notices a white rabbit running by she follows the rabbit down a hole finds herself in wonderland she has a series of adventures looks like it's repeating the end um interesting uh yeah so there you have it though that's that's pretty much all there is to it um i'll i guess we'll just do a get status get add git commit am um done and done and get push so yeah feel free to use this um what you can do because i already hear people like asking about word documents or pdfs and all that i've done is python or powershell or whatever you just save those as dot text files and that works just fine um so like basically it'll it'll just remove all the formatting um because gpt3 doesn't understand the xml background of a of a word document microsoft word or how to read a pdf file it only reads plain text but even then you'll still see that like it'll do a pretty good job you could change the prompt to like change this to d um change it back to like concise um and it'll get even shorter you'll get a factor of like 10 to one um but what i what you know at the beginning of this video i showed you you're at risk of losing important details if you say concise summary and then what you could do so say for instance um you wanted to run this again i could you could modify the script to like run it again so that you just treat the output as the next input and then you could you could uh you could make it even shorter i'm not going to worry about that right now because literally all you would do if you want to try this you just copy the output to the input whoops and then just run it again um or you add another loop again i'm not going to worry about that you can play with that if you want to but yeah there you have it um i think i think i'll call it a day thanks for watching
