The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everyone david shapiro here with a video um you might have noticed that my videos are a little bit more sparse lately and the reason is because i've got three non-fiction books that i'm working on getting out of the door as well as my trilogy and i think it's time to really knuckle down and get those i've achieved a lot of my research goals and my research will continue [Music] in terms of artificial cognition um and that's actually one of the books that i'm writing i'm also writing a book on philosophy and um and a few other things so anyways the point of today's video is i wanted to talk about the difference between being multi-disciplinary interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary so multi-disciplinary and i apologize if i get these these definitions wrong multi-disciplinary is when you have a team where every individual has one specialization and they all contribute to the same problem interdisciplinary is when you have disparate dis disciplines coming together to transform and create a new discipline but it's still individuals and then when you're transdisciplinary it is when you as an individual merge many disciplines and and then create something new and so that's what i'm doing um with artificial cognition and so what i wanted to do was share my bookcase um so here on the top shelf i've got all kinds of books on neuroscience and well mostly neuroscience on this side and then i've also got a whole lot of psychology and and other aspects of the mind so top shelf i've got psychology and neuroscience and mental health and i have read pretty much well yeah all the books almost all the books on that shelf with just accepting a couple here and there um my second bookshelf is so here on the left i've got um i've got social sciences and history um i have i have there's a few of these that i haven't gotten to yet but i have also read most of these and then i've also got business books um and then i've got some other random stuff here at the end and i'll say that you know psychology and neuroscience um is you know that's pretty obvious in terms of how it relates to creating artificial general intelligence or artificial cognition and so like when you look at artificial intelligence from the perspective of say evolution and neuroscience and biology it looks very different than when excuse me when you look at it from the perspective of math and science and coding now i what's not reflected on this bookshelf is my 15 years of experience in technology and so what i'm doing is i'm becoming a transdisciplinary inventor i guess and that i'm bringing 15 years of my professional experience with systems engineering which is getting large complex systems of network of networks and computers to communicate to produce outcomes and that's exactly what i'm doing with artificial cognition i'm viewing intelligence as a system not as a monolith and so you combine you know social science and psychology and neuroscience and business and all my professional experience with that and you get uh a different perspective my third shelf is uh fiction i've got a little bit more fiction over here and i will say that fiction is important because fiction is a really great way to kind of fertilize your mind but my the other part of my bottom shelf this is all about spirituality philosophy and mysticism um and so i've also read i once again i've pretty much read almost all of this bookcase with a few exceptions here and there and so you know one of the reasons that i'm writing a book on philosophy is because i am merging everything that i've learned about evolution and neuroscience and biology with everything that i've learned about philosophy for the philosophy of science the philosophy of information and it's almost like this is a necessary step in order to say like this is the underpinning philosophy behind the ethics and morality that i am working on for artificial cognition and there's this like there's this expansiveness that happens that that i noticed was happening because every time i would get to an impasse with designing artificial cognition and designing these systems i was like wait i need to learn more about this because for instance with my core objective functions or the heroes to comparatives um it's like okay i had the intuition that you know reduce suffering and increase prosperity and increase understanding was good but i needed to back it up like why and so then you know i went and read all kinds of books brain trust by patricia churchlin was a really good one on task by david bader all these other books and i was like okay yes now i understand that these are actually good objective functions for an artificial entity and now i can back it up and say why um and everything that i have learned either professionally or through these books or through my independent research all comes together in the design of artificial cognition so anyways i just wanted to give this update and explain that you know you probably won't see many coding videos they'll probably still happen here and there as i'm doing experiments to write about in my book so one book that i'm working on is called useless platitudes and truisms it is a book of proverbs and quotations and i just submitted that to get test printed yesterday so hopefully i'll get a copy of physical copy of that back in the next few weeks that book is it was mostly a joke the the point of it was i love quotations and proverbs um they serve as like little tiny verbal reminders of like how to live and how to solve problems and so i scraped together about five or six hundred different proverbs and quotations the first draft i tried to make it with gpt3 and i ended up having to rewrite the whole thing so it was originally going to be touted as you know this was a book written by ai but it was too formulaic and so i had to you know make give it my own touch um the book on artificial cognition that i'm working on is symphony of thought where i will be documenting the

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I wanted to talk about the difference between being multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans-disciplinary. Multi-disciplinary is when you have a team where every individual has one specialization and they all contribute to the same problem. Interdisciplinary is when you have disparate disciplines coming together to transform and create a new discipline, but it's still individuals. When you're transdisciplinary, it is when you as an individual merge many disciplines and create something new.

I'm writing a book on artificial cognition, and I'm bringing 15 years of my professional experience with systems engineering to the table. I'm viewing intelligence as a system, not as a monolith. I'm combining my knowledge of social science, psychology, neuroscience, business, and all my professional experience to create a new perspective on artificial cognition.

Fiction is important because fiction is a really great way to kind of fertilize your mind. My bottom shelf is all about spirituality, philosophy, and mysticism. I've also read almost all of this bookcase with a few exceptions here and there. Every time I would get to an impasse with designing artificial cognition and designing these systems, I was like, "Wait, I need to learn more about this." For instance, with my core objective functions or the heroes to comparatives, I had the intuition that reducing suffering and increasing prosperity and increasing understanding was good, but I needed to back it up. So I went and read all kinds of books, and I was able to back up my intuition with a solid foundation.

Everything that I have learned either professionally or through these books or through my independent research all comes together in the design of artificial cognition. So anyways, I just wanted to give this update and explain that you probably won't see many coding videos. They'll probably still happen here and there as I'm doing experiments to write about in my book.
