The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video today we are going to be playing 20 questions with gpt3 um I was inspired because last night I hosted an equinox bonfire and as depicted here sorry for the uh the shaky cam I was using the night sight and uh I guess I wasn't holding the camera that steady but um by the end of the night there was a there was a game of 20 Questions going around and I was just thinking to myself this is a word game this is a perfect use case for gpt3 um now I am also collecting new use cases um for a fine tuning project and I'm particularly interested interested in non-profit and education use cases so if you have any ideas for a fine tuning project please let me know I asked on Twitter and I got a few leads anyways getting distracted let's focus on today which is a game um so yeah uh obviously gpt3 it can't drink a beer with you or help you build a bonfire but maybe it can help you have a little bit of fun and cut loose okay so what are the rules different people play 20 Questions differently where like you can ask a categorical question like you know person place or thing that's how I learned originally um where you it's like you give a one-word answer but I looked up the rules and it's apparently yes or no which makes it even easier to play with a machine um so the step one the machine picks a secret word phrase concept so on um the user must ask yes or no questions and I guess it could be users um and then the machine must answer yes or no unless it's a bad question um I guess so if it's a bad question the machine must refuse to answer and tell you to take a hike and then bad questions count against your total so if you ask you know if you don't ask the if you don't ask a yes or no question then you get uh you know you lose you lose some uh questions remaining um yeah okay so we got to start with um some prompt engineering so first thing we're gonna We want is for the model to pick a word um uid generator so since we want um we want a lot of uh Randomness we we need we'll start off with the uuid technique which just adds a little bit more entropy um and then we'll say like well let's just let's just do it and just like pick a random word development okay whoops drawer ah okay so we need to model what are you doing oh I know what's going on okay okay I was hitting the wrong key okay soccer okay good and it gave me a uuid that's no good um actually I think you can hit regenerate there we go one bad Cow Shed predicted a completion that ends with a stop sequence food okay uh we might need to do fuse shot with this um Okay so yeah because if we if we give it um here I've actually got a writing tool random word um ultian so what we can do is uh it's literally just randomword.com I love this because it gives you rare words like it it doesn't it doesn't give you a distribution based on commonality of words it just like takes a dictionary and just throws a dart at a dartboard um I wonder if I could actually use this as a uh well I guess you don't want it to be too you don't want you don't want to go too late because who's going to guess ulti on that's that that's super hard but actually that's a use case um ooh ooh ooh um let's see uh let's see um difficulty um let's or here just um choose difficulty level based upon commonality of words okay so I've found some vocabulary some vocabulary list wow my mouth is not awake um and I was like these aren't good like eyeball like I that's okay but right that would not be necessarily a good 20 questions one um and that would be kind of difficult um we can make these some more um like the more advanced one but what I'm what I'm doing now is I'm generating a list of list of lists basically to accumulate here so we'll have common words so we've got like here's some food items here's some like physical things um and so what I'll do is I'll dynamically generate I'll pull a sampling from from this file once I clean it up and we will we will uh use that to populate that prompt that I was showing you to generate you know the next random thing um so write a long list of um let's see the most famous people in history and so then um we'll do like we'll start with like George Washington because duh and then we'll do Cleopatra uh and then um uh Confucius so we what we want to tell it like globally right so we've got America Egypt China um that should be a good start Michael Jackson Princess Diana Tiger Woods there we go and then randomly Winston Churchill you don't get a space Winston Churchill okay so then we got famous people um of the most famous places in the world and so then we'll do like New York City we'll do the Eiffel Tower um then let's see the Grand Canyon okay we'll we'll take out the because that's just gonna get Superfluous um uh let's see Nile River um what is the name of that temple in India um Angkor Wat is that that's not in India though is it again we want it we want to tell it like be think Global um because if you don't gpt3 just it always defaults to being very american-centric for some reason okay there we go sequencing genome that's not a place gpt3 nice try okay ah there we go um I guess uh let's do like monuments um and historical sites let's see what it gives us interesting oops some of these are pretty cool a lot of them are Rome so very Western Centric um I guess I did say historical sites um that's fine anyways we don't we don't need a uh an empirical list all we need is something to draw from so let's get rid of those lines and then those we got famous people and this is this is for the easy one anyways um okay so we will find and replace Dash with nothing and then we'll also find and replace space with nothing there we go okay so now we've got a list of common words so then what we'll do is we will um let's see do we have um run random import seed choice all right so what we're going to do is clear this out um to do uh choose difficulty I might just have it where you just swap a variable um okay
