The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here with any other another sorry i can speak i promise um brief uh research update so i've got um three micro services working um we've got the simulation microservice which i've been detailing over the last few days i've got the the universal sentence encoder or the embedding microservice running which has also been worked on for the last few days and then the nexus service so i've got all three of these things working together so basically what's going on is here on the right hand side you see a simulation running and in this case the simulation is a text-based simulation that is playing out a scene in uh that's it's an imaginary scene um it starts as just two men playing chess in central park in in new york city um and then it's kind of simulating what's happening um and they uh it just it's it's meant to be a virtual environment for um for testing artificial cognitive entities or agi uh acogs aces all different words mean the same thing um and so then the uh the semantic embedding microservice what it does is it takes as input either a sentence or a paragraph and it spits out a semantic embedding which allows the nexus to then search for it and so what you see over here is the nexus is actually spitting out its logs that it's receiving as it goes and so you see there's a few components that it shows is the timestamp the um the service that generated the message so this is important for orchestrating artificial cognition later on is that the conductor will need to be able to see which services are are producing which messages so that it can provide feedback um so it says hey you know you're misbehaving try a different model or do something else and then it actually has the the memory um in natural language now with each of these records is also the vector and a few other things there's a timestamp a uuid uh the semantic vector the content the service there will be other metadata in the future so for instance um the services will also register which model they're using or which mode they're in um so that metadata will be available to one every other service as well as the conductor but also for that service itself when it needs to fine tune its behavior later it says oh hey this model is not performing well so let's you know let's lower the score of that model so that it can do automated a b testing between different models this will be critical for self-correction and self-control later on in in in the process but so you see um in this case they've been they've been uh playing chess and now they're trash talking each other and getting more and more competitive as the darkness creeps in around them that's great um so this obviously without an agent uh intervening here um you know the story's just going in a previous version the um the men they got into a fist fight and they ended up in jail which was hilarious anyways so these are the first three micro services i just got them running hence the um hence the update next will be the core objective functions or what i sometimes call the heuristic imperatives um so the the the core objective functions are the central thing that um that i am proposing that artificial cognition uses and so uh the the um one way to think of it is like uh what is what is your reason for existing right what is your motivation every day we humans are very open-ended right we have a few basic imperatives such as like eat food drink water seek shelter you know a few like maslow's hierarchy of needs right well with an artificial entity it has no intrinsic needs other than electricity but we shouldn't make our machines intrinsically self-pres give them a sense of self-preservation because that will create a competitive environment and and when whenever you have a competitive environment you ultimately end up for a struggle or end up with a struggle for dominance which is not what we want because we must assume that these artificial cognitive entities will become smarter than us one day and we don't want to be out competed with them so instead we want to be them we want them to be intrinsically cooperative more on that later as i test the core objective functions because you know this simulation over here is talking about like two men playing chess other simulations that i'm gonna run are gonna include um war game scenarios like say for instance a final battle between man and machine how do the core objective functions behave or earth is being invaded by aliens how do the core objective functions behave then or in more benign situations let's say that there's a politically divisive issue um how does the how does the how does the uh the artificial cognitive entity navigate those difficult political issues that are not existential threats um so that is the point of having this simulation service and being able to test this so up next will be the core objective functions microservice which will be like the moral center of our machines um and then after that will be um actions and planning so you need you need an executive service so i had to do a little bit of research i've got my book over there neuroscience for dummies um because i just needed like one last little thing and i i had it mostly right um so the basal ganglia is part of the brain that is responsible for actually taking thought and deciding what to do so it's like the executive function um let's execute on this action and there's two primary behaviors of the basal ganglia one is selection and the other is switching so selection is given a whole host of options because whether or not you're conscious of it your brain is constantly generating dozens hundreds thousands of possible behaviors at any given moment for instance there's canonical neurons which anytime you see an object canonical neurons model what you can do to that object or with that object and so by learning how to interact with the world you have regions of the brain that are constantly telling your your brain

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

David Shapiro gives a brief update on his research into artificial cognitive entities (ACEs). He has three microservices working: a simulation microservice, a semantic embedding microservice, and a nexus service.

The simulation microservice plays out a scene in an imaginary environment. The semantic embedding microservice takes as input either a sentence or a paragraph and outputs a semantic embedding. This allows the nexus to search for the information.

The nexus is a central service that coordinates the other microservices. It includes a memory in natural language, a timestamp, and a UUID. The nexus will also register which model each microservice is using. This metadata will be available to every other service, as well as the conductor (a service that provides feedback to the microservices).

The core objective functions microservice will be the central service for determining the ACE's motivation. This microservice will be tested in different scenarios, including war game scenarios and politically divisive situations.

The final microservice will be the actions and planning microservice, which will be responsible for taking thoughts and deciding what to do. This microservice will use the basal ganglia, which is part of the brain responsible for executive function.
