0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:02:02.520,0:02:08.280
um but by by trying to assign numbers to
things um that like that's that's how you
0:02:08.280,0:02:12.660
get started and there's plenty of other things
within affordances that have nothing to do with
0:02:12.660,0:02:16.980
moral or ethics you can calculate Things
based on how much time it's going to take
0:02:16.980,0:02:23.100
right so time is a cost energetic expenditure is
a cost how much money is it going to cost right
0:02:23.100,0:02:30.900
there's all kinds of things that that our brains
assess the cost and and like reward cost risk
0:02:31.680,0:02:39.660
um and and benefits um all automatically
very fast um anyways so this really sets
0:02:39.660,0:02:44.820
the stage I'm excited to see where this team
and people who take this research go with it
0:02:45.720,0:02:50.700
um I definitely recommend you check it out
they have a simulation version so you can
0:02:50.700,0:02:58.620
just download it and run it yourself the other
thing is uh uh this company engineered Arts
0:02:58.620,0:03:05.040
they have uh integrated gpd3 with their robot
platform so it can have open-ended conversations
0:03:06.180,0:03:11.820
um I'm not going to play the whole conversation
for you um it's very clear that it's it's using
0:03:11.820,0:03:15.540
just kind of some basic gpt3 prompting
so that it can respond to any question
0:03:16.680,0:03:20.940
um I don't know how much they have solved
in terms of long-term conversations
0:03:22.020,0:03:27.300
um but hey if they see this video I'm happy to
talk to them um and and talk about using semantic
0:03:27.300,0:03:32.880
search for uh for holding long-term conversations
although I'm sure other people are figuring out
0:03:32.880,0:03:39.120
long-term longitudinal chat Bots what's going to
be interesting is when you have humanoid robots
0:03:39.120,0:03:45.120
with long format conversations and cognitive
architectures for solving problems and following
0:03:45.120,0:03:50.760
instructions that's really like kind of what we're
moving towards and the Tesla bot you know that's
0:03:50.760,0:03:57.720
that's what they want to do so Amica is the name
of I think that's the name of this this chassis
0:03:59.280,0:04:04.680
um uh but the the the company is engineered Arts
so you see they've got their their robotic chassis
