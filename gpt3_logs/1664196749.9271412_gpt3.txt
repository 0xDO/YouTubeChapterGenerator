The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here um we've got a new video so um if you kept up with my work you know that one of my primary purpose is to research and produce artificial cognition or an artificial cognitive entity i prefer this term over agi because artificial general intelligence is just three adjectives um it's not an actual thing whereas an artificial cognitive entity is a thing it's describing the actual result so i want to create something that thinks now in order to have something that thinks you need input you need a world in which to act um well ideally you can have cogitation in a vacuum and i've done plenty of experiments with that but i also recently published the video about my nexus which is the kind of the brain the central brain or the memory of an artificial cognitive entity so the next step is to produce the input now because this is testing i need a simulated environment and since it thinks in natural language i don't need actual video and audio i can run the simulation in video and so that's what i'm working on today so let me show you what i've done so first i started with a world state so in this case the world state is two men are sitting in a stone at a stone chest tape sorry stone chest table i actually stopped stuttering if you watch some of my original videos i had a i had a stutter sometimes i wonder if i was just nervous comes back every now and then anyways they're playing chess the sun is shining etc etc so then i fed that into a prompt where it says this is a text-based simulation giving given the following world state imagine a likely a random event describe the event in one or two sentences and so then it spits out an event and then we take that we take that state and event and plop it into this prompt which says generate a new world state or measure the impact that it has in the world state and then finally i take all three of those and say summarize this into a new world state i might have to remove detail because the summaries kept getting longer and longer as more stuff happened whereas we can actually exclude information as we move forward now all of this can be fine-tuned which i'll probably do once i generate some synthetic data and clean it up but the idea here is that we have you have state event and change so the state is like describe you know take a picture describe it the event or action is what happens in the world and so in this case i need to be able to integrate that event or action because in the simulation environment my acog is going to have to be able to act it's going to have to be able to say something or do something so that we can test it in isolation and yes i'm actually talking about testing an artificial general intelligence in a text-based simulation that's what's happening this is this is where we're at um and then so you have current state then you have an event or action then you have the impact that that has on the world like if i throw my mug like current world state mug is whole you know i'm in my office i throw my mug that's an event and then the you know the the event or action is mug is tossed it breaks on the floor and now there's you know pieces on the floor so the new world state is the mug is broken and the pieces are on the floor um but the rest of it is also still true so that is the goal here so there's basically three phases state event change and then recycle state event change so it's just those three steps over and over again so i wrote a really quick little script to do this um so first it's just an infinite loop says while true load the last world state oh i need to show you i saved the world states here and then also every gpt3 interaction is logged here this is all open source you're welcome to use this you can use it for games you can use it for simulation you can use it to test chat bots you can use it to test digital robots whatever you want to do um the there's there's more so ultimately this is going to be encapsulated into a microservice so the microservice is going to have to communicate with the acog nexus so it'll basically take the place of the eyes and ears of um of my acog experiment so it'll say it'll have to keep track of its own world state and then the summaries that it produces are going to be the natural language this is what's going on in the outside world react to it um and so you know you can imagine any kind of world state you can say the world state is you know the the world plunges into chaos because of zombies right and gpt3 is really good at writing fiction and then one other advantage is that you have a log of all these world states that you can extract information from but this will also end up in the nexus of the acog so it'll actually remember everything that it has seen seen and heard right so we're simulating senses and we're simulating a world state um yeah okay sorry i was going over the script um so file equals os lister let me zoom in a little bit more um so it just loads the last world state um that's what it does right here then it generates an event so that's the first prompt generate an event um and then it'll print it out and then it'll take that and and generate the new state um and really it's not a new state it's it's measuring the change like what impact has this had and then it'll do the summary um and so that's all it does is then it prints it all out to the console and then saves it that's it so let me show you um so i already ran it once so i started with the original whoops i started with the original world state here where it's just two guys are playing chess this is hilarious um two guys are playing chess one of the men loses his chess piece becomes frustrated and knocks over the chess board so he you know rage rage quits um state change the two men are still sitting at the stone table one of the men has knocked over the chessboard in frustration the sun is still shining and the birds are still singing etc etc um so the new world state the two men

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In my latest video, I explore how to create an artificial cognitive entity (ACE). In order to create something that can think, we need to provide it with input. The best way to do this is to create a simulated environment where the ACE can act.

In this simulated environment, we need to start with a world state. For example, the world state could be that two men are sitting at a table playing chess. Then, we need to generate an event or action. In this case, the event could be that one of the men loses his chess piece and becomes frustrated, leading him to knock over the chessboard.

Finally, we need to measure the impact that this event has on the world state. In this case, the impact would be that the two men are still sitting at the table, but now there is a knocked over chessboard between them.

This process of state-event-change can then be repeated in order to create a more complex world state. For example, we could add that the sun is shining and the birds are singing. This would be the new state. Then, we could generate an event where one of the men gets up and leaves in frustration. This would be the change.

By repeating this process, we can create a more and more complex world state for the ACE to act in. This will provide us with valuable data that we can use to test the ACE's cognition.
