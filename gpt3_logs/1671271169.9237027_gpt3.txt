0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:03.480,0:00:09.600
morning everybody David Shapiro here um first I
need to apologize that it's been so long since
0:00:09.600,0:00:15.240
I've had a video um there's a couple reasons for
it but mostly is uh I've been working too hard
0:00:16.200,0:00:21.960
um many people on my channel have commented on
how fast I work and uh apparently I'm really bad
0:00:21.960,0:00:29.100
at at managing my own stress level so I got myself
a nice Fitbit to uh keep track of those things for
0:00:29.100,0:00:37.500
me um I sprang for the uh the Fitbit premium which
has a like sleep score and daily Readiness score
0:00:37.500,0:00:43.080
and Stress Management score and that's been really
helpful so I've been learning to take better care
0:00:43.080,0:00:49.740
of myself and Pace myself with that being said
I um have a lot more energy so I can tackle this
0:00:49.740,0:00:55.020
project that I've had in the back of my mind for
a while so before we get started on this project
0:00:55.020,0:01:01.380
I need to tell you why I'm doing it so first is uh
the thing that you need to understand is consensus
0:01:01.920,0:01:07.020
now I've talked about this on my channel before
this is one of like if you ever if you read
0:01:07.020,0:01:11.640
only one book this year you should read this
book it changes everything I actually have two
0:01:11.640,0:01:16.800
copies because I lost I lost it and bought
another one but it turns out I lost it just
0:01:16.800,0:01:21.900
because it's so small and it was like tucked
beside a larger book on my bookcase over there
0:01:21.900,0:01:28.200
so now I have two copies I can give one away
anyways it's a short book and it talks about
0:01:28.980,0:01:36.660
the how and why of consensus and also how to
use it to run meetings and stuff it changes
0:01:36.660,0:01:42.600
your life in terms of work it changes your your
home life once you understand consensus now
0:01:43.560,0:01:48.540
an individual doing consensus is one thing or
a small group doing consensus right like I use
0:01:48.540,0:01:57.120
it at work so one example is um without getting
into too many specifics um like if you if you're
0:01:57.120,0:02:03.660
trying to solve a tough technology problem um you
know you might come in if you're egotistical and
0:02:03.660,0:02:07.800
say okay I've got the solution we're going
to do things my way I'm the decider right
0:02:08.940,0:02:13.260
um but if you do that like people don't like
being just told what to do and they also don't
0:02:13.260,0:02:18.180
like being treated like they're dumb so this
is another another principle that comes from a
0:02:18.180,0:02:22.560
book The Fifth Discipline which is humans are
literally the smartest animal on the planet
0:02:22.560,0:02:30.240
treat humans like they are smart and they will
surprise you um you know if you if you treat
0:02:30.240,0:02:34.860
someone like you just want them to be a dumb Cog
in a machine they will eventually start acting
0:02:34.860,0:02:39.060
like a dumb Cog in a machine and you'll have
this self-fulfilling prophecy where you treat
0:02:39.060,0:02:42.900
someone dumb and you don't expect intelligence
of them and then they don't deliver intelligence
0:02:42.900,0:02:47.280
and then you say aha see they didn't deliver
intelligence so that's from The Fifth Discipline
0:02:48.420,0:02:54.240
um consensus is how to be inclusive like this
it's genuinely how to be inclusive and it's not
0:02:54.240,0:03:01.740
saying like we're going to be inclusive but it is
a framework of how to approach problems okay the
0:03:01.740,0:03:05.760
fundamental rule or one of the fundamental rules
of consensus is you have to hear from everyone
0:03:07.020,0:03:11.760
um and all voices are are it's not it's
not even about equality it's just about
0:03:11.760,0:03:19.140
integrating everyone's perspective so
that sets the stage I have had this
0:03:19.140,0:03:29.100
idea of using Ai and automation to simulate
Mass opinions and model entire populations
0:03:30.540,0:03:37.200
um my ex-brother-in-law uh is an economist
and we had conversations about like using
0:03:37.200,0:03:44.160
simulations to model like every individual as
an agent in the economy and he's like that would
0:03:44.160,0:03:50.460
be really difficult but why because you can just
aggregate people um he's a smart guy anyways but
0:03:51.600,0:03:57.660
simulating someone from an as an economic entity
is one thing right because you can you can there's
0:03:57.660,0:04:02.880
a lot of data on how people you know how much
money they make and based on how much money you
0:04:02.880,0:04:08.580
make where you spend that money and you look at
demographics and and so on and so forth but what
