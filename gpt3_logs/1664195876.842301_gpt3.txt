The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: overkill and i wanted the simplest environment possible so notepad plus plus it'll it'll do the um the language for you and everything one reason that i like using notepad plus plus over pycharm is that you have to learn to code correctly um pycharm will do a lot of stuff for you it's kind of like microsoft word and it'll recommend grammar and syntax changes which is great except you don't ever learn to do that yourself and we'll get into best practices for python in a future video but right now we're just focusing on setting up our environment and so what we've done is we've done python we've done git we've done notepad plus plus we've done open ai and then we've gotten this repo now by the time you download this there will be a little bit more in this repo so let me show you what i mean by in the repo so we'll just say copy paste your api key here so then i'll save this file we'll go to what was it uh python there we go um and so we'll call this open ai api key dot text and so we'll save this here and what i'll do is this will end up in here and so you'll go to your open ai account so it'll be um openai.com account api keys right here i'm not going to show you my key but what you do is you you click copy on that and you put it in this folder and so then we're basically just going to do the hello world of of um of gpt3 so import openai we'll just go ahead and save this and i'll save it as hello world.pi and you see that it changed the the formatting so that now import is highlighted i am super guilty of this i always copy paste my own all of my own old code um so i'm gonna do that real quick um and show you some basic functions that i use all the time um all right so we'll go in here oops no don't open that we will open it in a notepad plus plus okay so i always start with these few things right off the top and i'll show you what these do in just a second actually let me check the video length oh we're already at 10 minutes um so we're kind of we're kind of running long already but this will at least get you started with the hello world of of um your your your your life your life in gpt3 so i just write a quick function it's called open file you give it a file path it opens it um with encoding as utf-8 as in file and then it returns the contents of the file and then the very next thing is i return that and i pass this information back and so then what you can do oops is you can borrow this function which will be in this and i'll trim it down for you and you'll know that it works though because we'll i'll have you call this and you'll actually get a prompt or you'll get you'll get a response what i'm going to do is i'm going to simplify it a little bit because if it blows up i want you to do some troubleshooting on your own um and then we'll remove the while loop and we'll remove the accept part and we'll pull that back whoops okay so what this function does the first one super simple it just opens a file reads it and sends it back um we the second thing what we did is we set our api key to the contents of this which you'll need to update um and uh no special important note don't ever commit your api key to a repo because uh then someone else might see it one day that should be local only um we will simplify this [Music] so this is the stop we'll get into what all of these things do later um but yeah so this what this will do is it will just send back a completion and so then we'll say if name equals main [Music] then we'll say um my prompt equals uh what'll be a good prompt um write a list of uh of um famous american actors okay so that'll be our prompt then response will be equals uh gpt3 whoops completion and we'll pass the prompt in and then we'll print the response now i'm not going to run this because your homework is you've got to run this yourself which means you've got to get all this cloned downloaded and put in your api key here and we'll call that a day so just as a quick review here's what we've done we we looked at our xkcd comic from many years ago we downloaded python we downloaded git we downloaded notepad plus plus we installed openai which allows us to talk to gpt3 and then we cloned down this tutorial repo and then i showed you how to get your api key so what you'll do is you'll just click this that copy button come in here to open ai key open ai api key dot text and copy paste it in here make sure there's no spaces or anything it'll just be the first line and that's it and then what you do and this is going to bomb in order to test it you type in python hello world and it's not going to work um except finally oh whoops see this is why you test your code kids what did i miss oh i forgot to remove the try there we go ta-da okay now it works it would be really unfortunate if i sent you code that didn't actually work okay now this will still bomb because the api key is invalid so let me show you what will happen so it'll say hello world it'll say uh hey something didn't work you know uh open ai yep so here's the error right here open ai error authentication incorrect api key provided um it did not like my api key so you need to fix that that is your very first homework so then to save save your work um or to save my work i'll do git add dot so then i do that adds all files so then i do get stat um no git status sorry um so there's two new files to add so i'll do git commit am and we'll do a deeper dive on git in the future and we'll say initial commit and then i'll do git push and so what that does is it says okay every i've looked at all the changes that i've made locally i want to push it back up to the cloud so what we'll do then is we'll go back up to git and i'll just do a quick refresh and you'll see that those files are now here and so these are the files that you're going to use to start learning python and get your environment set up okay i think that's it thanks for watching like and subscribe also consider supporting me on patreon i am just seeing where this

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, we cover how to set up a Python development environment using the Notepad++ text editor. We also briefly discuss the benefits of using this environment over other more full-featured IDE's like PyCharm. Finally, we walk through a simple "Hello World" example of how to use the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
