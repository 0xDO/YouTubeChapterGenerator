0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:33:32.640,0:33:39.780
so we're down to 3.5 3.4 and so it's because
there's some inefficiencies or whatever you're
0:33:39.780,0:33:44.820
you know like the time bar however long it's going
to take so it looks like you don't get much faster
0:33:44.820,0:33:51.000
by doing larger chunks because it's down to about
you know uh just about three hours so it looks
0:33:51.000,0:33:56.940
like that's kind of the optimal because you know
you do bigger chunks you marginal whatever okay so
0:33:56.940,0:34:02.940
two hours much better or three hours much better
than 36 hours so it's 12 times faster if not a
0:34:02.940,0:34:07.620
little bit more because you see this number still
coming down pretty quick all right so we will uh
0:34:07.620,0:34:15.840
go ahead and let this run and then pretty soon we
will have 2.1 million embedded archive things this
0:34:15.840,0:34:19.860
is this is going on data hoarder I think the
folks on data hoarder will love this all right
0:34:23.640,0:34:32.820
and we're back um okay so quickly to bring you up
to Speedos to what I have achieved and what I'm
0:34:32.820,0:34:42.240
working on next um let's see so we well here let
me show you the code um okay generate embeddings
0:34:42.240,0:34:49.860
so I do things in stages modularize it so this
is the final form of of the generate embeddings
0:34:49.860,0:34:56.820
and so we load our embedding engine which is um
tensorflow hubs Universal sentence encoder five
0:34:57.780,0:35:01.200
um you've been watching so you know that I'm just
bringing myself back up to speed because this is
0:35:01.200,0:35:07.920
you know the following day um okay so we break
it into chunks of 300 that took the processing
0:35:07.920,0:35:13.920
time from 36 hours down to less than three so
we got a factor of 12 more than 12 Improvement
0:35:15.180,0:35:22.380
um and then I also just broke it out into
a chunk now I had a try accept so that it
0:35:22.380,0:35:27.240
would handle errors and we actually ended
up we did get a few errors um so we had four
0:35:27.240,0:35:32.940
chunks so that's 1200 articles that didn't
get um indexed but when you compare that to
0:35:34.020,0:35:43.260
um you know the 20 20 2.1 million articles that
did get indexed um or embedded rather we haven't
0:35:43.260,0:35:51.780
done the indexing yet um we'll say that that's a
pretty good pretty good uh uh average um so I'm
