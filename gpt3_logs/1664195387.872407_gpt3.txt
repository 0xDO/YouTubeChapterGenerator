The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: keeping track of multiple uses for those stones and yeah that seems really simple to us but that's because our brains are really good at it okay so once you've given given all the information up here your current context so actually let's call these um oops let's call these our context prompts replace all and then we'll have the control prompts um so once you've got your context established and then you envision what your goal is the next step is you brainstorm so let's do prompt brainstorm not text and also i know that there's a lot and a lot of these prompts are not written so probably what i'll do is um is i'll write all the prompts offline um because i don't think you guys want to well actually no you guys you guys tell me that you want you want to see prompt engineering so we'll do prompt engineering um okay so uh let's see potential steps to um uh let's just say potential goal steps that should be enough um brainstorm okay so brainstorm actions um so this is flexible um and and i'll show you what what i mean by this is flexible in the problem because this is this is a generalized set of instructions um that gpt3 is flexible enough to implement whether or not it's a cognitive task like if you say like i need to think about the future like that's something that it can do here or if it's a physical action like you know i need to grab a rock envisioning and brainstorming both apply um since this one is not going to have any robotic output we're just going to be talking about thinking we'll get to robotics at some point in the future okay so prompt so the first thing we is we have to envision what we want to do so we've got our context which is which is established here so we've got our context and then we've got um we've got our cognitive control which is um kind of okay let's let's design our our next actions um this was about as far as i got honestly um okay so we've got we envision it and then we brainstorm and then we execute um yeah oh you know what something just occurred to me is that once we envision we're gonna this is actually gonna be prompt chaining um because we're gonna feed one into the next okay so we we we build our vision we brainstorm the steps and then the next thing we do is we say okay given our vision and giving these given the brainstorm what is the actual next step because we can only do one thing at a time so let's start there this is just my intuition this could end up being entirely wrong um let's just say uh execution um my uh next action okay so then we'll say execution so this is um so this was what i'd call like executive function right so the final step of cognitive control is actually acting on something so in that example earlier where i said like you see a laundry basket and you start doing laundry this would be like you know um let's say in your context you know it says like oh well i see um you know i saw that there was a laundry basket but i'm gonna choose to ignore that because the house is on fire right like that that's that's a prime example of where like you know adhd or executive function or cognitive control really comes in because you have to keep in mind your whole context and that will help you decide what to do now even someone with adhd like you see laundry you might think about it like if the house is on fire you might see like oh man i should do the laundry um but then you're like immediately after that you're like well the house is on fire right because you've got something in your brain prioritizing what you should be doing okay so i think this is about it um and then let's do metacognition prompts equals and then let's do persona because this one does not figure into the immediate so this is something this is another loop that's going to be going on in the background and it does not figure in directly into these other things it might not need to be split off honestly um but because my intuition says that says that it should be split off so i'm splitting it off okay oops there we go metacognition and philosophy because we want our machine to be thoughtful um someone i had a conversation many years ago um with someone who i think was actually my girlfriend before we were dating um because i was talking about ai and she's like you know one of the questions that people ask is like aren't you afraid of i was like no i am not afraid of a thoughtful machine what i am afraid of is a thoughtless machine that is controlled by evil people so if you have a thoughtful machine that has goals like you know reduce suffering and um and increase prosperity and it's going to think about the philosophical ramifications of its actions and and its own existence i'm not worried about that machine especially after seeing how well gpt3 can handle those those conversations um it's gpt3 will be far more consistent um ethically and morally than than people or it can be i'm not saying will be it can be with the proper um framing structuring and and fine-tuning um so i'm not afraid of a thoughtful machine as long as it's it's well designed okay so we've got our context prompts our control prompts and our metacognition prompts this one will probably change hey okay so what we do is in our immediate thoughts we say context equals um let's see because we'll have memories and then context yeah all right so context equals to do we'll do newline slash join immediate thoughts um yeah i think that's about right and then so we've got memories so we can have the most recent memories we've got our mental context and then we've got our yep so context prompts and then we'll grab our control prompts so um for c in control prompts and um actually let's delete these because that was old thinking and we'll just copy paste this change that to c and c [Music] and c and i don't think we'll need that all right so generate prompt the memory so we'll need we'll need the context but i think we'll also need the memories in our context so when i do when i build the context so we'll say

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to keep track of multiple uses for stones, it is important to have a clear understanding of your current context and what your goal is. Once you have this information established, you can then brainstorm potential steps to take in order to achieve your goal. After you have brainstormed, the next step is to execute your plan by taking action. Throughout this process, it is important to keep in mind your persona and metacognition in order to make sure that your actions are thoughtful and aligned with your goals.
