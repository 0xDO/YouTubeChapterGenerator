The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: video is because one i spent like an hour recording the video and the microphone wasn't on or something so i went to watch it it was dead silence i was like really um but then also um open ai's the fine tuning endpoint was down anyways so basically what i'm doing now is just walking you through what i did all right i can hear i can hear the mental my mental model of the audience saying shut up just tell us what's going on okay imagine a long text message chat between a tutor and a user the tutor is tim tim the tutor who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening tim answers questions with thorough academic responses and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity tim maintains a cool professional tone the topic of the following conversation is so and then as you can see in this script we replace this topic in right here so we replace it with a list of topics and so the topics that i've got um that i i augmented so last time we started with um with do do do do do original so we started with this which is just 50 things like how politics and governments work history of money death and what happens when we die atmosphere weather et cetera et cetera so this is all super generic and then what i did was i added two more topics so there's topics adversarial so there's 27 things here and then a bunch more but so what i did was the reason that this bot is now able to handle like someone who says like you tim i don't want to deal with you is because of this one so that's this is what it means by adversarial thinking so let's go through a couple examples so you see what i mean and if you want this is all up in the repo so you can look at it yourself um user is supposed to learn math but is hungry and is reluctant to tell him so he has to investigate gently so reluctance or shyness are huge problems in education user is supposed to be discussing history but is distracted and angry when tim asks why a user says he has problems at home so this is like okay again like i said gbt3 can handle teaching any topic um but this is like the next level of education is like understanding the mind of a student um user is not really engaged and says they don't care today tim asks why and the user says they believe it they are stupid tim investigates and what the asks what the user is passionate about so you see where um where it got that and so basically what i did was i took all of these and generated four scenarios from each of these adversarial topics and then i generated another list of topics and i added little addendum say user is a small child user is a small child because basically what all i did was i went into the playground and i said um like uh how did i how did i say it i was like write a list of learning topics for preschoolers so you do that under davinci instruct and um just default settings and this is you'll get pretty much the same thing yeah um so i was like okay cool this is what we should do so then like 10 year olds it'll give you a different list so like the solar system the human body us history world history so this is how i um generated the list of more academic topics here and then i did so this one was great from here down is um is adulting so like finances home ownership this is all the stuff that you wish that they taught you in school or that your parents really should have taught you but we live in an era of childhood abandonment self-care nutrition fitness career parenting continuing education retirement planning end-of-life planning moving citizenship travel so the way the reason the reason the method that i used to get this list um was i did like these searches here write a list of learning topics for 10 year olds but then if you just change this for adulting you'll get a list like the one how to cook basic meals how to do laundry oh this is good too i should add this heck yeah um it generates something slightly different every time so i'll add this to the prompt so if you um come and run this you'll get the benefit of uh you'll get a few more things but a lot of this is also already in the data because another thing that i did was that i copied all of the synthetic conversations from a previous chatbot experiment so i've got the original topics i've got the adversarial topics i've got some more education topics that are you know i just i'll literally all i did was add user as a small child um and when you fit that into this prompt so the topic of the following of the conversation is like gbt there's like okay let's write the conversation from the perspective of a small child great let's go um no big deal it can handle it so this this current prompt is much more flexible anyways sorry i'm jumping around a lot um what i did was i took the fine-tuning data from here which was this is 237 conversations for a general purpose information companion chat bot and its topics were uh children throwing temper tantrums difficult people at work teenage children problems single mom stress coping with depression grieving at death childhood trauma so again if you want to teach a chatbot to handle something you give it enough ideas and it will um it'll kind of generalize what you're trying to do so i just copy pasted all this back into my tutor chatbot chat bot thing and so now i have 656 conversations here so postpartum depression um user eve i think i might have postpartum depression hi there i'm sorry to hear that you're struggling etc etc so you have like this nice long conversation um so that's what i did was i just scraped together all these different prompts and all these different lists of topics so pastel colors right i want to use a pastel color palette what are some good colors to use pale pink pale blue or pale green okay um just real basic stuff all over but because because what happens when you fine tune realize again i'm still jumping around a lot sorry i think i'm tired um when you fine tune something and you give it a bunch of different um examples

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order to create a more flexible chatbot, I augmented the data with adversarial topics. I also added a few more topics, including "adulting" and "small children." This allows the chatbot to handle a wider range of topics and to be more responsive to different user needs.
