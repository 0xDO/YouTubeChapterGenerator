0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:31:47.700,0:31:53.820
and I think that they'll be fascinating to to
our audience as well so we've we've set up two
0:31:53.820,0:31:59.280
pillars right uh collaboration and consensus and
the problems with that and then we've also talked
0:31:59.280,0:32:05.160
about language controlled language uh decidability
and and completeness versus incompleteness so
0:32:05.160,0:32:12.000
now let's link the two conceptually how do how do
the problems of um completeness or intractability
0:32:12.000,0:32:18.840
relate to collaboration and consensus and
this will also lead into Tao's Solutions how
0:32:18.840,0:32:24.180
have you guys solved these problems and brought
everything together Ohad would you like to start
0:32:25.920,0:32:31.800
and yes in fact there is one big problem
that we didn't speak about because the
0:32:31.800,0:32:38.040
problems that we did speak about up until
now have Solutions in the literature of
0:32:38.040,0:32:43.620
mathematical Logic the other side of
the languages and there are solutions
0:32:44.220,0:32:48.780
but there is one big big problem that has no
solution and we had to invent the solution
0:32:50.280,0:32:56.940
and the problem is a language that can speak
about truth of other sentences in the language
0:32:58.980,0:33:06.060
the logicians proved that in a certain form
and such a language cannot be consistent
0:33:06.060,0:33:10.980
it must contain a contradiction this is
called tarsky's undefinability of Truth
0:33:12.960,0:33:20.820
but there is a serious real-life
need in being able to do so
0:33:21.600,0:33:28.980
so we need to find we needed to find a way to
have maybe a more limited setting not exactly the
0:33:28.980,0:33:33.720
setting the task he considered but still allowing
us to speak about rules of other sentences
0:33:35.940,0:33:41.100
and this we can relate it to with two examples to
0:33:42.000,0:33:48.000
well maybe three examples to
blockchain to Ai and to real world law
0:33:49.980,0:33:57.300
so we spoke about blockchain that is controlled
by its users taking it more down to earth
0:33:59.220,0:34:02.100
so in each block you are gonna have
0:34:03.660,0:34:09.660
the code of the network itself a
definition of what the network should do
0:34:11.160,0:34:18.000
the whole point in blockchain is a condition
of accepting or rejecting a proposed block
0:34:20.340,0:34:25.020
but for example in proof of world you accept
it if the harsh satisfy certain conditions
0:34:28.140,0:34:36.600
but if the code contains if the block
contains statement of the them Network itself
0:34:37.320,0:34:44.160
and the current Network need to speak about
this those statements ask questions about those
0:34:44.160,0:34:47.940
statements all in the same language otherwise
you're going to need Infinity many languages
0:34:49.680,0:34:57.480
and get an answer so that's a blockchain
example take an AI example there are the
0:34:57.480,0:35:02.520
three laws of robotics by Asimov that the
robot will never harm humans and so on
0:35:04.140,0:35:08.100
I say that you need a fourth
law for boutiques which is that
0:35:08.820,0:35:13.380
any future software update of the
robot will also admit a lot of robotics
0:35:14.280,0:35:20.820
you don't want to plug in a USB key to the robot
with software update and it starts killing people
0:35:20.820,0:35:25.380
you want the robot to reject this update
if it does not admit the rules of robotics
0:35:26.220,0:35:30.720
this is the same problem that the current
field of mathematical logic cannot handle
0:35:32.400,0:35:37.440
the update is written in the same language
that the robot is written and you need
0:35:37.440,0:35:43.020
the same language to ask whether another
statement in that language is consistent
0:35:44.220,0:35:47.580
with another statement being
the laws of robotics um
0:35:49.800,0:35:52.980
self example the law of changing the law
0:35:54.360,0:35:58.500
you have law or height now you
also need laws of changing the laws
0:35:58.500,0:36:02.340
because if you don't have a lot of changing
materials then either you cannot change them
0:36:04.920,0:36:10.020
or there are no conditions of changing the law
energize me English you can always change it
