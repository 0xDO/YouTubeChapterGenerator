TRANSCRIPT: and then finally this goes back to being autodidactic each microservice will use data from the nexus for training and refinement over time so as it gains experiences and it gets feedback from other models then it will learn to do its own job better so basically think of it as a generative adversarial network with multiple services all contributing all right so what microservices are planned or needed so here on the right i have just a real basic diagram of the first handful of microservices where we've got the nexus which remember is basically a syslog server some kind of output a simulation service so rather than having input from the real world where i'm starting is having it in simulation because that's safer and easier anyways the heuristic imperatives conductor discernment prediction okay so again uh hub uh star topology hub and spoke so the nexus we already talked about the nexus that's the center of everything the oops sorry come back um the conductor is what does cognitive control and we'll go over that in just a minute the heuristic imperatives is also critical we'll go over that in just a second then other microservices would be input or sensors like cameras and microphones whatever they whatever input comes into meragi it must be a natural language again everything is going to be a natural language so if you have a piece of hardware it whatever whatever that whatever that piece of hardware picks up it must then be translated into natural language before it's put into the nexus then you might have planning services so planning services are going to be like okay based on this goal how do i get there what are the steps that i need to do discernment so that's like risk and costs a cost assessment so discernment is a discriminative type of service where it says okay i shouldn't do that because it's too dangerous or i shouldn't do that because it's going to take too long that kind of thing prediction and forecasting so prediction or forecasting is about saying okay based on the way things are going now and these ideas this is how i think it's going to turn out and that's all it does it just predicts the future and adds that information back into the nexus so that other services can make use of those predictions um then we also need an llm and or embeddings of some sort and so these it's kind of floating off because all the other this is the only service that other microservices use but this could be like a cloud-based service it could also be a local model that's running on hardware it doesn't necessarily have to be a microservice as other things but it is important to say that we do need large language models and embeddings for this to work another service or set of services that we need is error detection and or fact checking so error detection is really critical because at all times part of our brain is always monitoring our own behavior to make sure that we are behaving correctly um and that we're not making mistakes so for instance if you say something wrong you might say oh wait i didn't say that right and then you get a unique signal in your brain saying hey you messed up um and so there's different kinds but we also monitor other people's behavior right we monitor reality around us to make sure that that what other people are saying are doing also makes sense so that's what error detection and fact checking does and then we also need some kind of executive or output microservice so for instance one executive service might be a decision to speak right so you might have a test a text to speech module that says okay given all these decisions that i made let me generate a dialog option and say it that sort of thing so these are just kind of a handful of the first microservices that are planned i've got a few of these started they're up on my github which you can just search dave shap and you'll see the some of my services up there so quick recap for the architecture section microservices only communicate with the nexus that is critical that is the definition of a star topology microservices are auto didactic meaning they focus on one task and they learn to do it better over time that's the key takeaways thought first model so what do i mean by that when you can think about anything how do you choose what to think about large language models around allow for arbitrary nlp which is natural language processing natural language generation and natural language understanding meaning they can do anything as long as it's a language based task they can do anything so they can think about anything so say for instance you fire up a large language model you can ask it to pretend to be a cartoon character you can ask it to wax philosophical um it's in they're incredibly flexible they're the first major step towards general intelligence towards artificial general intelligence but with great flexibility comes great risk because they can just as easily be benevolent as they can be evil so how do we steer these powerful machines this is the first problem that we have to solve and that's why i call it a thought first model of intelligence so the primary microservice for steering um uh the the moral behavior the ethical behavior of meragi is the heuristic imperative service so um over the last few years i've developed what i call the core objective functions or the heuristic imperatives which are listed here number one is reduced suffering for all organisms number two is increased prosperity for all organisms and number three is increase understanding for all intelligent entities so what do i mean by a heuristic imperative so a heuristic is that the machine must learn about these over time and develop its own understanding and intuition so whenever you look at any moral framework or whether you look at it through a philosophical lens or a biological lens or a psychological lens all morality and all ethics must be learned there's no um that's that's one of the universal things that everyone seems

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The goal of the heuristic imperative microservice is to ensure that the artificial intelligence system Meragi behaves ethically. The heuristic imperative is a set of three core objectives that the AI must learn about and develop its own understanding of over time: reduced suffering for all organisms, increased prosperity for all organisms, and increased understanding for all intelligent entities. By constantly learning about and striving to uphold these objectives, the AI system can be steered towards moral behavior.
