The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: the characters or setting again this might be a deliberate choice but more description would give the reader a better sense of the world and that the characters inhabit finally the dialogue could use some work in particular the dialogue between the protagonist and the dancer could be more natural and flowing as it stands it feels a little bit stilted and awkward overall this is a fun story with a lot of potential with a bit more development it could be even better um yeah so and since it's a relatively short story let's read it i had seen them all the simpler ones like bombers or shooters whose weapons i could absorb with smooth jazz the scientists who i could convince to lay off their plans by outsmarting them through beethoven bach mozart and the like the crazy teenagers who i talked off of buildings with lincoln park playing not only in my head but in theirs too in many cases the guy who poisoned the water of a town allowing me to listen to the band poisoned for a day that was one of the nicer ones and the more unusual ones the gal who wanted to turn the world into some kind of spaghetti monster forcing me to listen to we we speak americano on repeat the twins who i fought with nothing but duets in my ears you know fight fire with fire the businessman who wanted to buy the whole world stopped a series of seminars podcasts and ted talks on finances um that almost bored me to death i had seen them all in many more nothing could surprise me i thought well i was wrong because while the world's best dancer explains to me their evil plan to make everybody do the twist i realize there is only one way to stop this madness i press play and let the mental image of elevator doors opening uh flood through me and prepare for the ultimate dance off oppa gangnam style okay so yes definitely a sense of humor um the story is short and feels incomplete i agree with that um it it this is kind of a dreamlike sequence and that's okay you know it's possible the author was going for a more concise minimalist style that is a great assessment of the story second the story is very light on description yes this is so this is what's called narrative summary the person is just kind of summarizing you know alluding to things that have happened without providing much detail um but yeah so i would i would agree give a little bit more description and that could make the story much richer and more engaging finally the dialogue could use some work um yeah because there really isn't any um but you know having having a little a little pithy rep rt um would be interesting with the final final encounter uh so yeah i agree with this feedback if this person were to follow this feedback i think it would be a really interesting and more impactful story so there you go there's the prompts that i wrote um let's see so prompt generate completions let's go out um all right so download writing prompts so i downloaded those those are in the stories um and then i wrote prepare the prompt okay so what i've started doing is rather than kind of build everything all in one shot i break it out into smaller and smaller steps so that we can see it all so prepare prompts this is a really short script it runs in less than a second and all it does is read all the stories and fi and backfill the prompts and so if you look here the prompts are each of the stories and it just fills in the blanks so that we can check it before it runs just to make sure it looks right and then provide detailed professional feedback with suggestions in the format of a complete paragraph i actually need to rerun this let me show you how fast it runs because i updated the uh the prompt python prepare prompts and you see it runs in less than a second reload it and all it does is change professional editor feedback with suggestions example to improve pros so um we've gotten that far prepare the prompts and then um i have another folder called completions so i ran a few of them and you can see what they uh so the completion is here um consider opening a story with a strong image of abandoned factory town to set the tone the descriptions of the town towns decline could be more concise there we go a lot of those hard k sounds the story of rusty joe could be elaborated to make it more engaging the ending could be stronger and more unsettling so those those are kind of general feedback um but some of them are still there and so then in order to fully populate that what we're going to need to do is run the generate completions uh script and so this is this is where the rubber meets the road i'm just have a couple of basic functions for opening and saving i have another function for the gpt3 completions and this will actually need to be switched back to davinci o2 i'm not going to run it because i'm going to run out of quota um so i do apologize um but yeah then all it does is it just loads those prompts runs it through the completion and then saves it out to a file and that's that after that all you got to do is run the format json l which it will go through the prompts look for a file and then it will grab that and then pair it with the um with the uh it's commensurate um completions file because they have the same name um so it's just easy you match one to one it'll create the json-l and then there will be a fine-tuned script but again i have spent so much on this that i am going to have to wait until my quota resets um in a week okay so with all that i do apologize i did want to go ahead and get this out because it was a really cool idea um but if anyone else just takes this and runs with it please post results um and uh and let me know um otherwise sit tight and we'll come back to this in a week thanks for watching like and

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I had seen them all. The simpler ones like bombers or shooters whose weapons I could absorb with smooth jazz. The scientists who I could convince to lay off their plans by outsmarting them through beethoven bach mozart and the like. The crazy teenagers who I talked off of buildings with lincoln park playing not only in my head but in theirs too.

In many cases, the guy who poisoned the water of a town allowing me to listen to the band poisoned for a day that was one of the nicer ones. And the more unusual ones the gal who wanted to turn the world into some kind of spaghetti monster forcing me to listen to we we speak americano on repeat. The twins who I fought with nothing but duets in my ears (you know fight fire with fire). The businessman who wanted to buy the whole world stopped a series of seminars podcasts and ted talks on finances.

I had seen them all and in many more. Nothing could surprise me I thought. Well I was wrong because while the world's best dancer explains to me their evil plan to make everybody do the Twist, I realize there is only one way to stop this madness. I press play and let the mental image of elevator doors opening uh flood through me and prepare for the ultimate dance off... oppa gangnam style!

Okay, so yes definitely a sense of humor. Um the story is short and feels incomplete, I agree with that. Um it, it this is kind of a dreamlike sequence and that's okay, you know it's possible the author was going for a more concise minimalist style. That is a great assessment of the story.

Second, the story is very light on description, yes. This is so this is what's called narrative summary. The person is just kind of summarizing, you know, alluding to things that have happened without providing much detail. Um, but yeah, so I would, I would agree give a little bit more description and that could make the story much richer and more engaging.

Finally, the dialogue could use some work. Um, yeah, because there really isn't any. Um, but you know having having a little a little pithy repartee would be interesting with the final final encounter. Uh, so yeah, I agree with this feedback. If this person were to follow this feedback, I think it would be a really interesting and more impactful story.

So there you go. There's the prompts that I wrote. Um, let's see. So prompt generate completions. Let's go out. Um, all right, so download writing prompts. So I downloaded those. Those are in the stories. Um, and then I wrote prepare the prompt.

Okay, so what I've started doing is rather than kind of build everything all in one shot, I break it out into smaller and smaller steps so that we can see it all. So prepare prompts. This is a really short script. It runs in less than a second and all it does is read all the stories and fill in the prompts. And so if you look here, the prompts are each of the stories and it just fills in the blanks so we can check it before it runs just to make sure it looks right.

And then provide detailed professional feedback with suggestions in the format of a complete paragraph. I actually need to rerun this. Let me show you how fast it runs because I updated the uh the prompt python prepare prompts. And you see it runs in less than a second. Reload it and all it does is change professional editor feedback with suggestions example to improve pros.

So um we've gotten that far. Prepare the prompts. And then um I have another folder called completions. So I ran a few of them and you can see what they uh so the completion is here. Um, consider opening a story with a strong image of abandoned factory town to set the tone. The descriptions of the town's decline could be more concise. There we go. A lot of those hard k sounds. The story of rusty joe could be elaborated to make it more engaging. The ending could be stronger and more unsettling.

So those those are kind of general feedback. Um, but some of them are still there. And so then in order to fully populate that, what we're going to need to do is run the generate completions uh script. And so this is this is where the rubber meets the road. I'm just have a couple of basic functions for opening and saving. I have another function for the gpt3 completions. And this will actually need to be switched back to davinci o2. I'm not going to run it because I'm going to run out of quota. Um, so I do apologize. Um, but yeah, then all it does is it just loads those prompts, runs it through the completion, and then saves it out to a file. And that's that.

After that, all you got to do is run the format json l. which it will go through the prompts, look for a file, and then it will grab that and then pair it with the um with the uh completions file because they have the same name. Um, so it's just easy. You match one to one. It'll create the json-l. And then there will be a fine-tuned script.

But again, I have spent so much on this that I am going to have to wait until my quota resets in a week. Okay, so with all that, I do apologize. I did want to go ahead and get this out because it was a really cool idea. Um, but if anyone else just takes this and runs with it, please post results. Um, and uh and let me know. Um, otherwise, sit tight and we'll come back to this in a week. Thanks for watching. Like and subscribe and tell a friend.
