CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In the video, two men are seen arguing and then getting into a physical altercation. One of the men is knocked unconscious in the fight. A police officer runs over and restrains the victor. The ambulance takes away the unconscious man. The chessboard is ruined.

The video then goes on to summarizing everything that has happened up until this point. It is mentioned that the two men were arguing about a steamy romance scene that one of them had written. The situation quickly escalated and they ended up getting into a fist fight.

The video ends with the announcement that the person who made the video will be doing a live stream tonight.
