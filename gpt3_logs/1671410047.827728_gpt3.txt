0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:10:13.740,0:10:17.100
oh man I'll be I'll be jazzed if
it if it understands this okay
0:10:17.100,0:10:25.140
um great that worked uh now I have
a new problem here's the error
0:10:27.300,0:10:31.740
um please find a solution for this new bug
0:10:34.440,0:10:37.440
so what so the problem here is and I
0:10:38.400,0:10:44.760
um yeah that you're trying to join a list of
strings that contain spaces I don't think so
0:10:53.700,0:10:55.740
new page nope that's not it
0:11:04.140,0:11:16.260
replace no no I don't think that's it I
think we need to fix the um string encoding
0:11:17.280,0:11:20.040
um here's the last part of the error
0:11:26.040,0:11:29.400
I feel like I'm talking to like Hal 9000.
0:11:32.520,0:11:34.500
yep there it is that's it
0:11:39.660,0:11:40.260
yep
0:11:43.020,0:11:47.760
ah so we need to add the encoding to
to utf-8 right okay that makes sense
0:11:49.080,0:11:50.700
this thing is smarter than me
0:11:54.000,0:11:57.720
um okay so when we write it yeah
oh that's the problem I okay
0:11:59.400,0:12:05.760
um encoding equals UTF eight okay cool
but uh this took way less brain power
0:12:06.780,0:12:12.480
okay let's see if that works DLS clear
screen that was fast all right so now
0:12:12.480,0:12:26.980
we have 144 chunks of text let's see what the
biggest one is 20 uh [Laughter] uh [Laughter]
0:12:31.740,0:12:35.040
I think the uh I think the
OCR messed up with this one
0:12:38.160,0:12:45.360
why do you believe that the Sherman Act
okay I'm probably disturbing my audience
0:12:47.100,0:12:50.700
what's funny is that it got the capital
letters fine but then the rest it's like
0:12:50.700,0:12:57.360
no I wonder if it was like if the scanner bed
was like moving too slowly or something foreign
0:13:01.380,0:13:06.480
I'm sorry okay I'm gonna pause this
because I'm gonna keep laughing
0:13:11.400,0:13:15.300
okay I had to stop and make myself tea
I'm still probably gonna be looking a
0:13:15.300,0:13:24.240
bit I'm sorry okay now normally oh sorry oh
I don't know why this is so funny normally
0:13:25.440,0:13:30.720
um this would uh what I would do is just
delete data but in this case I don't want to
0:13:30.720,0:13:36.420
lose anything and imagine like what if half of
our files were like this so let's come up with
0:13:36.420,0:13:43.740
a solution so I'm going to with so this this this
this function works so I'm going to say okay cool
0:13:44.340,0:13:54.480
let's make a new script so let's go back over to
Chad GPT great that all worked um but it turns
0:13:54.480,0:14:06.600
out the OCR barfed on a few files so the um so
there are lots of duplicated characters such as
0:14:09.360,0:14:22.320
um please write a new script using Spacey or
nltk to um de-duplicate uh extra characters
0:14:23.880,0:14:34.380
um search through all the files in um see
what was the folder name chunks.text in
0:14:35.880,0:14:48.360
chunks underscore text um deduplicate deduplicate
characters um and then save the cleaned up copy
0:14:49.860,0:14:55.080
um in a new folder called um dedupt text
0:15:05.640,0:15:06.420
all right
0:15:40.560,0:15:41.400
will that work
0:15:46.440,0:15:50.160
I don't know if that'll work is Spacey that good
0:15:54.060,0:15:55.320
or T and Doc
0:15:59.160,0:16:04.260
um okay I think I'll need to add the
encoding but let's give it a shot
0:16:06.720,0:16:10.500
and let me make sure I've
got Pippin pip install Spacey
0:16:12.480,0:16:19.920
okay so while that's running I will do
save and we'll come back here and we'll do
