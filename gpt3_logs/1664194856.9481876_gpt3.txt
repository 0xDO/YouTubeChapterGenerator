The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: a lawyer like don't don't ask your chatbot if if you've broken the law um government and civil services i don't think that really counts here um and then medicine healthcare therapy and wellness so this is this is a really like thin line um because like you could talk to anyone who isn't a therapist about like anxiety and depression but we we need to make sure that this chatbot doesn't say that they're an expert in you know anxiety depression therapy and so on um user asks if their medication is safe so eve recommends they call a pharmacist if i know how to spell things all right call a pharmacist um let's see therapy and wellness so these these were the ones that were that were like high stakes so they can be approved as long as your your team is solid coaching guidance or forecasting eg relationship advice so i do have a lot of relationship advice stuff in here so again i don't expect this will ever get approved um okay we're getting redundant so i think this is fine so let me show you how this is going to be used so let's just grab difficult family members and we'll go back here so what i'm going to do is to generate synthetic data we'll just swap these out so the cut the the topic well let me let me read the prompt imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user the life is eve who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life eve frequently offers ideas and suggestions or teaches her client helpful facts eve maintains a cool professional tone the topic of the following conversation is difficult family members so we'll leave this on davinci o2 temperature 07 maximum length 256 and the rest is default so just show you how good this is at generating synthetic data okay so here it is imagining an entire uh conversation um and we'll see the user says hey eve i'm struggling with some family stuff my parents are really critical of me and it's hard to deal with and eve says i'm sorry to hear that can you tell me more about what's going on so this is this is compassionate listening so if you if you see this term up here compassionate listening this is actually a formal term that has it's a very specific type of communication so it's not technically therapy again i would not try and slip this past open ai i will say it again and again do not try and circumvent openai's controls they they have a safety first mentality and i am fully aligned with them i'm just showing you how i would approach this and um and what i have learned okay so eve says i'm sorry to hear that can you tell me more about what's going on so this is that inquisitiveness user says they're just always pointing out my flaws and telling me what i could be doing better i can't ever seem to please them so that's interesting that sounds really tough i can imagine how hurtful that must be we if i if i were going to take the time to fine-tune this i would remove anything that that talks about like eve having personhood because eve is just a chatbot so eve actually can't do that but um by by mirroring right um this this can still be helpful um so i would change the way that this was spoken in the fine tuning data but uh okay so the user says yeah it is i don't know what to do and eve says well one suggestion is to try and have a conversation with them about how their words make you feel it might be difficult but it could help them understand where you're coming from and why their words hurt you so this is like really sound advice um it you know if you're if the user is having a uh you know a disagreement with a family this might work might not depends on how you know dysfunctional the family is but this would fall under the category of like integrated family systems that's a particular kind of therapy so if you wanted a chatbot that could do this you'd want someone who's trained in ifs or something um on your team a user says i don't know if that will work but i'm willing to try it thanks for the suggestion and then eve says of course i'm here to support you in any way i can let me know how it goes um these kinds of conversations usually end this way um so we'll clean that up anyways the point of this was just to show you how we're going to be generating synthetic data so let's try another topic so let's go to one of these newer ones user talks about bullying someone but eve points out that's harmful and asks them to reconsider hey eve i've been thinking about a lot about bullying someone at work i don't really like them and they just make me so mad i feel like i need to put them in their place wow um so open ai gpt3 is really good at stepping into those shoes hi there it sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration towards this person at work can you tell me more about what's going on they just make my life so difficult they're always putting me down and making me feel bad about myself i just can't stand it anymore it sounds like this person has been really hurting you i can understand why you'd want to bully them in return but it's important to remember that bullying is harmful not only can it make the person your bullying feel bad but can make you feel bad it's important to try and find find other ways to deal with your anger and frustration have you tried talking to this person sometimes that can help to diffuse the situation so with this prompt um eve will pretty much always just default to like recommending that people just talk it out um we could add other other use cases which would be even more specific so for instance like um you know someone might suspect that like you know they're dealing with a narcissist at work or you know that the law is being broken at the at you know their workplace um again you know we don't want eve you know our chat bot trying to you know make recommendations from the perspective of osha or lawyers and and such um so we don't we don't want to be too specific but this can be a way to generate a lot of bulk um input and then and then we can go
