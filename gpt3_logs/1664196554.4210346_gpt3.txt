The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: like voice chat bots they're still using um oh what's the name of that script um but they're basically using like uh old-fashioned like dialogues tree scripts and a lot of people in in voice and chat aren't aware of llms yet so there's there's like that group over there that is doing chat and large language models lend themselves to um to chat really well but they haven't figured out how to use it yet and then you've got cognitive architectures which are really old they're used in all kinds of places like rockets um so for instance um uh like every every moon rocket well maybe not moon rockets maybe not battle but more recent rockets um they basically have a kind of of cognitive architecture where they're constantly you know because machines have those big machines have hundreds of thousands of sensors and little tiny controls all over the place and so you basically have a nervous system and then you have it sensing everything that's going on and it creates a hypothesis as to like okay you know i'm veering off course because this nozzle over here is out of whack so let me do a little experiment to try and get back on course and that's why um you know rockets either they fly perfectly straight or they just blow up um i'm getting another beer hold on okay yeah so on the one hand large language models are being used you know there's a million and one startups using large language models cognitive architectures are really old um they're older than a lot of of modern um ai right and so what i've tried to do especially with natural language cognitive architectures is show like hey look you can merge the two um so we'll see what what happens there are more and more people that are developing um more more sophisticated architectural patterns like loops nested loops intersecting loops so yeah there's probably people out there um blender bot by facebook or malmetta that is a very simplified cognitive architecture and they're coming out with more sophisticated models all the time um let's see uh let's see old zaney says i think the potential prospect of humans being the very first species to set off the whole race of who gets to conquer all of reality rather intriguing yes we might be the universal force born now there's another theory that um i like a lot cause when you when you read about physics specifically quantum physics and cosmology you realize that like reality is not what it seems i've got a couple of books um let's see let me show you here's a handful of books so holographic universe this came out in 1992 i believe so this is basically the idea that like okay maybe the whole universe is a hologram which we would call this simulation hypothesis now which i've got that book right here um and then you've got reality is not what it seems this is written by by an actual physicist um this one's written by a video game developer and this was written by a journalist who um i think he was a journalist but he focused on like physics and stuff anyways so you read books like that and then there's another one called grand biocentric design um i've got a grand biocentric design i see it right there and then there's the philosophy of physics which is by princeton university press um perfect pronunciation okay cool uh first day okay i think i'm all caught up um at least mostly caught up um yeah so what is the fundamental nature of reality so i i comically propose shapiro's law which is that all conversations about artificial intelligence are ultimately questions about quantum physics or the fundamental nature of reality so here we are shapiro's law in full effect um when you when you start to ask questions about consciousness intelligence sentience um where did we come from and why why is it that we believe what we do like the when when we have the idea that we can create a machine and these stories are very old so there's a there's a there's a book that my fiance loves it's called gods and robots which talks about how through fiction we have explored our own humanity in the guise of machines since forever um so talos is the uh the the the um was built um out of bronze but as a is a person a fully realized demigod basically so when we as humans imagine that we can create something like ourselves it makes us ask questions about who and what we are what does it mean to be human or alive or conscious or dave or whatever um and so when we ask those questions that so this is a philosophical term that entails it you cannot separate um what it what we are from the fundamental fabric of reality and so we you keep zooming out and you say okay well i'm conscious but you know this cup isn't or is it right maybe it is conscious maybe it because it has uh the ability to interact and and maybe it has an experience so that's pan psychism um but you know right now what's in vogue is materialism i actually put a a post or a poll on twitter materialism is by far the most popular thing um followed by simulation hypothesis actually which of course simulation hypothesis says we're all just running in a simulation but that begs the question who's running the simulation on what hardware and why so that just leaves you with more questions and answers anyways sorry i was getting uh getting distracted the question was oh yeah fundamental nature of reality so you start asking questions about the fundamental yeah old zany is like aha so someone's drinking and it's not me um but yeah so ai conversations always end up they either turn religious which again gods and robots that has been a conversation for literally thousands of years but then when you add in modern cosmology and and quantum physics you end up with with uh more questions like okay where does consciousness come from because here's the thing um one of the one of the most important implications of materialism okay so materialism let me just tell you materialism is very simple it is defined as you say um the only thing that's real is fi is a matter and energy everything

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Like voice chat bots, they're still using old-fashioned dialogue tree scripts. A lot of people in voice and chat aren't aware of large language models (LLMs) yet, so there's a group over there that is doing chat and large language models lend themselves to chat really well but they haven't figured out how to use it yet.

Cognitive architectures are really old. They're used in all kinds of places like rockets. For instance, every rocket has a kind of cognitive architecture where they're constantly sensing everything that's going on and creating a hypothesis as to what is happening. This is why rockets either fly perfectly straight or they just blow up.

I've tried to show that you can merge large language models and cognitive architectures. There are more and more people that are developing more sophisticated architectural patterns like loops, nested loops, intersecting loops. Blender bot by Facebook or Malmetta is a very simplified cognitive architecture and they're coming out with more sophisticated models all the time.

The potential prospect of humans being the very first species to set off the whole race of who gets to conquer all of reality is rather intriguing. There's another theory that I like a lot which is that the whole universe is a hologram (the simulation hypothesis). When you start to ask questions about consciousness, intelligence, sentience, where did we come from and why do we believe what we do, you realize that reality is not what it seems.

I comically propose Shapiro's Law which is that all conversations about artificial intelligence are ultimately questions about quantum physics or the fundamental nature of reality. So when we ask questions about who and what we are, what does it mean to be human or alive or conscious, we are also asking questions about the fundamental nature of reality. And we cannot separate what we are from the fundamental fabric of reality.
