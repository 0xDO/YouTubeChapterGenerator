0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:16:58.240,0:17:03.840
i'm doing where i'm trying to like summarize stuff
into chunks of 1500 characters or less this is all
0:17:03.840,0:17:10.400
going to be a moot point within a year um so this
is this is all just like an exercise in futility
0:17:10.400,0:17:15.360
um and then like you know because because this
stuff goes up exponentially right okay it did
0:17:15.360,0:17:21.760
succeed awesome so let's give it a try so this
stuff goes up exponentially um so what happens in
0:17:21.760,0:17:29.520
let's see tutor tutor scripts oh i probably need
to do a reload um so what happens when you know
0:17:31.200,0:17:39.600
when gpt 5 or 6 has a window size of let's
say um probably like a million tokens right
0:17:39.600,0:17:47.920
so a million tokens times 3 would be 3 million
characters and you divide that by 5.6 that's 535
0:17:47.920,0:17:54.560
000 words right so that's like almost lord of
the rings um that it could write in one shot so
0:17:54.560,0:18:01.440
let's say let's say your average long novel is a
hundred thousand words so you multiply that by 5.6
0:18:01.440,0:18:09.120
so your average long novel is 560 000 characters
you divide that by three and you get we need a
0:18:09.120,0:18:17.440
window size of 186 000 tokens in order to write
an entire novel in one shot so you know all
0:18:17.440,0:18:23.120
this work that i'm doing right now to try and
you know get get gpt3 to write a whole novel
0:18:24.640,0:18:33.520
this is an exercise in futility because you know
186 000 um let's divide that by by 4 000 so that's
0:18:33.520,0:18:39.520
46 times what we've got today and since this goes
up exponentially this is probably two or three
0:18:39.520,0:18:45.520
years away and gpt five or six or whatever will be
able to write an entire novel in one shot and so
0:18:45.520,0:18:50.880
then what we're going to be doing you know a year
or two from now i won't be fine-tuning all these
0:18:50.880,0:18:55.520
little chunks breaking it down into cognitive
tasks we're going to be fine-tuning entire novels
0:18:55.520,0:19:01.600
so all right with all that said let's see how we
did today tutor tutor scripts novel there we go
0:19:02.400,0:19:11.040
okay so let's grab one of these prompts
let's just grab alice in wonderland 32
0:19:13.120,0:19:18.080
and uh this is gonna be comically bad i'm telling
you um let's zoom out a little bit because there
