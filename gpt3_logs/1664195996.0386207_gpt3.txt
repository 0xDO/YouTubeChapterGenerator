The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: need to do a little bit better on handling memory uh but again recall is a non-trivial problem so you know so so sue me this is something that's going to be worked on for many many years to to increase raven's recall but that's how that's how that works and then you see the synopsis i use this quite extensively if you look in the in the logs here the gpt3 logs synopsis synopsis synopsis so this is used quite often um and that chat that prompt works like this let's go back here prompt synopsis so i give it just a simple example this is a following chat log so here is the example and i say give me an example of of this and then go through chat log and generate a synopsis so let me show you what that actually looks like uh let's see what synopsis here pick a random one so there's the example chat log khajiit i'm sorry you find me to be unfriendly and hurtful i'm just a computer program and right now i cannot handle all the information in the chat raven isn't able to chat with you right now so there you go and this this was a simple memory this was an output memory that's being summarized so obviously this is this is just one dialog and then it's being summarized to be a little bit shorter so there you have it that's how the synopsis service works all right so i've showed you uh let's see let me go back to a raven output so the corpus the corpus is raven's working memory this is this is the gold standard you put everything together there's a whole bunch of different services i've got i've got the feelings oh let me show you how the feelings work feelings are important so the feelings prompt is just really simple the following is a chat log list list the chat participants and how each one feels so i give it very explicit instructions as well as an example and then it spits it out um so this was this was just uh something i made up between myself and a friend and so it uh gpt3 has a really good ability to to infer mood uh and so then let me show you an example let's see raven prompt feelings all right so here's a whole chat log and it says khajiit is feeling contemplative and analytical khajiit is feeling uncertain raven is feeling uninvolved [Laughter] so that's a that's a good that's a good response again this could this could all use a little bit of work this is still very early but the point is is that raven is able to summarize uh conversations based on different different aspects whether it's generating a synopsis uh inferring feelings and so on um another service that i'm gonna add is let's see go back over another service that i'm that i'm going to add is where did i put it i need a conversation state service because one thing that you noticed during the chat let me bring the chat back up actually uh where is it there it is is i noticed that raven was not keeping track of the current state of the conversation uh let's see so like he's like i can't i don't remember what we were talking about so that was actually a pretty pretty good uh inference reading reading his own corpus and saying i actually don't know what we're talking about uh and then i had to ask you know uh some questions several times for before they really before they really stuck so the corpus is gonna be need to be summarized a little bit better but that's pretty much it this deep dive actually took a lot less time than i than i thought it would uh i've got all this you know all these running in parallel so it prompts gpt3 quite a few times and then saves it all to solar and then sends the output back to the discord receiver so the result has a 45 second timeout print result return json and if you go down to where it's in context it says response equals uh weight or send context and then it awaits and sends the output and that's it and that is how you get this so the key things that i demonstrate here are uh that raven does all of his thinking in natural language and that a corpus is basically a stream of consciousness or working memory so the raven spontaneously dredges all this stuff up together makes it all relevant and then uses this to generate a coherent salient output and that's that so thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, David Shapiro explains how the chatbot Raven works. Raven uses a number of services to generate its outputs, including a synopsis service, a feelings service, and a conversation state service. These services help Raven to keep track of the current state of the conversation, to generate summaries of chat logs, and to infer the feelings of the chat participants. Thanks for watching!
