0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:28:46.620,0:28:50.220
and let's see if the perfect email Hi
boss I was hoping I could schedule MIDI
0:28:50.820,0:28:53.940
I had it work recently I've been feeling
my workload is excessive and I'm starting
0:28:53.940,0:28:56.700
to feel overwhelmed I'd like to sit down
with you and discuss how I'm feeling and
0:28:56.700,0:29:00.300
see if there's anything that can be done
to lighten my load a bit that's great
0:29:03.540,0:29:09.240
okay it's basically just reiterating
it but um it's just yeah that's fine
0:29:09.240,0:29:13.560
so you can see how by having this iterative
process it kind of gets better and better
0:29:14.880,0:29:22.080
um yeah cool so I really like this uh just by
saying like write the perfect email like it
0:29:22.080,0:29:29.460
knows how to be polite um so we will we'll save
this prompt um I'll go ahead and come over here
0:29:29.460,0:29:38.520
and we'll do this add a second new line and
we'll do okay scenario and then perfect email
0:29:39.180,0:29:47.100
and then we'll save this as the um
prompt uh let's see scenario to email
0:29:49.920,0:29:56.580
not text okay so we'll use this to generate
the output emails and so what I did was I'll
0:29:56.580,0:30:05.460
have a folder where we'll have um we'll have the
actually I'm going to need to think about how to
0:30:06.300,0:30:10.560
how to do this because I've got the final
emails right this is the final output
0:30:11.580,0:30:12.780
um actually I know how I'll do it
0:30:16.500,0:30:22.560
uh I'll show you in a little bit okay I'll pause
again and do a little bit more work and then we'll
0:30:22.560,0:30:26.640
come back basically what I'm going to do just
so you know what to expect what I'm going to
0:30:26.640,0:30:31.140
do is I'm going to start I'm going to use those
Baseline intents to generate a few more of those
0:30:31.680,0:30:38.340
um of those of these types of emails so like we've
got the stories this is almost done and so then
0:30:38.340,0:30:44.160
I'll do I'll basically convert those to bullet
points and then I'll have the conversation and
0:30:44.160,0:30:47.760
then I'll have just the messy versions of the
email so instead of the perfect email it'll be
