0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.540,0:00:08.100
morning everybody David Shapiro here a quick
update um I put it I put out a call for uh people
0:00:08.100,0:00:13.320
to interview because I want to uh revamp this
Channel and kind of focus on not just my ideas
0:00:13.320,0:00:17.940
but I want to talk to people and I've had the
privilege of talking to some really great people
0:00:17.940,0:00:24.420
I've got a handful of of interviews some podcasts
lined up so stay on the lookout for those but in
0:00:24.420,0:00:31.260
the meantime what I wanted to do was kind of uh
as as 2022 winds down boy was this another year
0:00:31.260,0:00:38.940
you know it wasn't quite as much of a dumpster
fire as 2020 and 2021 um but it was a year and
0:00:38.940,0:00:47.400
I wanted to end on a slightly more optimistic note
I am uh forever optimistic my fiance says when I
0:00:47.400,0:00:51.840
talk about the future I get Singularity sparkles
in my eyes like an anime character so I wanted to
0:00:51.840,0:00:58.320
share that with you So today we're going to talk
about Singularity Sparkles uh and and why I am
0:00:58.320,0:01:02.580
super optimistic for 2023 I'm not even talking
about the distant future I'm talking about the
0:01:02.580,0:01:08.640
next 12 months so let's let's Dive Right In so
first um there was the just a couple days ago
0:01:09.720,0:01:17.700
um news about net energy gain from um from what
was it the Lawrence Livermore lab um in uh in in
0:01:17.700,0:01:26.820
America in the U.S so we have theoretically hit a
one of the biggest milestones in Fusion research
0:01:26.820,0:01:33.000
which is the amount of energy that it takes to
you know heat up hydrogen or helium and smush
0:01:33.000,0:01:40.320
it together and get Fusion that for the last 70
years has taken more energy to get ignition than
0:01:40.320,0:01:44.400
you get out of it so why there's a whole bunch
of reasons I don't want to unpack it there's
0:01:44.400,0:01:49.980
plenty of other great YouTube channels that go
into details um veritasium uh Sabin hasenfelder
0:01:49.980,0:01:56.460
like all kinds of people have great videos on
that but what I want to say is this is huge
0:01:57.480,0:02:02.940
um I think that this is just a leak I don't know
if it has been confirmed yet but if it's true if
0:02:02.940,0:02:11.280
we have had net gain then whatever they did
is this is going to set investment on fire so
0:02:11.280,0:02:17.160
the reason that I'm excited about this I've been
studying markets and economics on the side lately
0:02:17.160,0:02:23.520
so what this means is there's already a lot of
investment in Fusion this is going to turn that
0:02:23.520,0:02:30.960
up to 11. and the reason is because in the mind of
investors and speculators they're like oh well if
0:02:30.960,0:02:36.240
the Americans just figured out this critical step
that means it's possible right because until now
0:02:36.240,0:02:40.620
Fusion is always 20 years into the future right
it's always something that is hypothetically
0:02:40.620,0:02:46.380
possible but this says that it is physically
possible that it has been demonstrated that you
0:02:46.380,0:02:51.600
can get more energy out of fusion than you put
in so this is this represents a saltatory Leap
0:02:51.600,0:02:56.880
Forward saying okay this is no longer this is no
longer theoretical this is no longer hypothetical
0:02:56.880,0:03:01.920
it is actual it is concrete you can get more
energy out of it so now it's just a matter of
0:03:01.920,0:03:08.700
making it commercially viable so I I expect that
by this time next year we are going to see an
0:03:08.700,0:03:15.240
explosion in not literal explosion metaphorical
explosion in investment infusion and hopefully
0:03:16.200,0:03:21.120
um more people around the world will get
will get first light you know first ignition
0:03:22.320,0:03:32.100
um which the reason that Fusion is so important
is because um Fusion represents one uh safe
0:03:32.100,0:03:39.720
energy but two also clean energy but also
hyperabundance of energy so the sun is our
0:03:39.720,0:03:45.720
we we already have a fusion reactor in the sky
right and we can we can use it by growing plants
0:03:45.720,0:03:51.900
we can use it by collecting solar we can we can
harness Tides right and waves and stuff greater
0:03:51.900,0:03:57.360
that's a gravity engine but anyways point being is
Fusion is already the most reliable power source
0:03:57.360,0:04:03.360
to this planet but if we can do it in a smaller
scale locally then you can do it all the time
0:04:04.860,0:04:12.840
um it's difficult to say what what Fusion would
unlock because then problems like carbon not a
0:04:12.840,0:04:19.380
problem uh growing food not a problem salt
water desalination not a problem if you have
