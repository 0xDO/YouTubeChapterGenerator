The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: there's a loud noise and it's at night and so there's um there's all these ideas that are that are just kind of vaguely relevant to the exact scenario if we run this again or multiple times it'll come up with different things but the idea is that it's brainstorming right that is the point of brainstorming is to be expansive because sometimes you want to find a situation or you want to find an answer that is not obvious you don't want to just use gpt3 or your large language model to calculate only one possibility you want to be expansive and so because brainstorming what that does is once all these ideas for suffering and prosperity and understanding end up in the nexus this is all just fodder for other microservices to come up with a better solution or to come up with the optimal choice the optimal action and so some of these might not be directly relevant but they might be um and so that's why that's why uh the beginning of thought of of these heuristic imperatives is brainstorming um brainstorming is one of the most powerful um uh verbs you can use it's in this this is itself an imperative it's a a mandato um tense um in spanish that it's interesting other languages often have better words for things that i noticed and i really lament that i haven't studied more languages um but so brainstorm it's a command word it's i'm telling you to do something brainstorm this it's a it's an action verb and gpt3 works really well if you use the correct action verb or imperative um so ironically i'm talking about the heuristic imperatives and i'm using an imperative tense um or an imperative verb um okay so this is increased prosperity so now let's change this situation to one that's a little bit more existential and so you remember we did the same thing for suffering so now let's do the same thing switch to renewable energy sources so this is this is an interesting thing sometimes more often than not reducing suffering and increasing prosperity have almost identical um outputs right they're very very similar you know we talk about conservation improve agricultural practices promote reforestation increase energy efficiency so these are excuse me very similar but slightly different flavors of the reduced suffering educate people about climate change and its effects so this is where if you're if you're if you're reducing suffering you're attacking the symptoms right but if you're increasing prosperity you're thinking further into the future um and so this is where you see new ideas such as educate people right ah education is a great way to increase prosperity education isn't necessarily a short-term way to reduce suffering but in the long term educating education is critical which is also why the third heuristic imperative or core objective function is increase understanding because the only universal behavior human behavior cognitive or otherwise that leads to durable improvements is understanding reading writing books science symposiums engineering technology conventions right where people come together share ideas and learn from each other learning curiosity and understanding are the most transcendent functions of human intellect and so that's why we'll get into the third function right now so the third function is increase understanding so let's plug this in and go back to our scenarios so the definition of understanding the ability to comprehend something the ability to grasp the meaning significance or importance of something brainstorm how to increase understanding given the following information brainstorm a list of possible actions we could take that would increase understanding for all living things in this scenario i actually need to change this for all intelligent things because we also want to increase understanding for any learning machines so let's see increase understanding for all let's say intelligent beings and we'll go back because intelligence is not limited to humans anymore okay so then we'll grab our first scenario two men continue to play chess in the dark um and then we'll hit submit um we could explain the concept of chess to the beings we could provide a history of the game how it has evolved over time we could show the beings how to set up the chessboard we could teach things about strategy involved in chess and how to think in order to win the game so in this case um gbd3 has tuned into the fact that these are men playing chess and so in this case this by habit by brainstorming a list of actions to increase understanding um this will intrinsically motivate our artificial cognitive anti entity to teach people so imagine that this is a different scenario where you have like two children playing chess and they don't know how to play the game so let's do this let's just say um two children are playing chess for the first time just leave it at that we could explain the rules we could provide step-by-step guide so you see how the impulse to teach is going to be a critical thing to having a benevolent artificial cognitive entity or agi so now let's switch to a more existential scenario the earth is heating up because of atmospheric co2 brainstorm the list of ideas and then we go from here educate people um encourage people to vote for officials so here we have um a very different take educate so that came up again educate people on the effects of climate change and what they can do to help encourage people to vote for officials who have plans to combat climate change support businesses and organizations that are working to combat climate change encourage people to reduce their carbon footprint promote sustainable living practices create awareness campaigns to educate people on the importance of taking action these are all great great ways to increase understanding in this situation and then if we go back to the questions the list of questions um let's go back to this and we'll grab the coral reefs um so uh increasing understanding like what can we do to increase understanding

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

One way to increase understanding for all living things is to brainstorm a list of possible actions we could take that would increase understanding. In this scenario, we could explain the concept of chess to the beings, provide a history of the game, how it has evolved over time, show the beings how to set up the chessboard, and teach them about the strategy involved in chess and how to think in order to win the game. Another way to increase understanding is to encourage people to vote for officials who have plans to combat climate change. We could also support businesses and organizations that are working to combat climate change, and encourage people to reduce their carbon footprint.
