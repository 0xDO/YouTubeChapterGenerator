The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: like this dichotomy I guess this is the the kindest way of saying there's this dichotomy of Cutting Edge versus stable um okay so the next topic was AGI or maybe we'll do uh we'll do um let's see you should clip the last two minutes and upload a video to why to avoid the bleeding edge yeah I could do that um uh I've actually been thinking about starting to get a professional Editor to come pop up these videos because one thing that's interesting is that some people reliably watch all of my videos but most people only watch a few minutes right and so I'm wondering like maybe I do a highlights reel um Lex Friedman does that where he'll release like the whole video which sometimes they're like four hours long but then he'll also do a highlights reel it's only like 15 minutes so maybe I'll start doing that um if there's any volunteers who want to uh want to help me out with that um otherwise I'll just have to learn to do it myself oh well okay so um stable fusion and and copyright infringement um oh boy that's I'm not a lawyer so I'm hesitant to cut to comment on this um because with things like um the dmca and digital the Millennium Copyright Act and and a whole bunch of other um established litigation and jurisprudence anything you publish on the Internet is technically automatically copyrighted at least at least um at least written works are like if it's a book or short story or whatever I don't know about images though um so if someone knows specifically uh about that automatic copyright uh please let me know um so but so there's already murkiness right because if I write a blog post and it's in my name technically that automatically copyrighted um so but what does copyright protect against copyright protects against theft and then reproducing it you know and and passing it off as your own let's see someone says they could be liable yeah I believe law accounts that stuff is public yeah so like the uh i p law like copyright law is so complex um that's why I was just like I'm just I'm just guessing here right this is this is not even educated yes this is just based on my understanding um let's see avatars need to be able to go into multiple websites uh but when the avatars become more AI based well they need to be aware of covert spyware interesting interesting idea um I'll come back to that because that is a very good question but it also requires a little bit of unpacking um okay so the short version is um copyright law is super murky because then the idea is like okay well derivative works are allowed right if if you make if you put in a lot of effort and you um and you like make a parody of something that's allowed right there are Star Wars parodies or Star Trek parodies um musical parodies that is protected right that's a derivative work and that's that's allowed in most cases or many cases um so then the question becomes okay well is AI a derivative work but it's not created by a human or the human just had to put in a prompt is that actually value add or is this just a machine churning out derivative Works um if you can't put your finger on this person copied this thing exactly it's going to be really difficult right let's see um web scraping recently pronounced legal okay I'll have to take your word for it um I I have heard that's so many times at least for text-based stuff that scraped data can be used for AI because if you put it if you put it up publicly and it they don't just steal it then okay like yeah um all right so going back up so that was stable diffusion we had one request for AGI but now the conversation like seems like it has moved for um for uh let's see there's avatars so the idea so little ape Escape clut skate Club um sorry um says avatars need to be able to go into multiple websites or metaverses but when these avatars become more AI based will we need to be aware of code or spyware so I'm gonna have to make a few assumptions about what you're referring to so this um I think what you're probably talking about is going back to that idea of having an agent model of yourself or a world view um in the in this potential future with the distributed autonomous organization there's a virtual copy of you or a representation of your needs going around and interacting with other sources of information if that's I think that's what we what we're referring to 19th century our AI our AI artworks of the the are they the new camera yeah I mean you know there's it's possible that um that a AI art is you know because I mean when the when photography came out people said that's not art but you know we've defined that into uh into art okay so little ape skate Club confirmed that that's what I was talking about like having our digital avatars going elsewhere and and needing to be aware of spyware yes the short answer is yes absolutely because privacy your digital Avatar as a representation of you just the just the information it has about your beliefs and why you want the things you want that is a huge Target for privacy breeds so let's say for instance you've got someone what's a controversial topic that I can talk about um well I'm not going to miss anything just imagine a controversial thing that you believe in that you want um but it might be illegal right now right so let's say you live in a country where um guns are presently illegal or alcohol is presently illegal and you tell the atar like you tell you you interact with this with this with the Tau Network or something like it you say you know I think this should be legal it's something that I do all the time and and I'm not a bad person clearly our moral laws are just wrong um and so now you have you have basically admitted to a crime to to the network uh could that be used against you because what if what if consensus on the network says hey we need to go on Witch Hunt and find every you know Heathen in this network who is who is working our moral laws and wants you know and is using alcohol or wants you know buy guns or

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The question of whether or not AI-based avatars need to be aware of covert spyware is an important one. With the rise of distributed autonomous organizations, there is the potential for virtual copies of individuals to be interacting with other sources of information. If these avatars are not aware of covert spyware, it could lead to serious privacy breaches.

There are a few potential solutions to this problem. One is to have the avatar be aware of covert spyware and take steps to avoid it. Another is to have a human operator be aware of the spyware and take steps to avoid it. Either way, it is important to be aware of the potential for spyware to compromise the privacy of individuals interacting with AI-based avatars.
