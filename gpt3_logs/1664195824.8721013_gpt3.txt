The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here with a quick video this one is going to be a tutorial on how to use codex codex is still in private beta so by the time you see this things might have changed i'm not sure anyways let's go ahead and dive right in um we're just gonna do i'm gonna do a couple like python and sql queries and just basic stuff to show you kind of what's what's going on but first um you'll notice the model name is code davinci o2 and then the temperature defaults to zero which means it's deterministic and it'll put it'll output the same thing every time so when you're doing code especially if you describe what you want accurately you're going to want it to generate the same thing every time so temperature you generally want to leave that lower although sometimes you can turn it up if you want to get more creativity um i will do another video about all the parameters and what they mean but for now let's just go ahead and dive right in so ctrl enter to run this it says def get reddit data oh so you might notice that i didn't specify a language i'm going to hit escape because it is going off on its own so i didn't specify a language but the three um individual uh single single quotes that forms a text block in python so if i copy this out oops go to here so i'll just copy this code x01 save it so you see it's commented out basically now what do you think is going to happen if i run this well first i want to delete the stuff that i don't want right because it just kind of took it and ran with it so let's save that and then let's go here let's see cd python tutorial and then python codecs it didn't do anything all right because i didn't call anything um so let's do let's add this here so basically it wrote the function for me but if we go back to this i didn't actually ever call it so we gotta call the function that we wrote oh and let me increase the um font size of this i apologize so you can actually see it there we go okay now we're up to speed all right so then we'll just call this function and we'll do print this function and call it leave it at that all right so now let's see what happens ah name requests is not defined so what the heck um so let's just put plug this in and say uh let's go back to codex so basically what i did i know that went really fast so at the generally speaking with with python you'll see like at the very end if there's an error it'll tell you what the error was now it'll also give you the line right so it says line 7 and get reddit data response equals requests get url etc etc and it says name error or name error name request is not defined so that means it doesn't know what i mean by requests and if we look at line seven you see right here um it says i don't know what this is you didn't you didn't define this anywhere um so let's copy paste this in and and then we'll go to a different endpoint which is edit which is also still in beta so the edit endpoint works on works on code as well so what i'll do is i'll say fix the following error in this python script and so then we'll go back to my command prompt and we'll copy this and we'll say hey fix this error and let's see what it does ah look at that so can you spot the difference it has import requests up here so let's see if it fixed it for me import request that looks right oops let's go back to my command prompt and it returned the front page of reddit in json format which is usable that's a data format that's usable by clients such as python um so there you have it that is that is uh using codex and then the edit feature to fix something um let's see uh let's see if we can make this a little bit better whoops um hang on there we go grab that we'll come back to this and let's say modify the function git reddit data um let's see what do we want to pull instead uh to pull top posts from the last hour and let's see if edit works there oh that was quick it says top dot json question t hour i don't know if that's gonna work let's try it i don't think that that's the right format for for json um i think you have to put the dot json at the end i don't remember though let's see if it works what are you doing there we go hey it worked cool okay so let's go back to codex though because edit is fun but let's go back i promised i promised to show you how to do code so let's do code um all right so what are we going to do instead um i don't remember what the what the comment is on a sql query um what is the comment uh on a sql query it's been a while since i've uh used to explain commons yeah where is it uh dash dash okay it's been a while since i've done sql which so this is exactly what you'd use codex for it's like i haven't done this in a while how am i gonna do this okay so the following sql query um will give me all the details of the um post gray sequel am i saying that right postgre sequel um well just we'll just say post postgre sql database and then we'll leave it at that that's interesting code select from pg catalog pg tables there you go okay it's interesting that um that it had code so it wrapped it in xml um so that's fascinating so but i bet if we just do select um it'll there we go all right and then it it so here's the thing is it tends to just kind of take it and run with it whatever it is that you wanted it to do um let's see uh did of the sequel table of the table where schema name okay um let's see where was i gonna go from here uh let's do um the next query will um show me details of the um table indices i don't know if that'll work but we'll see what it does okay just pg indexes the table constraints oh interesting okay okay so it's just pulling all the different bits from postgre um let's see let's do powershell because powershell is something that i'm more familiar with and my brain just blinked what is the comment on powershell um import module [Music] psutil seriously why why is my brain blanking today uh powershell comment that's what i thought okay my brain just wasn't giving me

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, I'm going to show you how to use Codex to generate code.

Codex is a tool that can generate code for you, based on natural language descriptions of what you want the code to do.

For example, you can tell Codex to "write a function to get data from Reddit," and it will generate the necessary code for you.

To use Codex, you first need to specify the language you want the code to be written in. In this example, we'll use Python.

Next, you'll need to provide a description of what you want the code to do. In this case, we want it to fetch the top posts from Reddit.

Codex will then generate the code for you. In this case, it wrote a function that fetches the data from Reddit and prints it out.

If you run into any errors, you can use Codex's "edit" feature to automatically fix them.

That's all there is to using Codex! With this tool, you can quickly generate code for any task, without having to write it yourself.
