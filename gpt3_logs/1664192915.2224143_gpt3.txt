TRANSCRIPT: as time because i use time for the um for the file names okay let's try this again almost there answer questions your question is why why did the supreme pork overturn roe v wade oh i'm sorry that was probably loud okay now it's thinking okay so it's providing some answers cool cool cool it looks like it's giving some pretty satisfactory answers why did you freeze if it blows up i'll be sad now so this is kind of a boilerplate that was a long answer okay nope it didn't like that so i need to fix i do need to add in some of the uh darn okay okay so this this that's the bug that i was telling you about um error communicating carmack char map cannot encode character okay so we need to for all of the prompts we do need to add back in um this bit here just for whatever reason there are some there are some things that uh that it doesn't like getting in there all right so we'll come back here we'll do prompt equals prompt dot encode slash decode because this is just a reusable string so every time we talk to gpt3 we can run this prompt real quick and then you know actually even smarter we do it here do it once instead of multiple times okay maybe that's what i'll do i'll just have this in all of my gbt3 completion functions from now on let's do that and then we'll also do that in the embedding one so we'll do that here and instead of prompt we'll do content just to ensure that everything is encoded in a way that gpt3 will be happy with yeah okay so we've got the answers um and then we should be good here okay let's try it again enter your question here let's ask let's not give it such a softball question because we saw that it was answering so um what are the historical precedents that the supreme court looked at when determining whether or not to overturn roe v wade so this is this is a much more complex question um so we've got some key words in there like um egregiously wrong and cause significant negative consequences ouch okay so we'll see if this um less this more hardball question is uh gonna produce satisfactory results because that first question that i was asking um were were a little bit more um it was answered explicitly many times in the document but this one requires a little bit more um interpretation let's say and we see it's going through fundamental right that is deeply rooted in history okay sound basis and precedent states could not ban abortion as it violated a woman's right okay because basically i'm asking for like historical precedent so we'll see if it's good and it it it does look like it's talking about some previous decisions you know like 1973 that's somewhere in history um oh there's a long long response courts decided to allow states because they believed it is a woman's right to choose see that doesn't make any sense though allow states to ban abortion because it's a woman's right to choose well just if the states can ban it that doesn't make sense um okay because it looks like it's giving an explanation as to why the state's allowed it but it's not actually explaining the historical precedence so it it may or may not actually understand what i what i was asking while it's going through this let's look through the gpt3 log so this is why i love doing this so use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question why wait did i give it the wrong it's still asking an older question hold on oops why did the courts decide to allow that's not the question that i put in was it is am i losing my mind yeah enter your question here what are the historical precedents that's what i'm looking for why didn't it ask that question hold on what have i done wrong here oh i know what i did wrong i didn't actually populate the question um yikes yeah so here's what i did wrong um if i look at the actual prompt so this is the the summary but um yeah i have the question hard-coded yeah okay so query you have to populate that i'm not losing my mind i just didn't actually populate the query because i get the query and then i ignore it okay so we will do this we'll just also do replace query with query and i think that's it yeah okay but first let's see so we we know we know what question that it that it did ask it asked why did the courts decide to allow states to ban abortion okay that's a softball question let's see what the final answer was that it gave us um okay the supreme court has overturned a lower court ruling that has struck down a mississippi law that would have banned abortion most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy the 5-4

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The Supreme Court recently overturned a lower court ruling that had struck down a Mississippi law that would have banned abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In a 5-4 decision, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the court's three other conservatives in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that the law is constitutional. This decision is a major victory for abortion opponents and a blow to abortion rights advocates.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, states that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion. Thomas writes that the court's previous decisions on the matter (Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey) were wrongly decided and should be overruled.

In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to a Mississippi law regulating abortion. The law, known as the Gestational Age Act, prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The court first noted that abortion is a matter of great social significance and moral substance. The court then went on to explain that the Mississippi legislature had identified a legitimate interest in protecting the life of the unborn, which provided a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act. The court therefore concluded that the act was constitutional and reversed the decision of the lower court. The court also made clear that its decision should not be interpreted as an endorsement of all abortion restrictions.
