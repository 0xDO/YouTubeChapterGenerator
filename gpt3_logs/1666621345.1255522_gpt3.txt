0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
1:30:48.000,1:30:54.540
this user said that this user said that
imagine you could say it this opinion
1:30:55.440,1:30:59.940
is held by those Industries the other way up
1:31:03.180,1:31:10.800
so let me throw a hypothetical into the into this
is let's imagine a future where there's millions
1:31:10.800,1:31:17.640
of Tau users and there are opinions that are
diametrically opposed that are mutually exclusive
1:31:18.600,1:31:23.100
does the Tau Network try to reconcile that
or is the answer it just doesn't address
1:31:23.100,1:31:28.440
that issue if there's if there's that level of
antagonism how does that work in the network
1:31:29.220,1:31:34.260
Tau will never guess and will never
put words in your mouth it will always
1:31:34.260,1:31:39.900
be exactly what you told it that's
the whole point of using logic okay
1:31:41.400,1:31:48.000
but I guess maybe not how but let's say let's
say if my opinion is is we should feed everyone
1:31:48.000,1:31:53.160
and that you know I express that opinion and
you're in your opinion is we shouldn't feed
1:31:53.160,1:31:58.140
anyone people should feed themselves and so
from if those two opinions are expressed in
1:31:58.140,1:32:03.660
formal logic at least to my you know amateur
brain they seem like they're mutually exclusive
1:32:03.660,1:32:09.420
right is that right and so what how would how
would that be reconciled in the town Network or
1:32:09.420,1:32:15.960
would it not be reconciled it will not be it is a
contradiction there is a disagreement okay to do
1:32:15.960,1:32:21.900
so there are ways to mitigate it you can if
you think about creating a mechanism of debate
1:32:22.740,1:32:32.460
which is kind of again debate is kind of a game
another thing is um who how what consensus means
1:32:34.560,1:32:37.140
so we can say this thing that everyone agrees on
1:32:37.140,1:32:40.320
or the majority algorithm and so on
and this can also change with time
1:32:43.020,1:32:46.740
bottom line the users will have to Define how to
1:32:46.740,1:32:49.920
address these situations there
is no out-of-the-box solution
1:32:51.780,1:32:58.500
I see so to to to walk through a hypothetical
where there's any any any point of contention
1:32:59.520,1:33:06.600
um whatever the topic is if if there can be no
agreement on any particular solution part of part
1:33:06.600,1:33:12.180
of what happens moving forward is there might be
a discussion about even how to make the decision
1:33:12.180,1:33:17.400
what are the decision criteria or what are
the other um like there might be a debate
1:33:17.400,1:33:22.620
mechanism as you said or there could be um
maybe the rule is set that you only need 98
1:33:22.620,1:33:29.460
majority vote and if two percent disagree they
get ignored or you know but anything any rules
1:33:29.460,1:33:36.360
can be uh conjured up and eventually applied um
through the Tau Network that's why you need to
1:33:36.360,1:33:44.520
change the laws of changing the laws that's why
exactly exactly um that's it this is phenomenal I
1:33:45.840,1:33:52.920
it's still it still blows my mind when I when I
sit and think about the potential power of this
1:33:52.920,1:34:00.060
network because it is a Learning Network it is
a new kind of kind of collective intelligence or
1:34:00.060,1:34:07.800
or hive mind almost um between humans and machines
so just I want to then of course I'm excited about
1:34:07.800,1:34:14.220
this and I'll continue rambling about it forever
but I want to hear um uh Professor franconi um
1:34:14.220,1:34:20.340
you haven't said much in the last uh 10 minutes
or so where do you see Tau going like you know
1:34:20.340,1:34:25.020
obviously you're committed to this project what is
your personal dream what do you want to see happen
1:34:26.400,1:34:35.160
uh well I tend to be more pragmatic and less
of a dreamer in the sense of uh well dreaming
1:34:35.160,1:34:42.840
does not mean it does not mean unachievable means
longer term ring I have a shorter time dream uh
1:34:42.840,1:34:50.760
and I really see this already applicable as it was
mentioned before in these small communities I mean
1:34:50.760,1:34:55.020
like that we have several blockchain systems
maybe each one working with different kind of
1:34:55.020,1:35:00.600
rules smart counters for example the area of smart
contracts I think is as a natural application here
1:35:00.600,1:35:06.300
is a piece of code that nobody understands and
you can be fooled by anybody because you give a
