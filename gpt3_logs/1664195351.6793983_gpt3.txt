TRANSCRIPT: morning everybody david shapiro here back with a video about acog artificial cognition i was uh i started working on this while letting my coffee brew and i realized like wait i should be recording this um so let me just bring you up to speed with what i've done so far i haven't done much um but i jumped back in um i cleaned up the prompt list and i renamed it because um this initial set of prompts i was like i thought i was working on the cognitive control prompt but there's a step before that um so i let my brain kind of do its thing for probably about a month i think it's been almost exactly a month since i worked on this so that was enough time to let everything kind of digest in the background and so i had an initial prompt list and the first before you can do cognitive control you need to know what's going on right you need to know um what what has been going on um up to this moment you need to know uh what's important right now uh you know like are there any dangers are there any threats is there anything that's good that's gonna grab my attention um and so you got to kind of get everything up to speed because like imagine you like wake up right what's the first thing you do if you like wake up in the middle of a war zone you get oriented right so you need an orienting loop in order to um understand what's going on so in so what i did was this initial um list of prompts i say like okay what are my core objective functions and i'm gonna start calling these as a heuristic imperatives because calling it an objective function is throwing off a lot of people i'm finding an objective function makes it sound like more of a math term whereas a heuristic imperative is uh much more precise in terms of what it actually is so we've got the heuristic imperatives which is reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding and then we've got persona or what would actually be ego so basically as our cognition stays awake longer it learns about who and what it is so it forms an identity over time um and then we ask okay what were we working on what is our task and these are all prompts that exist right so they're all not all of them are here but many of them are here um so i've got these prompts started and eventually these should all be fine-tuned right because um you get a lot of variability um write a detailed list of potential actions yeah um okay so um and actually a lot of these are going to get changed out um so but let's see so tasks so what are we working on um so a huge part of goal tracking is saying this is what i'm working on this is my goal um and because part of uh like people with executive dysfunction their brain will switch goals or lose goals really quickly so like if you have adhd you might be like walking across your house and then you see something else that needs to get done and this is how i know that i at least have a little bit of adhd is because like i might be like cooking right and then i need to go get something for my room and then i'll see that there's a laundry basket i'm like oh i got to do the laundry right and so you see something and you change goals that is that is a lack of cognitive control so in order to to make to stay on task you actually need to ask yourself okay going back over my recent memories what is it that i'm working on and what should i be working on and but the ability to switch tasks is really important because imagine so that you know it might be like oh well adhd is so bad right it's like actually i saw an article recently that concluded that or was it a book i was reading i don't remember um it might have been a video i was watching i can't remember where i get information sometimes but the salient point was that adhd was actually probably a really powerful survival mechanism when we lived in forests and jungles and savannahs because it's like da da da da you know you're you're going and you're fetching water from the river and then you see like a lion and you're like oh got it you you change tasks immediately right and so by being aware of your environment and switching tasks based on what you see by being hyper responsive to your sensory input that's not a bad thing right you see an you see a crocodile in the river where you're about to get water you stop getting water and you pay attention to the crocodile you run back to the village screaming your head off right or so anyways point being adhd is probably not originally a uh uh a problem and the ability to stay on task is not always a good thing right because you think about someone um who who gets stuck on one thing and like will keep focusing like what is this like a a joke in a movie right where you've got like the person who's who's so heads down and focused on like filling out his forms that he doesn't you know there's a war going on and he's like but i need to do this task so being overly focused is bad and being underly focused is bad so a huge part of cognitive control is is not just staying on task with task switching so that's what this prompt will do another one is empathy so humans have mirror neurons and canonical neurons and all sorts of other systems in our brain that allow us to automatically track the emotional state of people around us um and we want our our acog to do that as well because like if we're if we're getting angry at it like you're not listening to me we want it to be aware of that um or if we're sad and it it needs to know that we're sad so that it can be like what's wrong you know um the the stereotypical robot is one that like doesn't ask you like you know like oh well i'm just gonna be pure logic right you don't want that um metacognition this one may or may not make it in um or this might be um an uh a metal loop so basically what metacognition is is it's thinking about thought so each of these individual thoughts is going to be like um you know all automatic um but this one metacognition that might be an like an observer so if you if you

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In morning, David Shapiro discusses his progress on ACOG artificial cognition. He explains that he renamed the prompt list to better reflect what he was working on- cognitive control. He explains that persona or ego is another important prompt, and that over time, ACOG will form an identity. He goes on to say that a huge part of goal tracking is being able to remember what the goal is, and that part of cognitive control is also being able to switch tasks. He finishes by discussing empathy and metacognition, and how they will be important factors in ACOG's development.
