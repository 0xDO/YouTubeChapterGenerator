The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: while it's running in the background and that'll be that'll be half of our of our premises big jeff is an unlikely hero a portly space trader oh man these are great in a galaxy far far away young farmer really really it's just copying star wars that's fine um okay so we can't expect gbt3 to always be super unique but um that's fine we don't need it to be so this starts to get a little bit more complicated for these prompts so now that we've got material that we want to feed in we're going to need to add a few more functions and so what i'll do is i'll copy this because this script is just for generating premises so we'll do is we'll save this and now we'll say um we'll call this generate scripts dot pi because we will need to take um actually maybe we won't uh yeah we will need to take all this out because that does too much to the um to the thing we need to keep the format um we'll need to turn the temperature back down i think we're at 0.5 on here yep 0.5 we'll keep 500 tokens actually let's do a little bit more because the screenplay we want we want to expand this right um screenplay fade in it doesn't even have a name okay that's fine uh but yeah so we need this actually here let's copy this whole thing and the prompt for the script so then what we do is we add a token for the premise okay and we go here so um i just want to point out the original idea was to create a um was to create a outline generator but i realized that the the premise generator was more powerful than an outline generator um and so basically i'm moving the goal posts on myself and saying actually let's go a little bit further let's do something unique um and so we'll do scripts and so this is going to be the the script that um that matches matches what we're doing um we'll leave let's change the script write write a detailed opening scene um d write detailed opening scenes plural for a film with the following premise use standard script formats for hollywood films so we'll put in the premise and then the screenplay okay so and then i will also turn um you probably saw uh generate oh sorry generate scripts turn it up to a thousand tokens um davinci instruct can go up to four thousand um so this one so you see like that can go up to four thousand that's gonna get pricey and it's also gonna take a while so i'm not gonna go that i'm not gonna go that far okay this is done kira is a young woman born on a small space station okay cool so now we should have we've got exactly 100 premises we've got romance sci-fi what did i say oh fantasy okay so let's go back in here and switch to fantasy um how long has this video been okay we're at 46 minutes um and we're we're a good chunk of the way done um where was i oh yeah we are going to generate some more premises prompt premise so we're going to switch to fantasy and we're going to go from 101 to 126 and the prompt for the premise is going to be a random high fantasy story um this one will be specifically like well it says high fantasy so that implies magic and dragons um and then we'll do another kind of fantasy after this all right so let's let that rip and roll make sure that it's it runs uh the kingdom of alabaster really is in peril the king has been assassinated and the queen has been kidnapped this is this sounds fun far in the land of doran there lived a great kingdom people were thriving and happy under the leadership of king gelador that's cool um okay the triumphant dorm is restored wren a young woman of humble beginnings okay this is great um a young woman discovers she's recarnated princess of a lost kingdom that's cool she must ventures into uh yeah okay so that's running in the meantime generate scripts okay so we removed that um so what we have to do here is instead i'll leave that in place for now so we'll do import os premises equals os lister premises and so then what we'll do is we'll do four premise in premises and also you can do you can do a one-liner here um actually so let's let's do it that way because that's more pythonic for premise and premises uh we will do um uh let's see we'll say text equals i know with open because we'll use the same um yeah here we go we'll just copy paste this but instead we will say read and we will do for file name as in file premise equals infile dot read okay so now we will have loaded each premise and then we're going to do the same thing that we did here which is the uh script equals gpt3 completion premise um oh wait no the premi we have more to do um the prompt sorry with open uh let's see what was the prompt name there we go so this is going to be our prompt script and let me check on this see if it's done it is done okay so let's go update and i know i'm jumping around a lot but i multitask so basically what i'm doing is i notice that this is done so i'm going to go and update the prompt so this is a random high fantasy what other kind of fantasies let's do uh grimdark fantasy it that's all the rage right now so let's change this from 126 to 151 and we'll start that going again generate premises and so that just so you can see we've got 125 premises here um let's see when the last king of the realm was slain in battle all hope seemed lost but prince aidan heir to the throne was not ready to give up um okay cool life was never meant to be easy grown from the dirt and grime of the world the people toiled day in and day out yeah this is miserable okay all right where was i generate scripts yes generate scripts um so prompt script as in file prompt equals infile dot read um dot replace and we're going to replace the premise with the premise so that grabs that so basically we're saying the prompt is going to read this file and replace this part with the actual premise and so then we will say the script equals gpd3 completion of the prompt and remember the prompt now has the premise embedded um and so then that is the call to gpt3 file name um actually the file name will just be file name equals we'll say new file name
