The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: we're already breaking this down into a meta prompt um which is the cool thing okay um so let's go back into here so now we can't just enumerate all the prompts and just run them in order because that won't make any sense so we'll do prompt files equals actually this is going to be super procedural so we have to just do this one at a time all right so right intro equals prompt so what did i name this it's prompt intro.txt and then we will do argument equals gpth3 completion prompt okay and then we will do um actually here we can just shorten this do result dot append okay and then let's do the brainstorm brainstorm the rest of my essay actually we'll say critique to use the right terminology okay and so then we do we do this and we do brainstorm and so in this case we'll do um key points equals dot split lines okay so what we're doing here is when gpt three re sends this back we're going to split it into lines um so that way then we can enumerate for each line right for each point let's see and i think we need to make them stand alone um that's not right okay this is better yeah so this is okay when it says the author believes so what i'll do is i'll add the author to the beginning of the prompt so what especially this works especially well with um davinci instruct if you want a list of things and you want it to follow a particular format you just kind of start it and it's like okay the author does what and then it'll follow that pattern so then what we do is we just add this back the author said something to the beginning of um of the first one yep that should be fine key points um so then we'll say key points 0 equals key point actually we'll say the author plus key points 0. and the reason that i'm doing this is because this is going to get cut off it's not going to be part of the response so we want each each bullet point to be the same okay for point in key points now we get back into kind of this for loop um prompt equals open file and we're going to use the um prompt what did i call it the prompt point i come up with such original names prompt point dot text replace essay and then the argument is going to be gpt 3 completion we'll do that um yeah okay let's run this i think i think you guys will be surprised by this so basically what i've done is rather than me construct the argument i'm asking gpt3 to construct the entire argument because all i did was i said brainstorm i said brainstorm you know what the key points are and then in the first one um uh the intro i just said you know write the intro and especially so the introductory paragraph so that's what it's writing here okay um yeah so we've broken this down into three cognitive tasks which is write the intro brainstorm your points and then make an argument for each point let's see what happens cls to clear screen and then it blows up always does um what happened did i forget to do something um see 625 so did thorough assessment and evaluation yeah okay that looks right thorough outline of points the author oh that's what i did wrong i i yeah okay oops i used this one got to get rid of that we want that we want to preserve the new lines okay let's try that again so what happened was i went back through my logs this is why i keep logs and you see the response i said the author and then it begins by discussing but it's all on one line it's because sometimes what i like to do is compact the responses but in this case i don't want to compact the responses okay so let's try that again all right that's pretty typical for what we saw before yep it looks kind of repetitive so let's see what the final output looks like you see there's actually quite a few more steps so at 627 it ran it you know there was the introduction the brainstorm and then there was looks like four points that it made so let's go back out here and look at the output let's see this is a persuasive argument based on empathy and personal experience mills makes a compelling argument that illegal immigration is not necessarily wrong one weakness is that it does not offer a specific solution it looks like it's actually repeating itself almost verbatim let's take a look at some of those um some of these logs especially these last four because these are going to be where each point was oh that's what i did oops oh no wonder they look identical i'm not populating it um we're not using that we gotta we also got to replace um replace point good grief with the point because let's go to the gpt3 log and you see here where it's like the summary should focus on the following point point [Laughter] okay good grief i'm dumb you can tell i haven't had enough caffeine today yet it's also still 6 30 in the morning how long is this video while that's running oh this is 45 minutes yeah we're we're calling it here uh regardless but i think you guys get the point there we go i think this is probably good okay we're generating some output there we go oh wow it's kind of going back and forth but that's fine it is a little repetitive but this is certainly better okay so now let's see what the final output looks like reload it oh look at that this is long this is a 6000 character response i'm not going to read the whole thing but i'll save it in the output so you can see kind of what we've done and now you've seen meta prompting or prompt chaining in order to construct a very thorough argument i imagine with the right fine-tuning and refinement you could do the same thing for any kind of argument a legal argument or otherwise okay so i will go ahead and get this set up and um uploaded and uh you can check it out on github thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In this video, we'll explore how to use meta prompts, or prompt chaining, to generate a more thorough argument from GPT-3.

First, we'll need to write the intro. We'll do this by asking GPT-3 to brainstorm the key points of the argument. Once we have the key points, we can then ask GPT-3 to make an argument for each point.

Finally, we'll take a look at the output to see how well the argument was constructed. Overall, it looks like a fairly convincing argument, though it is somewhat repetitive.
