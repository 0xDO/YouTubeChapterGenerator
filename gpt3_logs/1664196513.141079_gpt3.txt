The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: little bit of data all right so let's see what oops let's see what happens um it might blow up i'm usually pretty good but i've got my handy dandy coffee alright key strengths are it's great for travel right size kids mode great for reading and netflix key weaknesses that has system lag poor wi-fi and dim screen let's see great for kids competitive does not have a lot of horsepower so it's weak though we keep getting that good for young children great value tablet affordability durable key weakness is that it is slow slow dim okay and then finally reduce system lag inqui increase wi-fi reception increase screen resolution make apps more user-friendly increase storage space and improve speakers so we've got some recommendations right off the bat and then it this is just a really quick summary now imagine you could do this recursively and this was only this was only um like 10 or 11 or 12 um queries to gpt three so this is actually a relatively cheap approach um let's run it again i'm gonna copy this out to a notepad document just for posterity sake so let's just copy this out so we can do a stair and compare when we run it again so let's let's run it again just to see if it comes up with similar recommendations and the thing is is like on the one hand i know that you know putting this in charts and diagrams and classifying each response like that is an old school way but like what we what we really need is the usable information what does a human want we don't need to translate it into numbers and then try and interpret charts we can actually listen to what humans want okay so make the tablet faster so performance that's popped up again make parental controls more user friendly that has popped up several times make the charger port more durable see i saw that pattern increased sensitivity of the touch screen improved quality of the camera so we are getting slightly different um different results that's fine but remember each of these chunks is is summarizing 250 reviews right um and there's also there's all kinds of of prompt um changes we can make so for instance for the original prompt we might say instead of uh write a detailed summary we can just say list right we could say list all the unique bits of feedback actually you know what let's try that this video is not that long it's only 17 minutes so yeah let's do some experimentation so one thing i noticed is that um i'm gonna remove this because this is this is bad for lists so we'll remove that that's fine um all right so let's do some prompt engineering so instead of writing a detailed summary let's do list all of the unique let's see what is it like unique recommendations or uh let's see points unique points that customers are making [Music] the customers say about this product we want to focus on um strengths weaknesses weaknesses and improvements okay so we're gonna we're basically we're going to ask for a list now so um so we'll say thorough list of all the keys strengths weaknesses and improvements for this product okay so we'll remove that we'll prime it with a list all right so let's just do this and then we'll just do one pass just to make sure that the output is what we expect so i'm going to go ahead and once it gets here i'll just do an exit zero so this is kind of just a quick debug poor man's debugging so i just wanted to do one pass and then show me the results so we'll do summarize reviews it'll grab 25 random reviews okay it's a great learning device for kids with a wide variety of educational programs inexpensive very durable slow cameras is poor wow okay great this looks really great um yeah um all right so let's let this go and we'll see yep recommended improvements for the product um so we'll we'll uh we'll just let it summarize that um i didn't say summarize yeah i said read the review of the summaries the summaries capture the general sentiment of the product um recommend some possible improvements the product to make customers happier perfect okay and then one thing that i noticed in the previous output is that they're all smushed together so when we do the print when we do print response we'll um we'll copy this so that there will be some vertical um some some space to break it up okay so let's see if we get even clearer results um summarize reviews all right let's see what happens and i'm going to drink some coffee perfect for kids super easy great parental controls tons of applications customers are generally very pleased lightweight user friendly fuse no it's going too fast no google play store great for kids great picture weaknesses kids mode not as good as expected so by asking it to enumerate things rather than summarize or i think we're actually getting more detail and so by getting more detail we're going to actually see patterns emerge more quickly and then did it freeze it fell asleep oh it generated a really long response okay so faster load times better speakers more control over the screen and keyboard and google play store so every time we run this we get slightly different slightly different feedback um i wonder if recommended improvements to the product so here we said thorough list of all key strengths and weaknesses let's do thorough am i spelling thorough right that doesn't look right okay i did spell it right [Laughter] um thorough list of recommended improvements to the product um so there we go so if you if you use those adjectives thorough list right because we notice if we go back in here sometimes um it didn't necessarily it generally followed the list but not always um and so by saying thorough list we're using an adjective so that's a modifier it's not just a short list right because we look at the we look at each of these where it gave us like a whole bunch of great points and then in the final one it just gave us four recommendations it's like that's not enough for me like i can't send that to a product team i need to i need to automatically send a report to a product team that is
