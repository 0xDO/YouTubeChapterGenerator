0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

CHAPTER TITLE: 17:28 - Exclusion from the Job Market



TRANSCRIPT:
0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

CHAPTER TITLE: 00:00 - The impossibility of containing a superintelligence

0:27:31.620,0:27:37.500
um characters long so this should be small
enough to run let's see how many tokens it is
0:27:43.380,0:27:47.400
um okay so that's now we're down to
2800 tokens let me remove the Json part
0:27:48.420,0:27:53.820
so now we're at 2500 tokens
tops so we can do we can do
0:27:54.420,0:28:00.960
um we can do like 1450 so that's more than
twice as many tokens so let's see it's it's
0:28:00.960,0:28:08.040
more than twice as many tokens with uh 25 less
input so theoretically this should be the limit
0:28:10.860,0:28:16.020
um cool all right excellent I think this is good
0:28:18.360,0:28:24.480
all right so we're almost done for the
day um let's see what chat GPT said
0:28:25.200,0:28:30.780
do you duplicate characters yeah there we
go okay so let's do this for the D dupe
0:28:33.180,0:28:41.580
um so let's come back here save it and
then we'll do python step O2 dedupe
0:28:42.600,0:28:44.640
all right we needed to add the um
0:28:45.960,0:28:57.720
Whatchamacallit encoding encoding equals UTF eight
and then for the right and coding equals UTF eight
0:29:00.120,0:29:05.700
okay so now if we go to the dedupt oh
actually here we need to delete this
0:29:09.300,0:29:12.420
it did all of them interesting um
0:29:18.900,0:29:22.080
oh it that's no if if not in file
0:29:25.260,0:29:27.180
it got the logic wrong I'm like no it was
0:29:27.180,0:29:29.820
only supposed to do like five
of these let's try that again
0:29:32.760,0:29:36.780
there we go okay so now the largest
of these is eight kilobytes which is
0:29:36.780,0:29:43.500
plenty small so we come back to chunks and
we'll replace those replace yes so now our
0:29:43.500,0:29:50.220
absolute largest file is 10 kilobytes 9 300
characters so this should all easily fit within
0:29:51.360,0:30:00.840
um no this should all easily fit within our prompt
window here so now we need to just go ahead and um
0:30:03.060,0:30:06.540
run the thing so all right so let's say
0:30:09.540,0:30:22.080
excellent we are now ready to run our uh prompts
are you familiar with open AI python module
0:30:29.280,0:30:34.380
open AI is dot dot dot I'm wondering
if it's slowing down because
0:30:34.920,0:30:40.800
um uh people are waking up this is one advantage
of being a super early bird is I get up earlier
0:30:40.800,0:30:44.940
than like everyone else granted you know it's
always middle of the day somewhere in the world
0:30:46.500,0:30:57.540
um anyways uh so this may or may not help us with
um with this part so now let's see open file save
0:30:57.540,0:31:09.240
file open AI key text DaVinci 03 tempt that that
we can do this up to 1450 that's fine in code
0:31:11.340,0:31:19.680
all right so this I just cannibalized another um
thing um we do not want to clean that up because
0:31:19.680,0:31:26.700
this is going to be there that's fine all right
network error yeah I figured that would happen
0:31:27.600,0:31:36.180
um okay so let's do a refresh um I have
a folder called what is the name of my
0:31:36.180,0:31:44.700
folder God I have like chipmunk chip monk memory
it's hard chipmunk memory um called chunks.text
0:31:47.640,0:31:53.880
called chunks underscore text um
that is full of dot text files
0:31:54.840,0:32:04.620
um each file um please write a python
script that uses open AI module and
0:32:05.520,0:32:19.020
new module and calls um and uses text DaVinci
O3 as the engine we'll say as the model um
0:32:21.420,0:32:33.660
and uses the contents of the file
in the chunks folder to populate
0:32:34.920,0:32:47.820
a prompt The Prompt is stored as um let's
see prompt underscore Json LD uh citation
0:32:47.820,0:32:56.760
nodes dot text and has a placeholder called
um what did I call the placeholder chunk
0:32:59.580,0:33:03.120
called chunk um in other words
0:33:05.940,0:33:14.520
open the text file or no um let's
see open the prompt file then replace
0:33:17.880,0:33:27.840
chunk with the contents of the file from
chunks.text and use this as the prompt for
