The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: like oh i can do that i can do this i can i can grab this i can throw that um there's other parts of your brain that are constantly dredging up memories by association and so those associative memories say oh the last time i saw this person they said this to me right and so i could say something back right um and so by by constantly generating a menu of options that you can choose from um that enables your basal ganglia to then select a behavior now the same thing can happen let's say that someone's talking to you and you hear them say something wrong another option that pops up is i can choose whether or not to interrupt this person and correct them right so that's a choice and then also switching so as information changes you might change task so for instance you might switch from listening to interrupting that is a behavior change or a state change um in fact this tried this this was this is modeled in um in primitive cognitive architectures that are used for say like the mars rovers rocket systems all kinds of things video game characters it's called a finite state machine so finite state machine says that there are there are a number of states that this machine can be in or this agent so i can be listening i can be speaking i can be interrupting i can be walking whatever and so basically what the basal ganglia does for us and as an organic machine is it helps us choose when to switch between tasks so that's one of the next microservices that i'll be working on is the executive service but before i have the executive service i need to have thinking service cognitive services that generate those lists of possibilities so yeah that's where we're going i just wanted to post a quick update because this is super exciting i've got these three services running so basically all that's running right now is kind of the the underlying infrastructure i've got the simulation running the nexus is running and then the semantic embedding service and also you don't have to if you want to do this you don't need to use my semantic embedding service you can just use open ai's or any number of other services but i use um google's universal sentence encoder because it's free and fast and it's also geared for smaller payloads which is all i need i don't need to you know you see how long these are they're about you know one one to five sentences or so um and that's all i need so anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe and also please consider supporting me on patreon so i can keep this research going and as always it will be forever open source because this is too damn important to have paywalled or privately owned so thanks

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The basal ganglia is responsible for choosing appropriate behaviors in response to changes in the environment. This includes selecting the correct response from a menu of options, as well as switching between tasks as needed. This process is known as a finite state machine, and is used in many artificial intelligence applications.

Currently, I am working on a microservice that will help with executive decisions, but before that can be completed, I need to have a cognitive service that can generate a list of possible behaviors. This is all part of my effort to create an open source artificial intelligence system that is available to everyone.
