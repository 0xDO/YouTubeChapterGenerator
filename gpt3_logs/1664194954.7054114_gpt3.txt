TRANSCRIPT: hey everybody david shapiro here for a random video let me tell you what's going on okay so there is an unmet need in our domain where we're trying to build artificial cognition and we need to rapidly experiment and we want to do vector search embedding search the problem is the only tools for this are all like so there's we v8 which we v8 uh it allows you to store objects but it's docker only um which is it's fine or i don't know if it's docker only but you know it's its own server it's a whole server um then there's feis which is facebook ai similarity search which does vectors only it's great it's super fast they can do a billion and it can do clustering but it does not allow for any other context or data to put in it it's only a component it's not a fully fledged service and then there's milvis there's pinecone there's a whole bunch of stuff out here that are like enterprise ready and cloud ready but we're not there yet right i need something that is fast and disposable and lightweight like sql light but i need it for vectors that doesn't exist so you know what i'm going to do i'm doing vdb light so vector database light i'm going to do my own and that's going to be hosted on pipi um so i'm just documenting the process um i've written a module before i just took it down because i realized it's super out of date um and you know you see last last updated three years ago this was my this was my my pre my proto raven work my proto agi so maragi morphed into raven so it's been abandoned for three years um but i've done it before so let's just get going and see what we can do so the idea is it's pretty simple we're going to do sqlite but for vectors um there's a lot of unmet needs so for instance we need to um you know just keep it in memory right just a memory based vector search disposable also writing it to file right that that would be another great thing to do so let's get started um first i'll just copy my from my old from meragi we'll do we'll save this in um bdb light so that'll be my setup thing and this is what i use to uh set up dot hi this is what i use to actually uh upload it to um what you may call it uh uh wow my brain is not working right now it's a pi pi there we go okay so then we'll rename this to vdb light and we'll do version we'll just do 0.1 and description will be vector database light and the url we'll take that out because the url will be vdblight description equals long description which will be that'll come from the readme long description content type text markdown author david shapiro author email um we're just gonna say no one at gmail.com i don't even know my email address packages vdb light zip say false okay i think that should be fine so that's the first thing but now we need something that will actually work right let me zoom in a little bit so what is it that we're actually trying to build here um that is a good question so i need to do some testing right what are the requirements so let's just do some rapid prototyping let's do a language p python um okay so one of the requirements is in memory uh vector similarity search uh so basically we just start something up run treat it like like sql light and then you know we we need to be able to add stuff so index them and then um and then and then retrieve them i am not an expert i have no idea what i'm doing this is going to be usable it's not going to be optimized at least not the first version um if this takes off and we get we get people contributing that would be great you know if we can get some people um you know doing this in c plus plus so that that way it'll be faster more optimized that'll be great um okay but uh we need um objects and or metadata attached to vectors so what i mean by this is like in a relational database a relational database is basically just like a spreadsheet right so you'd have like uh row row one and then you'd have like um you know text info here and then you'd have a vector here and then you might have like um a timestamp right so we want i want to have this kind of stuff right we need to have an arbitrary amount of information with each record now here's the thing though because i'm doing agi research artificial cognition research i need more than one vector to store to be stored with with a bit of information so for each item for each object or record or whatever what i need to do so let's just say row two um it's gonna there's gonna be an arbitrary number of of uh information with it so like you know this will be you know agi memory one right um it'll be stored like that um and then we'll have oops vector one you know which would probably be like 512 uh dimension um similarity vector and then i also want to store uh vector two which might be a uh you know um 2048 uh similarity vector um because here's the thing um you want to have different different levels of granularity that you can search because there's going to be different speeds but you can also have vectors that have different purposes right and then i also want to have time stamps because all memory so this is this is critical absolutely critical if you have nothing else associated with a memory you need a timestamp because there's a there's a temporal component in human memories although the temporal component in our memories is all relative so you say i had you know a ham sandwich on the same day that like the lightning storm soaked us on our hike right all of our memories are relativistic because we don't have a unix computer in our head giving us a time stamp but machines are lucky because they can have a number that says it happened at exactly this time um so then you might also want to have like um file name you know you want to have you want to have an arbitrary number of fields that are then associated with a given vector right so this is this is kind of the goal i'm setting for myself easy right um all right what do i know what do i know that we need the primary thing that we need is um we're gonna

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The goal of this project is to create a lightweight vector database that can be used for rapid prototyping and experimentation in the field of artificial cognition. The database will be hosted on PiPi, and will be called VDB light.

The database will be based on SQLite, but will be designed specifically for vectors. This means that it will be able to store an arbitrary amount of information with each vector, as well as allow for different levels of granularity when searching. Additionally, the database will be able to keep all data in memory, which will make it more lightweight and disposable.

This project is still in the early stages, and so far I have just documented the process. I have written a module that sets up the basic structure of the database, and I am currently working on the code that will actually allow for vector similarity searches.
