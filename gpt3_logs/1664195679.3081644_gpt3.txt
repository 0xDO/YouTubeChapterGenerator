The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: you do with those questions is up to you um i've got everything documented let me show you so here's the repo you can you can come right here you can clone it yourself um i've got all the information here uh with at the very top of the readme i kind of have an explanation as to you know what you do this what you do with this oh most important thing duh um the the the training data is right here it's ready to go um it's 2.2 megabytes it's what's called json l which means json lines it's just json but instead of instead of being formatted as a list you assume that it's a list let me show you what that means so just edit with notepad so you see every line has one prompt and one completion and that's it so it's just a key value pair two key value pairs um and that is how it knows uh how the training data is used um let's see i also wrote a quick script um called fine tune dot pi that just has a couple of helper functions um let's see so i wrote a thing to help upload the file list the file for the purpose you just put in um fine tune um let's see fine tune the model list your fine tunes show the fine tune events and get your fine tuned model again just a couple of quick helper functions the the training data is right here it's ready to go you can use it just clone it down and you're ready to go i've got a i've got a little little tutorial right here the only thing that you need to make sure you do is add um the uh let's see where is it open a open ai api key dot text put your key in there um all of my scripts use that and it's added to the get ignore so it won't clone up to the repo um let's see i know i'm going super fast oh yeah so finally here's an example i wrote this tiny little context you can imagine um this going to a group chat right this was i kind of adopted the persona of like a teenage girl asking for help on the internet um so this is this is you know it's two sentences and this was the output that the fine-tuned model generated so it generated a dozen and a half questions about this situation and you can imagine that these these questions for for any number of people whether you're trying to help this girl understand um or you're her friend and or maybe you're a parent and you don't know the whole situation or if you're an agi agent and you have a record of text messages with this girl right um you could then cert use these questions to search those text messages to then create a better response and have a more human-like conversation so anyways there's a lot of things that you can use a question generator for and i hope that i hope that you find some use in it and yeah that's about it enjoy

==========

The Question Generator is a tool that can be used to generate questions about a given situation. The training data for the Question Generator is available in a JSON format, and the tool also includes a script called fine tune.pi that can be used to help upload the file and list the fine tune events. An example of the output from the Question Generator is included in the repository.
