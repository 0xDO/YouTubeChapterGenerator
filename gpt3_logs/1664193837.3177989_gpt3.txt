CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Our services use OCR and other IAI for automation which saves our customers hundreds of hours per year. If you're interested in learning more, please feel free to reach out to me. My contact info is below.

Thanks!

User vendor contact info is not the best, but it's a start. And again, this only took a couple hours.

User code email marketing should be really long and enticing. I need to provide examples to a system.

Hey, do you have examples for me?

User: No, just make some stuff up.

All right, so let's see what it says this time. Our services save our customers hundreds of hours per year - that's time that you can spend on more important things.

Okay, that's not so bad. The fact that this fine-tuned model can take any kind of generic input and generate a decent email output just with a couple hours worth of work is pretty good.

Let's try another scenario.

I need to write an email to my brother John. This is about his house that I'm helping him build. I am his general contractor.

The problem is that John is a tool. Really, what I mean is that he's demanding and has hounded off my foreman. John really needs to stop going to the job site to micro manage everything. He's got no effing clue how to build a house and I've been doing this for 25 goddamn years, so he needs to screw off.

Like, his house is months behind schedule and over budget, and he keeps blaming me. But really, it's mostly his fault. For instance, he intercepted a delivery of materials and sent it back because he imagined that they were subpar. But in reality, they were top-notch.

Okay, let's see how it handles this.

Oh, whoops. Here, let's just delete this.

Perfect email.

I'm being part of it.

Hi John,

I'm sorry to hear that you've been having some problems with the construction of your house. I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. I understand it can be frustrating to feel like you're not getting the support you need, but please don't go to the job site without permission. This is a safety issue for both you and the crew, and it's not fair to them to have to stop what they're doing to deal with an unannounced visitor.

I understand that you're concerned about getting your house finished on schedule and within budget, but please don't interfere with the work or blame the foreman. He's doing the best he can under difficult circumstances, and it's not his fault that you're behind schedule and over budget.

Is there any specific issue you have with the construction? Please let me know and I'll do my best to resolve it.

Thanks,

Perfect.

I think this shows that I have a universal email generator. It could use some improvement, but you know that's only 400 samples. Those samples can be improved. We can add more different types of emails to get a little bit better output, but I'd say that this is five stars.
