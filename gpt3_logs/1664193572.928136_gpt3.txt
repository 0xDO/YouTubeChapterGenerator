TRANSCRIPT: it's easy doesn't mean that it's easy to be good at so I had this conversation with my fiance earlier is um when you become an AI billionaire what can I do to be on your um let's see and then also the AI research lab says homomorphic encryption for ML training is something that someone I know does yeah so it's it's growing um very slowly there's only like eight people in the world who work on it but hey your friend is one of them um I don't know that I'll ever be a billionaire because I open source all of my work um yeah so oh speaking of um Ai and art I have decided to open source Auto Muse and so here's the story so I was working on auto Muse which if you're not familiar with that that is my attempt to write a full-length novel with AI and um I had some really good um has your opinion about the extent to which art is really just Advanced pattern recognition and not to shred it at all uh change after the text to image models have come out um the short version is no uh so this was this was a question um was about like what is art um no so the point of art is that it is a fourth communication it is a form of human communication uh that is that is Honorable uh and communicates ideas emotions so on and so forth um okay so anyways Auto Muse uh just Google it it's one word a-u-t-o-m-u-s-e um I have decided to open source automus and there's two reasons so one when I talked to the folks at Tau earlier I realized that everything that I want to achieve with artificial cognitive entities and um and and cognitive architectures they're working on right um and they're working on stuff that's more sophisticated than anything I could ever do myself um and so it's like okay cool like I'm just along for the ride um so you know uh what I can do is I can popularize these things I can be a voice for it because I can understand it and communicate it um and I can work on building consensus to buy into a consensus model the second thing that happened um so I guess to put it into perspective I realized that I have way more important work to do than trying like you know focus on generating AI novels um the the second reason was I got um oh Auto Glass looking bot nice to definitely see you live hello um are are you on Discord uh you don't have to answer but just hi um so the second reason is I got feedback from my editor today um I contacted this editor after hearing them on a podcast a couple of years ago and I just I made a mental note when I'm ready when I'm closer to being publishing I'm gonna work that editor because they think like I think and I want to work with them so a couple years later here I am I'm ready to go I sent them my novel uh about a month ago and they finally came back with some questions it was just like oh man like I know from watching and listening to other authors like how humbling it is to like send your workout to an editor or um or a uh a a a reviewer or an agent um and so I was ready for that like they it was so nice they sent like um they sent a couple emails like like we know that you're working very important to you and this is a very vulnerable time so just be ready I'm like whatever I'm ready um and so then I got the feedback or the initial like questions and I'm just like where are these coming from like holy mackerel this person is like I mean again I shouldn't be surprised right like they've they edit books all day every day professionally they specialize in it of course they know more about writing than I do because or they know about writing in a different way right because basically the the relationship between an author and an editor is a generative adversarial Network because I've got a book writing Network in my head and they have a book like shredding Network and so we have like this system of like Gans like and it's like okay so we have two of the like the most powerful computers on the planet right human brains working at like an exaflop I have an exaflop scale computer in my head running on 20 watts of juice and then there's another one that is trained for years to like attack my work and I was like yeah there's not a snowball's chance in hell that like I can make like polished novels with gpt3 that's just not happening um I got really close to generating a a first draft a rough draft but as someone else I know it's on YouTube or maybe it was in Discord someone pointed out that there is a there's a huge Gulf between a first draft of a novel and something that will actually sell and and take Market space and after getting feedback from an editor from a professional editor I see that even as someone who is a die-hard committed artist like I want to I'm going to spend the rest of my life getting better at writing novels and writing fiction giving people feelings and giving and giving people stories even with as much work as I put into it just one other person who is trained to to critic to critique that work like no it's not going to be possible to do this with gpt3 it might even not be possible to do to to Really fully generate a full novel and polish it maybe not even with gpt4 right even if even if we have an AI model that is 10 times smarter than gpt3 it might not be possible so I was just like all right there's if I open source automated and I'm not going to take anything um that sounds like you're ready to move on to the next project yeah so well I'm not going to move on from Auto Muse I'm going to release it all and get it as far as I can so there's a limited scope of what we can do right um so what I'm going to focus on is getting really good synopsis because that's a paragraph that can fit in gpd3 and then also generating plot outlines because that is also something that gpd3 can can do really well so I'll release all that work and probably then yes I'll move on but let's you know I've got a few other ideas kicking around anyways we're at just over an hour and I'm running out of steam so um yeah so someone says it's possible to do it in sections I'll say yes

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

It's easy to generate a novel with AI, but that doesn't mean it's easy to be good at. I had a conversation with my fiance earlier about what it takes to be a successful AI billionaire. We discussed the importance of homomorphic encryption for ML training. This is an important area of research that is growing slowly, but my friend is one of the world's leading experts.

I decided to open source my AI-generated novel, Auto Muse. There are two reasons for this decision. First, I realized that everything I want to achieve with artificial cognitive entities and cognitive architectures is already being worked on by Tau, and I am just along for the ride. Second, I got feedback from my editor that showed me how much work is still needed to turn my first draft into a polished, publishable novel.

By open sourcing Auto Muse, I hope to contribute to the development of AI-generated novels and to help build consensus around the use of AI in this area.
