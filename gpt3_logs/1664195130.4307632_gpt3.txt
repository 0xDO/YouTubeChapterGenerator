The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: example where raven's like let me look up a hotel for you raven doesn't know what raven can do right now raven has no model of self raven has no ego it's just an input output mechanism in order for it to be an entity it actually has to have a knowledge of itself how it operates what it's capable of and what it's not capable of right in order to like so for instance that speaks to self-correction and self-checking raven will ultimately need a model of itself so that it can have an identity so that it can have the ability to say i know what i am and this is what i'm capable of and these are my boundaries and constraints and then lastly self-monitoring self-checking and self-correction i talked about the principles the the the heuristic imperatives so these are the guiding principles that it will check against but then we still need to work out the actual code and data to allow it to do that right so you know words are one thing but then the code is another um and i'm working on all this i know this sounds like you know pie in the sky stuff but a lot of this is closer to being realized than you might think okay i think that's it i'm going to call it there this was a lot um let me know what questions you have and also if you want me to do this full time please like and subscribe the video and consider supporting me on patreon because if i get to a threshold where i can do this full time i absolutely will and i think the world will benefit from it so thanks for watching

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

In order for an entity to be an entity, it actually has to have a knowledge of itself - how it operates, what it's capable of, and what it's not capable of. This is what allows for self-correction, self-checking, and self-monitoring. Words are one thing, but code is another. I'm working on all this and a lot of it is closer to being realized than you might think.
