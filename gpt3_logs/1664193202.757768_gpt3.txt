CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The police are investigating a case, and it seems that the GPT3 instruction series does a little better with it. It seems like the series doesn't like sci-fi as much because this is a real plot.

One thing that I noticed is that, especially when we do lists, we need to disable the thing that I have here. I'll just go ahead and remove the resub. This will compress anything so that it removes excess vertical white space or just excess white space in general.

I think tomorrow or whenever I come back to this, we're going to loop through this again. We'll try and make each setting or each item a little bit better. We'll iterate on the characters, the plot, and the setting. We might also start doing some fine tuning.

 Given the following theme, expand upon this idea and explore the humanity and the philosophy of the scene.

More motivated by a desire for justice, she wants to understand. She is determined to find out the truth even if it means going up against powerful forces.

The theme here is that you want the truth no matter what, no matter how dangerous it might be.
