0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:34.880,0:04:40.560
and it so this is an export of of the simple
english wikipedia in a single file it's crazy
0:04:41.840,0:04:49.680
but there you have it i see i probably don't need
that anymore so i start with article equals an
0:04:49.680,0:04:55.520
empty string i could probably do a string literal
whatever i create a database connection to sql
0:04:55.520,0:05:04.480
lite3 i'm called simplewiki dot sqlite i get the
cursor and then i run start db so this function
0:05:05.680,0:05:11.680
it does create table if not exists and so
basically if you have to run this multiple times
0:05:12.400,0:05:17.200
you don't want to try and create it the same
table over and over again so this just says if
0:05:17.200,0:05:23.840
it doesn't exist create the table wiki um give
it uh these three fields so title article and id
0:05:25.120,0:05:32.400
and ensure that the id is unique so when you set a
unique flag on a on a sql database it just says it
0:05:32.400,0:05:38.720
guarantees that every value is going to be unique
in that particular column and that allows you to
0:05:38.720,0:05:43.280
ensure that you you don't get duplicates it's the
simplest way to ensure you don't get duplicates
0:05:43.280,0:05:47.360
there is one thing that you need to do to to
prevent errors later on and i'll show you that
0:05:48.960,0:05:58.000
and then what i've got is create index if not
exists title underscore idx on wiki title so
0:05:58.000,0:06:05.360
what that tells the database to do is to take
the title column that field and create an index
0:06:05.360,0:06:10.400
of it and what that does is uh it create i'm
not sure i think what was it see i looked it
0:06:10.400,0:06:16.880
up sqlite uses a b tree index um and i'm not
exactly sure what that means but basically uh
0:06:16.880,0:06:22.800
what an index does is uh it makes it so
that it's easier to search that column
0:06:24.160,0:06:31.280
and so when you do that it's it says uh
let we're going to create another column
0:06:31.280,0:06:36.720
that helps us find if you search for
a title it'll help you find it faster
0:06:37.520,0:06:43.520
and so that may that means that the database will
actually you'll get way better search speeds if
0:06:43.520,0:06:50.080
you do uh if you do a query such as where did
it go i actually don't have a query in this um
