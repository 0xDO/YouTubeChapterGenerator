TRANSCRIPT: end include character and setting names vividly depict the entire novel so this sometimes works and sometimes doesn't the reason that it's sometimes work and sometimes doesn't is because you um in order to get more creativity you got to turn the temperature up um so uh text davinci02 can be good at fiction it can also be God awful um sometimes it just generates a couple of generic boilerplate sentences and sometimes it generates you know the story about um freaking you know Marcus uh Fabius Aquila right like that was a cool story um but this this was the prompt that did that so rather than fine tuning which is really expensive and also Frozen it's rigid um and because then like you might need to fine tune it again um well okay so you generate this uh blah blah you spit it out fine um here let me show you um gpt3 logs date modified one of the most recent one um oh that's the summarization so that's not correct sorry hang on um I was doing some different experiments with like how did how to generate the fine tuning data um but okay so here's an example perfect brainstorming extremely long and this I this prompt um you can tell that it's shorter than the than the current prompt um I added a little bit more detail to get it a little bit more on point because if you tell it that it's a novel one thing that I noticed is that sometimes it thought that it was brainstorming um for a film right which we can do that but the whole the whole point of Auto Muse is to generate novels so I was like let's get more specific so genre science fiction literature setting Scandinavia time period early medieval so here's one problem with having a bunch of different appeal terms that you pick at random sometimes they don't they don't Jive um sometimes they do and it's hilarious there was one where it was like a little boy like a Scandinavian little boy in the third Century comes across a wrecked Viking ship and it's actually a portal to a Sci-Fi World Galaxy and I was like okay that's cool let's roll with it that is some serious mid-grade portal fantasy stuff but you know it fit it it made it figured out a way to make it work um so yeah and year 946 uh Norway is in the midst of a fierce winter um a small village of our rowing a single Viking longship breaks through the ice so you still get like um some weird stuff like this um and so what you want to do is if something is mostly good you want to be able to rate it and so what I figured out was um and this is interesting I've had no less than I think five people now um all comment either in Discord Twitter um or on YouTube about doing generative adversarial networks um and as far as I know it's all been independent so something is happening out in the world where everyone is like let's use gpt3 to do to do Gans and so I was like okay cool let's do that it's not a bad idea and it's something I've had kicking around in my head so um then we I came up with this idea because like okay you get you get a uh oops that's the summary one um so you get a synopsis right um here's a synopsis so you get a synopsis but then like you generate a whole bunch of them and some of them are garbage and some of them aren't so what do you do with it then um what I did was I just said grade the following synopsis on a scale of one to five and I gave it a few shot example of grading them um and so then I gave it uh three different examples synopsis in the fair you know like this is a short one it's not a particularly good one grade one and then here's a much longer one where it gives you names it gives you locations it has a very like it's very Vivid um grade five and then I have a mid length one which is still complete just not quite as much detail in grade three and so then I do you have it spit out another grade um this prompt works really well and so the idea here is that um when you want to generate a synopsis um oh so another thing you can do is I generated a whole bunch at random um to to because my original idea was to fine tune it which you're welcome to do that I've got the fine tuning data here but it costs like thirty dollars to run this fine tune job so that's why I don't recommend it because just in terms of raw token count if I spent that thirty dollars generating synopsis I would have had like 10 000 different synopsis that I could just filter based on criteria rather than spending thirty dollars to fine-tune a single model which I then still have to use at the old price right so in terms of cost efficiency I do not recommend using fine tuning right now I recommend breaking it into multiple steps of ordinary prompts because remember open AI lowered the price of ordinary gpd3 by 66 by two-thirds and fine-tuning is still the original cost so I do not recommend fine tuning right now it is stupid expensive in comparison so what you do is you you can plug in whatever you want here genre setting time period so let me just show you an example of what I mean by this um so we'll go to playground um and please don't copy exactly what I'm about to show you because this could be copyright infringement but imagine that you want like um imagine that you want genre this will be um uh let's see middle grade High fantasy foreign and then you say setting I want it to take place at Hogwarts time period this will be um 1992 story type um so story type uh what was I have a list so the story lines I think oh yeah action-packed character driven intricately plotted issue oriented non-linear um so this would be this we'll do a character driven um so we'll do let's see so character driven story um with uh let's see let's let's say Hermione as the uh Hermione as the protagonist um and then Pace whoops we'll say uh leisurely paced um focusing on Hermione I cannot spell I promise I focusing on Hermione and her studies um character so then the character uh was another set of things where you could just kind of choose um and since she's a familiar character let's see there's 30 different options so

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

Davinci02 can be good at generating fiction, but it can also be God awful. The reason it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't is because you need to be more creative to get better results.

Text davinci02 can generate a couple of generic boilerplate sentences or it can generate a story about Marcus Fabius Aquila. The prompt I used generated the latter.

Rather than fine tuning, which is expensive and Frozen, I brainstormed with the Auto Muse tool. I set the genre to science fiction, the literature setting to Scandinavia, and the time period to early medieval.

One problem with having a bunch of different elements is that they sometimes don't work well together. For example, I once generated a story where a Scandinavian boy in the third century comes across a portal to a sci-fi world in a Viking ship.

To get around this, I created a system where I would grade each synopsis on a scale of 1 to 5. This allowed me to filter out the bad ones and keep the good ones.

I also experimented with using generative adversarial networks (GANS). This is where you generate a bunch of synopsis and let the tool grade them. The idea is to get it to learn what makes a good synopsis so that it can generate better ones.

So far, this approach seems to be working well. I've been able to generate some good stories using Auto Muse.
