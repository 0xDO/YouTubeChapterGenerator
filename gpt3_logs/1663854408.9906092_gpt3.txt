0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:04:58.800,0:05:07.520
what if the emperor was like the rock um so
then let's duplicate that we'll say uh 1.1
0:05:08.640,0:05:17.120
punisha emperor if he was dwayne johnson um and
so there we have we have our first two embeddings
0:05:18.240,0:05:25.040
um now okay so what if we do the other one what
if we go the opposite way so like negative 1.0
0:05:25.040,0:05:29.200
that would be like a peasant right or
actually probably someone who doesn't
0:05:29.200,0:05:35.040
have free will so like a prisoner or something
um and then we say like zero so this is like
0:05:35.920,0:05:46.320
um someone with uh no free will or
agency um and also gender neutral
0:05:48.160,0:05:54.400
right so that's what a semantic meaning
is now with gpt3 the smallest one
0:05:56.160,0:06:04.320
if you go to their embeddings the smallest one
ada has 1024 dimensions so what happens is these
0:06:04.320,0:06:10.400
models are trained to break down semantic meaning
into many many different dimensions and da vinci
0:06:10.400,0:06:16.560
has 12 000 dimensions so here we are just we're
just doing uh doing it with one or sorry two
0:06:18.320,0:06:25.040
vectors of uh with two dimensions each so you
know this is this is like super super simple
0:06:25.840,0:06:31.680
all right so now you now you know the basic
of what i mean when i say vector or embedding
0:06:32.240,0:06:36.400
so again the only difference between a
vector and an embedding is that an embedding
0:06:36.400,0:06:42.480
has uh has semantic meaning um and each
of those positions is somewhat abstract
0:06:42.480,0:06:48.160
um okay so then what do you do with it though
like how do you compare one of these to another
0:06:48.160,0:06:55.280
i'm glad you asked so we're going to do a basic
um we're going to do a basic similarity search
0:06:56.080,0:07:02.240
we're going to do base a classification problem
so let's start with oh first let me introduce
0:07:02.240,0:07:13.280
um i've added import numpy as np so this is um a
standard math package i'll say module for python
0:07:14.240,0:07:19.200
and so when you do import something as something
else this allows you to refer to it as shorthand
0:07:19.200,0:07:22.160
so if i double click on that you
see that numpy is used down here
