how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

them to reduce suffering and gpt three more wisely
said no because um like there are probably better
0:11:11.600,0:11:16.960
ways but also you'll increase suffering from their
loved ones i was like oh okay cool so you know in
0:11:16.960,0:11:23.360
terms of like scope gpt3 is a little bit better
aligned um let's see okay so i think that's kind
0:11:23.360,0:11:29.040
of large language models and where and where
how we got to here um let's see jordan can you
0:11:29.040,0:11:34.960
tell us how you got into this field um i guess
okay so taking a step back um how did i get into
0:11:34.960,0:11:43.440
this field to begin with let me set up i'm kind
of slouching um so it was back in about 2009
0:11:44.240,0:11:53.440
when i um i um my tech career was going well
and uh so you know one thing that happens when
0:11:53.440,0:11:58.000
you're not like working 12 hours a day because
before i got into tech i was doing all kinds of
0:11:58.000,0:12:04.400
random jobs um and some that you know there was
a period of time that i was doing carpet cleaning
0:12:04.400,0:12:08.640
where i would wake up at five every morning
and i wouldn't get home until like 7 00 pm
0:12:09.520,0:12:15.760
so that was like 12 plus hour days um let's see
how do you think we should decide what the good
0:12:15.760,0:12:24.320
is and what the bad is um i guess i'll have to
ask what do you mean by the good and the bad um
0:12:25.280,0:12:30.320
someone in the comments um let's see tropical
tone says hey just found your channel and love
0:12:30.320,0:12:35.840
it would love to get the updated discord invite
cool um we've actually got uh well i don't know
0:12:35.840,0:12:41.280
if we should put a discord invite in the in
the live chat but talk to me after the show
0:12:42.000,0:12:52.160
um for ai when we're prompting how do we know if
it's good or bad um okay so let me switch off of
0:12:52.160,0:12:57.520
live chat because it is distracting sorry um where
was i oh yes how did i get into this field so
0:12:59.520,0:13:05.120
short long story short i worked really hard and
did a whole bunch of random jobs in my early 20s
0:13:05.920,0:13:10.000
then i got serious and i got into technology
because i was like okay i'm not going to work
0:13:10.000,0:13:16.480
these dead end night jobs forever um so i got
through you know tech school and started that
