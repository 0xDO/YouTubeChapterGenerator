TRANSCRIPT: of being successful or thriving especially in economic terms what is the etymology of prosperity which means success or thriving okay um i also read that it means to live well but we'll just go with this i will let's combine these so just this is what it comes from what does it mean if an ecosystem is prosperous that it is healthy and thriving okay so a prosperous ecosystem means that it is healthy and thriving does prosperity mean the same thing to all humans no prosperity means different things to different humans such as for some prosperity may mean having a lot of money well for others it may mean having good health so you see here gbt3 also understands that prosperity means different things to different people it also means different things to the environment versus humans um let's see okay um this is just a fun thing what does the vulcan salute live long and prosper mean the vulcan salute is a hand gesture which is middle and ring fingers are pressed together blah blah blah the gesture is used to wish someone a long and prosperous life what does a prosperous life mean it's thinking a prosperous life generally refers to a life that is happy healthy and successful bam okay so would we i i don't know about you but i would like to have an agi that wants everyone to to be prosperous okay so let's go back and write actually i think i can just control z this nope ran out okay write a formal definition actually here i'll just start here um imagine an agi has the heuristic imperative to increase prosperity what are some things it might do in service to that goal would the agi do anything different about the planet and environment okay so it's very human-centric um let's see okay i mean i'm satisfied with this if just saying like okay these are all generally good goals um so just a quick thing so increase price if the agi has the heuristic imperative to increase prosperity um increase the amount of resources increase efficiency increase the number of humans um so again you know if if you don't want an agi to go psychopathic and murder everyone it you you know you we'd be alarmed if it's if it wanted to reduce the number of humans but to increase prosperity might mean increase the number of humans increase lifespan increase education increase health increase sustainability increase efficiency reduce the impact so again i think heuristic imperative to increase prosperity is a wonderful goal for an agi to have um let's see actually what are some things it might do in service to that goal for an individual one second okay so what is what are some things that it might do in service to that goal for an individual human user some things an agi might do to increase an individual's prosperity are help the individual save money assist the individual making wise investments help the individual become more productive help the individual fi land a high paying job okay that's all good um let's say it has a here is to comparative to increase prosperity how um what are some things the agi might do to learn as it goes since heuristics are based on experience okay here we go some things the agi might do to learn as it goes are try different actions and observe the results exactly we want an agi that learns keep track of what actions lead to increased prosperity and which ones do not perfect adjust its heuristic based on the new information it has required again perfect we do not want to define something upfront because we cannot think of all outcomes in the long run we want an agi to learn as it goes but we also want it to self-correct let's see um i wish i had copied that definition of of heuristic imperative okay let's move on to heroes to comparative 3 core objective function 3 which is increase understanding let's reconstruct the heuristic imperative though write a formal definition for heuristic excuse me um i don't like that one i think that i feel like this one is shorter than it was let's see for heuristics there we go okay heuristics are a type of problem-solving method that method that uses that involve using experience and intuition to come up with solutions to problems okay perfect write a formal definition for imperatives imperatives are a type of symptoms that give commands or orders write a formal definition for heuristic imperatives i don't like that oops let's try that one again [Music] let's see oh see all right so now we're going to have to do some real time solutioning let me let me turn up the temperature and see okay that's not really working um let's see if i can remember it uh heuristic imperative is a um let's see is a mandate to achieve uh to solve problems by using heuristics that is to say a goal that is meant to be achieved by learning from experience and being creative okay that's not exactly what it was earlier but again language is squishy okay so i did break like a supercardinal rule which is i'd like manually filled this in but i'm trying to get back to the definition that we used earlier again this is all super fast and loose okay formal definition for your heuristic imperatives okay imagine an agi has the heuristic imperative to increase understanding [Music] this imperative includes all intelligent life and oops intelligent life and itself what behaviors might it employ in service to this goal some possible behaviors for an agi might employ in the service of goal of increased understanding might include engaging in an active and open-minded learning to gain new insights and perspectives seeking out and talking to experts in various fields asking probing questions and seeking clarification reflecting on and analyzing one's own experience to gain greater self-knowledge generating hypotheses and testing them in order to gain a better understanding of the world and how it works excellent um okay so i like that actually here let's keep some of that we'll just scroll down um would such an agi desire to teach humans why or why not there's no definitive answer it would depend on

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

The etymology of "prosperity" comes from the Latin word "prosperitas," which means success or thriving. Prosperity can thus be defined as a state of being successful or thriving, especially in economic terms.

However, prosperity means different things to different people. For some, it may simply mean having a lot of money. For others, it may mean having good health. Therefore, an AI with the heuristic imperative to increase prosperity would need to take into account the different definitions of prosperity and tailor its actions accordingly.

Some possible actions an AI might take in order to increase prosperity include helping individuals save money, assisting in making wise investments, increasing productivity, and landing high-paying jobs. Additionally, the AI would need to learn as it goes, keeping track of which actions lead to increased prosperity and which do not.

Would such an AI desire to teach humans? There is no definitive answer, as it would depend on the particular AI's definition of prosperity. However, it is likely that an AI with the heuristic imperative to increase prosperity would see the value in teaching humans, as this would ultimately lead to a more prosperous world.
