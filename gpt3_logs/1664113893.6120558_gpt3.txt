0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

every other turn Boat fish spice spaghetti
boat Dairy truck salmon Dallas Cowboys soup
0:14:57.720,0:15:05.940
desk Eiffel Tower gospel soap all right soap pops
up a lot but so anyways because we're picking a
0:15:05.940,0:15:11.460
random sampling every time the the profile of what
we're gonna is gonna also be different every time
0:15:13.800,0:15:17.460
um okay so I'm satisfied with
that so let's come back into here
0:15:18.540,0:15:23.280
yeah we don't need that anymore because we've
got our prompt so we we're basically just
0:15:23.280,0:15:31.440
dynamically generating a unique prompt
every single time um okay so then um
0:15:34.800,0:15:42.000
our stop sequence will be we need
backslash n to be one of our stop sequences
0:15:44.220,0:15:53.400
Okay so secret word equals gpt3
completion prompt will also set
0:15:54.900,0:15:59.700
we'll set the default temperature to let's say 1.2
0:16:03.840,0:16:09.840
um so yeah so we've got that we don't need
a thousand tokens we'll do we'll we'll
0:16:09.840,0:16:17.820
leave it to like 100 tokens um for this
one Okay so we've we pick a secret word
0:16:17.820,0:16:22.740
and so then we'll just do print secret
word uh just to make sure that it works
0:16:25.740,0:16:32.580
oh whoops I need to create my gpt3 logs
directory I always forget to do this gpt3 lawns
0:16:35.640,0:16:37.260
crocodile good one
0:16:40.320,0:16:40.860
computer
0:16:45.420,0:16:52.020
Jimi Hendrix yes okay I am satisfied that this is
a good we're getting a good amount of entropy okay
0:16:53.040,0:16:58.860
so obviously we don't want to tell you
the secret word so then okay uh print
0:16:59.760,0:17:04.740
um I have picked my secret word um
0:17:06.900,0:17:08.400
ask your first question
0:17:10.560,0:17:15.300
and so we'll do um questions remaining equals 20.
0:17:18.720,0:17:28.140
and we'll probably do something like um questions
remaining dollar s and then we'll add percent
0:17:28.140,0:17:34.860
questions remaining um and we'll just have this
in the debug out or in the output every time
0:17:35.760,0:17:39.720
um okay so then we say while true
so we enter into our infinite Loop
0:17:40.800,0:17:48.960
um the user the read host um let me make sure I
remember how to use read oh I'm sorry I forgot
0:17:48.960,0:17:53.760
to make this bigger sorry everyone's probably
squinting at the screen saying Dave make it
0:17:53.760,0:18:01.380
bigger I can't see there sorry about that okay uh
Python and then a equals I think it's just read
0:18:02.220,0:18:08.940
um read host is Powershell um and then
we'll say um ask your question scrub
0:18:11.820,0:18:15.240
or is it input a equals input
0:18:17.760,0:18:32.160
ask yeah um bacon and then print a okay
it's input not read okay um fair enough so
0:18:32.160,0:18:43.560
then you say so the the round starts you ask
your question so um question equals input um
