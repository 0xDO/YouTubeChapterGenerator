0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're
0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by
0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that
0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true
0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some
0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction
0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't
0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put
0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should
0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a
0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best
0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it
0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know
0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the
0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible
0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why
0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is
0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same
0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful
0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

TRANSCRIPT:
 0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update
0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think
0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper
0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me
0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is
0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for
0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good
0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far
0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine
0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion
0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the
0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for
0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits
0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that
0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially
0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a
0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order
0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including
0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world
0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

TRANSCRIPT:
0:01:59.440,0:02:04.640
they include that now is is
nice let me close my console
0:02:06.880,0:02:10.880
so once this is done it'll add
python to the um there we go
0:02:13.760,0:02:21.840
okay so python dash dash version 3.10.5 there
we go so pip install pip dash dash upgrade
0:02:22.720,0:02:26.320
so you can do this it's recommended
that that's the first thing that you do
0:02:27.440,0:02:29.840
and because it upgrades your package manager
0:02:30.480,0:02:36.400
so the command here is pip so that's the python
package manager install pip so you're telling
0:02:36.400,0:02:40.880
it to install something that's already there and
then the dash dash upgrade tells you to upgrade
0:02:41.920,0:02:48.880
now the very next thing you're going to want to
do is install openai if you want to use gpt3 this
0:02:48.880,0:02:53.840
is the module or the package that you can use
and all you got to do is copy that to clipboard
0:02:55.920,0:03:03.840
and you do control paste or shift insert
for a command line pip install open ai
0:03:04.880,0:03:12.240
and this is most of the way there so it'll run
all the dependencies and unless your system is
0:03:12.240,0:03:17.840
weird or something you shouldn't get any errors
here this is pretty straightforward and if you
0:03:17.840,0:03:23.920
already have open ai installed then you can
just add that dash dash upgrade and away it goes
0:03:29.280,0:03:36.720
that's giving me a few few notices
yep which is not on path that's fine
0:03:38.480,0:03:44.560
successfully installed ta-dah okay so we're most
of the way there you're most of the way ready but
0:03:44.560,0:03:49.920
now what how do you get code so if you watch my
channel you'll know that i have i do a lot of code
0:03:49.920,0:03:55.920
and i put all of my code up on github so how do
you get stuff quickly and easily the answer there
0:03:55.920,0:04:05.280
is you use git so you go to git dash scm.com
downloads or slash download sorry you get you
0:04:05.280,0:04:11.280
download git i've already got it but i'll go ahead
and install the update so you can see the process
0:04:12.400,0:04:19.520
so we will install git for windows um install
removing previous get version so this is pretty
