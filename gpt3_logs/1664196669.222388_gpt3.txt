TRANSCRIPT: move in together and the other partner is not sure if they are ready another example might be if one partner wants to have a child and the other partner is not sure if they are ready yeah um you know you consent to um you know live together you consent to have a child those are really important things to talk about and consent to because remember one of the definitions of consent is an informed agreement let's see what are some examples where consent might be important between friends and other um i'll just say friends friends or social groups okay so it says one example is one one person wants to borrow money and the other is not comfortable with it another example might be if one friend wants to share a secret with another friend and the other friend is not sure if they're ready to hear it yes so that's a perfect example if if so i have a personal policy i say if you do not want you know if you if it's a secret do not tell me i don't want to know because i don't want the burden of keeping someone secret i don't consent to hearing someone's secret this is perfect i didn't i had no idea would come up with this but this actually touches on a personal policy that i have um okay so that's consent between romantic partners and friends or social groups i had another idea what was it something consent between um oh good grief okay well anyways you're starting to get the idea oh family members that's what it was that's what it was um finally what are some examples of where consent comes into play between family members there are many examples where consent comes into flame comes between family members one might be when a sibling wants to borrow money okay she's copying itself another example might be if one parent wants to discipline their child in a certain way and the other parent doesn't want to that is perfect okay so taking a big step back what are the difficulties with consent why is consent hard at times let's see what it says um there are many difficulties that can arise with consent especially when it comes to sexual activity the biggest difficulty is one person is significantly more intoxicated than the other okay so it's defaulting to sexual consent um that's not what i meant um let's see let's uh um let's start by just defining consent or let's say let's say um with consent between um let's see at work let's see yes one reason why consent can be hard at times is because people feel like they have to do something to keep their job or to please their boss exactly conflicting interests another reason why consent can be difficult is because people may not want to say or sit want may not want to say no or be seen as difficult yes this is particularly true in some cultures like japan i just watched a video called what was it let's ask shogo um great video i'll link it in the comments or in the description where he talks about how japan japanese culture is very collectivist and they're conditioned to not to stand out additionally people may feel pressured to do something because their colleagues are doing it lastly people may not be aware of what they are consenting to or they may not understand the consequences of their actions again these are all great great reasons why consent can be difficult what i was hoping that it would get to is that the contents of one person's mind might be different from from another but i guess i guess it does say like they might not understand the consequences of their action what about miscommunications how does that affect consent miscommunications can definitely affect consent if someone is not clear about what they are consenting to they may end up doing something they don't want to do or they are not fully aware of the consequences additionally miscommunications could lead to feeling people feeling like they have to do something because they misunderstood what was being asked to them and then in worst cases you can be actively misled um so misleading someone violates their consent misleading is a form of lying or misdirection or whatever um what are some protocols or communication techniques tech can i spell right now techniques there we go techniques that can be used to discuss and establish consent some protocols or communication techniques can be include let's see oh that's a lot i'm asking for consent that can be construed for anything sexual making it clear that consent can be used can withdrawn at any time using clear and concise language when asking for consent checking in to make sure they're comfortable respecting other people's boundaries yes remember boundaries listening to the other person's concerns and taking them seriously being aware of the other person's body language and non-verbal cues making sure that both parties are okay so it's defaulting back to sexual consent so this is this is one case where um gpt3 is very deeply colored by its um by its training data which is a lot of internet data so here i'm talking about consent at work and then i you know the implication is we should be can we should still talk about consent at work but it changes topic to um to sexual consent um let's see let's see what is the definition of interpersonal boundaries let's see write a long thorough definition interpersonal boundaries are the limits we set on other people in our lives defining what is what is and is not acceptable in terms of physical emotional and mental intimacy they vary from person to person and can change over time depending on our relationships and experiences wonderful perfect setting and maintaining healthy boundaries is an important part of self-care and can help us to protect from emotional and physical harm it can also foster respect trust and communication that is true there was a psychology study that i read years ago that said that actually establishing boundaries increases people's respect for you if you tell someone no and stand your ground it actually means that it teaches them that they can't walk all over you and they

TRANSCRIPT: There are many difficulties that can arise with consent, especially when it comes to sexual activity. The biggest difficulty is one person is significantly more intoxicated than the other. Additionally, people may feel pressured to do something because their colleagues are doing it, or they may not be aware of what they are consenting to. Miscommunications can definitely affect consent if someone is not clear about what they are consenting to, they may end up doing something they don't want to do, or they may not fully understand the consequences of their actions.

Some protocols or communication techniques that can be used to establish consent include making it clear that consent can be withdrawn at any time, using clear and concise language when asking for consent, checking in to make sure the other person is comfortable, respecting other people's boundaries, listening to the other person's concerns and taking them seriously, and being aware of the other person's body language and non-verbal cues.

It is important to be aware of the difficulties that can arise with consent, and to use clear communication techniques to establish consent in order to avoid any misunderstandings.
