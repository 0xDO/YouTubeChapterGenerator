==========

Remember, I think that was about it. Um, yeah, so you know, accuracy, precision, but then confabulation whole new whole new animal. Um, I think that's about it. Yeah, so uh, gr good questions. And again, I just want to reiterate like I'm stepping into a new role as an educator. I'm not just sharing you know because most of what I've done up to this point is being like working entirely on my own. Um, just kind of like off you know writing books doing research which that's one thing, right? As an individual contributor, but as someone that like now people like a lot of you are asking questions and sometimes like we're on different wavelengths, right? Like I have been keeping up with synthetic data, right? The idea that you can use transformers to do synthetic data, but not everyone is up to the same speed, right? And that is me learning about my role, my new role as not just someone who's doing research and sharing ideas, but also as an educator. So if I have again, I'll just reiterate if I have not been as helpful as you would like, I'm learning, right? I'm I'm learning to teach and I'm learning to do this better. All right, I'm repeating myself now, so I'll go ahead and cut it off. But there you have it. Um, the short answer, yes, synthetic data is perfectly legit. Um, there are certain strengths and weaknesses as with all methodologies in science. So thanks for watching and uh check in check in again later.
