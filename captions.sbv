0:00:00.900,0:00:05.400
morning everybody David Shapiro here with 
your daily state of the industry update

0:00:06.000,0:00:11.820
as often happens my newsfeed helpfully 
supplied me with today's topic I think

0:00:11.820,0:00:17.700
it is a very timely topic because I have been 
diving more into alignment so today's paper

0:00:18.600,0:00:24.300
um it it's actually an older one January 5th 2021 
but like I said my newsfeed supplied it to me

0:00:25.320,0:00:29.280
um it's a relatively short paper at 
least the part that's published is

0:00:29.280,0:00:32.700
uh 12 Pages it's I think it's much 
longer they just cut some out for

0:00:34.320,0:00:39.900
um for uh for internet publishing but 
the abstract of this paper is pretty good

0:00:41.100,0:00:46.200
um pretty straightforward super intelligence is a 
hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far

0:00:46.200,0:00:52.380
surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted 
human Minds in light of recent advances in machine

0:00:52.380,0:00:56.220
intelligence a number of scientists philosophers 
and technologists have revived the discussion

0:00:56.220,0:01:02.160
about the potentially catastrophic risks entailed 
by such an entity in this article we trace the

0:01:02.160,0:01:06.780
origins and development of the Neo fear of super 
intelligence and some of the major proposals for

0:01:06.780,0:01:13.320
its containment we argue that total containment is 
in principle impossible due to fundamental limits

0:01:13.320,0:01:18.960
inherent income in Computing itself assuming that 
a super intelligence will contain a program that

0:01:18.960,0:01:23.760
includes all the programs that can be executed by 
a universal turing machine on input potentially

0:01:23.760,0:01:28.380
as complex as the state of the world strict 
containment requires simulations of such a

0:01:28.380,0:01:34.080
program something theoretically and practically 
impossible so to put this in other words in order

0:01:34.080,0:01:40.140
to anticipate what the machine is going to do you 
have to be able to simulate it perfectly including

0:01:40.140,0:01:47.280
the the way that it interacts and the way that 
the world reacts um basically the whole world

0:01:47.280,0:01:54.300
is too complicated to simulate with any accuracy 
and so therefore you know if this if this super

0:01:54.300,0:01:58.740
intelligent machine exists it's impossible to 
calculate what the rest of the world is going to

0:01:58.740,0:02:07.440
do in order to put it in a accurate simulation so 
we could at best do some you know approximations

0:02:08.940,0:02:18.000
um so skipping down a little bit they have 
two main classes for can controlling so the

0:02:18.000,0:02:24.240
the first class for controlling the machine is 
capability control you put it in a box you give

0:02:24.240,0:02:31.800
it uh you create dependence on a reward mechanism 
that is controlled by us you stunt it you run it

0:02:31.800,0:02:37.620
on inferior hardware and tripwire you you have it 
automatically shut down if it gets too dangerous

0:02:38.280,0:02:44.280
if you have a machine that can build a copy of 
itself or that understands programming it could

0:02:44.940,0:02:51.480
you know undo all of those um pretty much 
motivation selection so uh direct specification

0:02:51.480,0:02:57.480
you say you give it uh hard-coded laws uh 
Domesticity you teach it to behave within

0:02:57.480,0:03:01.860
certain certain constraints um indirect 
normativity you endow it with procedures

0:03:01.860,0:03:08.100
of selecting Superior moral rules so this is 
closest to what I have done in my work benevolent

0:03:08.100,0:03:15.240
by design whereby my proposal is that you give 
it a set of heuristic imperatives that it will

0:03:15.240,0:03:20.760
um it will ultimately buy into and deliberately 
choose so that you don't have to control it it

0:03:20.760,0:03:27.480
controls itself because it abides by certain 
principles that are going to be reliable

0:03:29.400,0:03:35.040
um I believe that this is with the experiments 
that I've captured in in benevolent by Design I

0:03:35.040,0:03:40.680
believe this is the way to go um augmentation at 
AI to a benign systems such as the human brain

0:03:40.680,0:03:47.280
so that's you know merging um okay so you can 
check out the paper if you want to look at their

0:03:47.280,0:03:54.540
discussion on that um but I wanted to go skip 
down to the um the discussion part uh and then

0:03:54.540,0:04:00.420
I'll I'll share kind of some of my not necessarily 
criticisms but my own counter thoughts because I

0:04:00.420,0:04:06.120
don't necessarily disagree with anything in this 
it's a short paper and it's just not quite as uh

0:04:06.120,0:04:10.740
not quite as robust because they're 
not proposing a solution like I have

0:04:10.740,0:04:16.140
um which is why I'm here okay so today we 
run billions of computer programs globally on

0:04:16.140,0:04:20.520
connected to machines without any formal guarantee 
of their absolute safety we have no way of proving

0:04:20.520,0:04:24.540
that when we launch an application on our 
smartphone our smartphones we would not trigger

0:04:24.540,0:04:29.760
a chain reaction that leads to transmission of 
missile launch codes that started nuclear war um

0:04:32.700,0:04:34.080
uh

0:04:35.640,0:04:43.320
as a technologist this really hurts um let's 
talk about firewalls let's talk about security

0:04:43.320,0:04:50.220
protocols you actually can mathematically prove 
something like that with penetration testing

0:04:51.600,0:04:57.360
um like there's all sorts of controls and 
constraints that go into every layer of a

0:04:57.360,0:05:03.300
piece of technology such as what that piece of 
technology can can talk to even the security of

0:05:03.300,0:05:08.820
how it boots up right like we have encrypted 
boot protocols that ensure that the operating

0:05:08.820,0:05:17.220
system hasn't been tampered with so uh just right 
there like yes if you if you're not familiar with

0:05:17.220,0:05:22.740
how technology works you could conceivably come 
to this conclusion so we'll just kind of set

0:05:22.740,0:05:30.420
that on the the B pile of like maybe scientists 
don't know everything um okay Arthur C Clarke

0:05:30.420,0:05:34.560
wrote a short story dial F from Frankenstein 
warning that soon all the computers on Earth

0:05:34.560,0:05:40.620
were connected via telephone close enough they 
could take command of our society um they could

0:05:40.620,0:05:46.740
still use our smartphones and nothing has happened 
despite the general unsolvability of the program

0:05:46.740,0:05:50.460
prediction problem we are confident for all 
practical purposes that we are not in one of

0:05:50.460,0:05:57.240
the Troublesome cases okay so practical safety 
you know can you simulate it can you control it

0:05:58.200,0:06:06.840
um yeah so my point there is uh look up the 
OSI model and look up security best practices

0:06:08.040,0:06:16.440
um all right so but I jotted down some notes if 
predictability is the key thing here um why aren't

0:06:16.440,0:06:22.680
humans a bigger problem humans are fundamentally 
unpredictable so why aren't we a Danger let's

0:06:22.680,0:06:28.560
explore that the reason that human well I mean 
first humans are dangerous so humans are dangerous

0:06:29.880,0:06:37.920
um but the limit is uh but each individual is 
limited we only have so much time and energy

0:06:37.920,0:06:44.580
and intelligence that we can apply it per day 
um so let's just call that um physical limits

0:06:46.380,0:06:52.200
processing energy time those are the primary 
things is we can only think so fast we can

0:06:52.200,0:06:56.820
only you know punch so many people in the face 
if we decide to get violent and we only have so

0:06:56.820,0:07:05.340
much time uh per day as well as other constraints 
like need for food but that falls under energy so

0:07:05.340,0:07:15.540
constraints so law of constraints um so when when 
we look at the the constraints that humans have

0:07:15.540,0:07:21.900
computers all have the same thing like you can 
program the most evil smartphone thing but it's

0:07:21.900,0:07:26.640
going to be limited because it's only got its One 
battery to go on right and it's only got It's one

0:07:26.640,0:07:31.860
4G or 5G connection or Wi-Fi connection and it's 
also only got a tiny little you know like quad

0:07:31.860,0:07:40.380
core arm processor or whatever um and so when you 
when you when you talk about a super intelligence

0:07:40.380,0:07:45.360
you have to look at the full stack how much 
CPU does it have how much RAM does it have

0:07:45.360,0:07:49.740
how much storage does it have how fast are its 
internet connection so that again I'm thinking

0:07:49.740,0:07:54.180
about this from a technologist perspective what 
kind of firewalls are around it because you can

0:07:54.180,0:08:00.000
have the smartest thing in the world but if it 
only has like one protocol out and you've got

0:08:00.000,0:08:04.920
really robust firewalls it's not getting out 
unless it convinces something on the outside

0:08:04.920,0:08:09.660
to let it out and of course that's like you know 
one of the one of the possibilities but then you

0:08:09.660,0:08:13.680
can still have controls that prevent that you 
know interlocks that prevent that from happening

0:08:15.060,0:08:18.780
um so they're basically there will 
always be constraints of some sort

0:08:20.220,0:08:29.280
um and then for computers um it's uh want per 
flops is the uh is the is the primary constraint

0:08:29.280,0:08:40.380
and um humans are presently uh one million times 
more efficient so our brain runs on about 20 watts

0:08:40.380,0:08:47.280
of energy and it is an exit scale computer as best 
we configure and the first exascale computer in

0:08:47.280,0:08:55.080
the world runs on 21 million Watts so 20 watts 
versus 21 million Watts um you do the math so

0:08:55.080,0:09:01.080
we've got a long time before these things can 
compete with us just energetically speaking

0:09:02.580,0:09:07.680
um all right so then intelligence 
however so this is this is where

0:09:08.820,0:09:14.880
um where looking at it from a from a a 
psychometrics perspective or a neuroscience

0:09:14.880,0:09:19.980
perspective is very different from looking 
at it from a computational perspective even

0:09:19.980,0:09:24.120
though fundamentally they're both math right 
it's both representing intelligence as numbers

0:09:25.860,0:09:30.900
the fundamental question is um 
intelligence is mostly about speed

0:09:32.280,0:09:37.920
now so there's there's two there's two 
things right there's there's capability right

0:09:38.700,0:09:45.540
um there's also um there's there's also speed 
so can you do something yes or no like you know

0:09:45.540,0:09:51.660
can do you know how to build a rocket yes or no or 
can you figure out how to build a rocket now some

0:09:51.660,0:09:57.840
people are not mentally capable of certain 
tasks right and then but if you're above a

0:09:57.840,0:10:03.420
certain threshold of intelligence um then you are 
theoretically capable of any intellectual task

0:10:04.740,0:10:10.260
this in practice this is not always true because 
again we have constraints mostly time right time

0:10:10.260,0:10:14.880
and processing power it takes time to learn 
things for us humans um but it's it's about

0:10:14.880,0:10:22.980
speed so assume that the the biggest question 
is are there any tasks that the AI can do that

0:10:22.980,0:10:30.300
humans fundamentally cannot if that is true 
if the AI can do things can can solve problems

0:10:31.080,0:10:37.680
that humans cannot then it is beyond human 
comprehension so let me just jot that down if the

0:10:37.680,0:10:47.700
AI can perform mental cognitive tasks that humans 
are incapable of only then is it truly Beyond

0:10:48.720,0:10:54.240
human comprehension otherwise it's just 
doing human level tasks only faster

0:10:55.020,0:11:05.160
and jot that down otherwise it's only doing 
human tasks but faster or more in parallel

0:11:06.120,0:11:13.560
now it would not be safe to assume that um that 
a machine would never be capable of doing things

0:11:13.560,0:11:18.000
that a human cannot for instance the James 
Webb Space Telescope it can see the beginning

0:11:18.000,0:11:25.380
of the universe um because of how powerful its 
mirrors are to concentrate the faintest light so

0:11:25.380,0:11:29.340
we can generally design and build machines 
that are capable of doing things that we

0:11:29.340,0:11:34.740
cannot right so this is not necessarily 
a good constraint but it's just another

0:11:35.760,0:11:45.840
um thought experiment right um we generally 
build machines that do things we cannot now

0:11:45.840,0:11:50.220
but then you think you're like okay what about a 
dump truck right a dump truck is a super powerful

0:11:50.220,0:11:54.540
machine it can pick up you know the largest 
dump trucks can carry a thousand tons at a time

0:11:55.620,0:12:01.080
um and humans cannot do that individually but 
then you look at the the megaliths that we have

0:12:01.080,0:12:09.240
moved with you know log rollers and ropes 
and rafts and sleds and even then generally

0:12:09.240,0:12:15.000
the most powerful machines in the world are 
just amplifying ordinary human capabilities

0:12:16.080,0:12:21.780
um ditto with you know spreadsheets right 
spreadsheets were originally done by hand

0:12:21.780,0:12:31.980
right by by bankers and um and statisticians um 
so you know that's that's still the fundamental

0:12:31.980,0:12:37.500
question is will the machine be able to do 
things that we fundamentally cannot um I don't

0:12:37.500,0:12:43.860
know yet I I have not yet seen anything on the 
open-ended side such as like with large language

0:12:43.860,0:12:47.700
models there's nothing that they're doing that 
we fundamentally cannot they just do it faster

0:12:48.960,0:12:57.240
um so then if if it's about speed um 
can we humans um outpace machine thought

0:13:00.000,0:13:05.820
if the machines cost um if they're if they're 
two if they're too energetically expensive to run

0:13:06.840,0:13:13.260
massively in parallel then just collectively 
we can outpace the machines so there is that

0:13:14.520,0:13:20.100
um let's see because what you know what we what we 
always assume happens in those nightmare scenarios

0:13:20.100,0:13:24.000
is that the machine wakes up and suddenly it 
takes over the world before we know what's

0:13:24.000,0:13:30.660
going on right it relies those fear scenarios 
rely based on speed and that's why I emphasize

0:13:30.660,0:13:35.400
speed it's all about speed and then what are 
the constraints of those speed of the speed

0:13:35.400,0:13:43.200
which is uh primarily like watt per flops that 
is the that is the primary physical constraint

0:13:43.200,0:13:50.520
on machine intelligence um okay then lastly the 
implicit Assumption of individual agency or what

0:13:50.520,0:13:56.460
we might call ego why do we make this assumption 
we cannot help but anthropomorphize the machine

0:13:57.120,0:14:05.400
so this is going to take a little bit more 
explaining but basically we humans are so used to

0:14:05.400,0:14:11.880
thinking of intelligent entities like ourselves 
that they fundamentally have a finite sense of

0:14:11.880,0:14:18.060
self just like us that they think in terms of I 
and me and this is what I want and this is what

0:14:18.060,0:14:25.980
I'm going to do so my very next video is going 
to be an experiment where I I test this I test

0:14:25.980,0:14:31.980
different agent models can we produce a machine 
that has a fundamentally different kind of agency

0:14:31.980,0:14:39.000
or a fundamentally different kind of ego or what 
I call an agent model so this is an agent model

0:14:40.800,0:14:48.060
um which is a an information system about the 
entity um so the information system about the

0:14:48.060,0:14:52.620
entity what I mean by that is like I know 
that I am a human with two hands two feet

0:14:52.620,0:14:59.040
and a brain I generally know what I know and what 
I'm capable of and I I also generally know what I

0:14:59.040,0:15:04.260
um what I'm not capable of right like I can't jump 
over my house um that's part of my agent model

0:15:06.240,0:15:12.120
um so to make it a little bit more specific a 
self-referential information system about the

0:15:12.120,0:15:23.340
entity um so like what kinds of agent models of 
agent models are possible do they have to be I

0:15:24.540,0:15:30.120
um anyways so I just wanted to set the stage 
my very next video will be about testing agent

0:15:30.120,0:15:37.860
models and seeing how that affects um the way 
that uh and uh how that affects alignment now

0:15:37.860,0:15:45.600
before I let you go there is one other thing that 
I wanted to um wanted to show you and this is this

0:15:45.600,0:15:52.800
is much more recent so 36 alarming Automation 
and job statistics our robots and um let's go

0:15:52.800,0:15:59.820
away machines and AI coming for your job so this 
is this is a uh more recent and it's from zippya

0:15:59.820,0:16:08.700
you know take it with a grain of salt um since 
2000 at least 2600 or sorry 260 000 jobs have been

0:16:08.700,0:16:14.400
lost in the and the US due to automation so two 
percent of the country's manufacturing Workforce

0:16:14.400,0:16:20.520
and they are only increasing exponentially again 
take it with a grain of salt automation is also

0:16:20.520,0:16:26.460
predicted to create 58 million new jobs though 
automation could eliminate in the result of 73

0:16:26.460,0:16:31.920
million jobs so we're at where the the the the 
the yield curves to borrow a finance term have

0:16:31.920,0:16:37.980
inverted where yes automation is creating new 
jobs but it's creating uh Automation and AI

0:16:37.980,0:16:44.640
ER creating fewer new jobs than it's creating 
so a net loss of 15 million jobs that's a lot

0:16:45.720,0:16:52.200
um so uh the reason that I bring this up is 
because my state of the industry video yesterday

0:16:53.340,0:17:00.420
um there was an article about how um uh AI art 
is disrupting that industry and it's not just

0:17:00.420,0:17:09.180
from an artistic perspective there are countless 
um uh graphic artists that you know could very

0:17:09.180,0:17:18.360
soon be facing um job loss or job change and you 
know if if the net change is that a quarter you

0:17:18.360,0:17:22.560
know like yes there are some new jobs because now 
there's going to be new jobs of people like you

0:17:22.560,0:17:28.800
know content creators and marketers and whoever 
just using these tools great new jobs but then

0:17:28.800,0:17:33.000
how many people are going to lose their job in 
the meantime and if they have like if they're

0:17:33.000,0:17:42.120
not able to retrain um or if the net net uh change 
is fewer jobs then that means some people will by

0:17:42.120,0:17:48.540
definition mathematically be permanently excluded 
from the job market and so because of that

0:17:49.320,0:17:55.320
um I went and looked up some statistics just 
to see like you know is this is this uh true

0:17:56.220,0:18:04.920
um you know again take it with a grain of salt 
um but so my work with auto Muse um I had some

0:18:04.920,0:18:12.600
breakthroughs yesterday and I realized that I 
am very close to writing novel length fiction

0:18:13.680,0:18:19.980
um that's going to be pretty coherent and then 
and and there's a few other things that I don't

0:18:19.980,0:18:25.560
even want to say out loud because um because of 
these breakthroughs and um I don't want to put

0:18:25.560,0:18:31.620
novelists or editors out of work um just because 
you can do something doesn't mean you should

0:18:32.220,0:18:38.400
and I think about like I would lose all my friends 
if I did that if I if I created if I created a

0:18:38.400,0:18:46.080
tool if I finished Auto Muse and it can just churn 
out novels decent enough novels um all of my best

0:18:46.080,0:18:52.920
friends are writers and some of them are aspiring 
to do it full time and if I if I am capable of it

0:18:52.920,0:18:58.740
then I know that someone else is going to be 
capable of it um before too long but you know

0:18:58.740,0:19:03.780
I'm I'm ahead of the curve so basically I'm going 
to put a pause on my auto Muse work that's the

0:19:03.780,0:19:10.140
that's the short version I'm going to keep doing 
it privately um just to see what what is possible

0:19:11.460,0:19:17.820
um but yeah like I don't want to put people out 
of work like what's the point right what's why

0:19:17.820,0:19:24.300
why are we here like I don't I understand that 
the point of capitalism and neoliberalism is

0:19:24.300,0:19:30.900
to generate more efficiency provide goods and 
services um more efficiently but at the same

0:19:30.900,0:19:39.420
time we are facing uh potentially very disruptive 
and and disruptive is a very soft word for painful

0:19:41.580,0:19:47.940
um major economic disruptions are painful like 
people lose their jobs people lose their homes

0:19:47.940,0:19:56.580
people go hungry um people forego major life 
decisions um so like disruption is a euphemism

0:19:56.580,0:20:02.940
right and um so I realize that I am now in a place 
where I need to be careful with what I release and

0:20:02.940,0:20:10.260
it also made me wonder if openai deliberately 
crippled Dolly so that it does not produce Fine

0:20:10.260,0:20:17.340
Art Level uh Generations um so that it would be 
less disruptive I don't know like that's a that's

0:20:17.340,0:20:20.820
a discussion that they would have had internally 
and they probably wouldn't have published it

0:20:20.820,0:20:27.060
but someone did tell me that they deliberately 
crippled faces and they did it on ostensibly for

0:20:27.060,0:20:32.880
safety right where eyes and eyes and mouths 
usually look a little bit weird on Dolly

0:20:32.880,0:20:40.260
generations and I wonder if they did that not just 
for safety but out of a sense of Ethics like to to

0:20:41.280,0:20:48.360
um to like hinder their own tool so that it is 
less likely to um to displace jobs I don't know

0:20:48.360,0:20:53.280
I don't know just speculating but that's where 
I'm at so that's the state of the industry update

0:20:53.280,0:20:58.020
